1915.01.01,"To start this diary rightly, it should begin on the last day of the old year, when, at breakfast, I received a letter from Mrs Hallett. She said that she had had to dismiss Lily at a moments notice, owing to her misbehaviour. We naturally supposed that a certain kind of misbehaviour was meant; a married gardener, I hazarded. Our speculations made us both uncomfortable all day. Now this morning I hear from Lily herself. She writes, very calmly, that she left because Mrs Hallett was ‘insulting’ to her; having been given a day & nights holiday, she came back at 8.30 a.m. ‘not early enough’. What is the truth? This, I guess: Mrs H. is an old angry woman, meticulous, indeed as we knew tyrannical, about her servants; & Lily honestly meant no wrong. But I have written for particulars—another lady wanting a character at once. Then I had to write to Mrs Waterlow about the chimney sweeping charges foisted on us, such a letter as comes naturally to the strong character, but not to the weak. And then we tramped to the Co-ops. in rain & cold to protest against their bookkeeping. Manager a bored languid young man, repeating rather than defending himself. Half way home we heard “British warship … British warship” & found that the Formidable has been sunk in the channel. We were kept awake last night by New Year Bells. At first I thought they were ringing for a victory.
"
1915.01.02,"This is the kind of day which if it were possible to choose an altogether average sample of our life, I should select. We breakfast; I interview Mrs Le Grys. She complains of the huge Belgian appetites, & their preference for food fried in butter. “They never give one anything” she remarked. The Count, taking Xmas dinner with them, insisted, after Pork & Turkey, that he wanted a third meat. Therefore Mrs Le G. hopes that the war will soon be over. If they eat thus in their exile, how must they eat at home, she wonders? After this, L. & I both settle down to our scribbling. He finishes his Folk Story review, & I do about 4 pages of poor Effie’s story; we lunch; & read the papers, agree that there is no news. I read Guy Mannering upstairs for 20 minutes; & then we take Max [a dog] for a walk. Halfway up to the Bridge, we found ourselves cut off by the river, which rose visibly, with a little ebb & flow, like the pulse of a heart. Indeed, the road we had come along was crossed, after 5 minutes, by a stream several inches deep. One of the queer things about the suburbs is that the vilest little red villas are always let, & that not one of them has an open window, or an uncurtained window. I expect that people take a pride in their curtains, & there is great rivalry among neighbours. One house had curtains of yellow silk, striped with lace insertion. The rooms inside must be in semi-darkness; & I suppose rank with the smell of meat & human beings. I believe that being curtained is a mark of respectability—Sophie used to insist upon it. And then I did my marketing. Saturday night is the great buying night; & some counters are besieged by three rows of women. I always choose the empty shops, where I suppose, one pays ½[d] a lb. more. And then we had tea, & honey & cream; & now L. is typewriting his article; & we shall read all the evening & go to bed."
1915.01.03,"It is strange how old traditions, so long buried as one thinks, suddenly crop up again. At Hyde Park Gate we used to set apart Sunday morning for cleaning the silver table. Here I find myself keeping Sunday morning for odd jobs—typewriting it was today—& tidying the room—& doing accounts which are very complicated this week. I have 3 little bags of coppers, which each owe the other something. We went to a concert at the Queen’s Hall, in the afternoon. Considering that my ears have been pure of music for some weeks, I think patriotism is a base emotion. By this I mean (I am writing in haste, expecting Flora to dinner) that they played a national Anthem & a Hymn, & all I could feel was the entire absence of emotion in myself & everyone else. If the British spoke openly about W.C’s, & copulation, then they might be stirred by universal emotions. As it is, an appeal to feel together is hopelessly muddled by intervening greatcoats & fur coats. I begin to loathe my kind, principally from looking at their faces in the tube. Really, raw red beef & silver herrings give me more pleasure to look upon. But then I was kept standing 40 minutes at Charing X Station, & so got home late, & missed Duncan who came here. Moreover, London on a Sunday night now, with all its electric globes half muffled in blue paint, is the most dismal of places. There are long mud coloured streets, & just enough daylight & insufficient electric light, to see the naked sky, which is inexpressibly cold & flat.*

* The Times today has an article upon the “Stars of London”—“We may gain from them a serviceable impulse to that steady concentration on enduring issues of which stars are a true symbol, & the glare of London is not”. So be it. (5th Jan)."
1915.01.04,"I do not like the Jewish voice; I do not like the Jewish laugh: otherwise I think (in Saxon’s phrase) there is something to be said for Flora Woolf. She can typewrite, do shorthand, sing, play chess, write stories which are sometimes accepted, & she earns 30/ a week as the secretary of the Principal of the Scottish Church in London. And in doing these various arts she will keep lively till a great old age, like a man playing with five billiard balls.

The outside world burst in upon us with a clamour this morning. 1. I had a letter from Mrs Hallett. 2. I had a letter from Lily. 3. L. had a document from Sydney Waterlow. According to Mrs Hallett, Lily hid a soldier in the Butler’s pantry; she also met soldiers at the gates; & thus Mrs Hallett’s house got a bad name in the village, besides which Mrs Hallett herself was alarmed ‘there being ladies only in the house’. Lily confesses merely to one brother, but adds that Mrs H. is very ill, as well as very old. As for Sydney’s letter—I am so sick of it that I can’t describe it. The house was dirty—4 people scrubbing for a fortnight only succeeded in making it tolerable; & so & so on—all of which would have been suffered in silence but for my note. So I wrote to him, & I wrote to Lily—& after spending some time in phrasing virtuous sentiments nobly, I see clearly how official skins grow thick & shiny. To Lily I said that she must promise to behave better, if I gave her another character—for I am sure poor Mrs Hallett & her trembling old sister heard soldier voices whenever there was a wind in the laurels. Philip came after luncheon, having 4 days leave. He is sick to death of soldiering—told us tales of military stupidity which pass belief. They found a man guilty of desertion the other day & sentenced him; & then discovered that the man did not exist. The Colonel says “I like well dressed young men—gentlemen” & gets rid of recruits who sink below this level. In addition to this, the demand for cavalry at the front is exhausted, so that probably they will stay at Colchester for ever. Another dark, rainy day. An aeroplane passed overhead."
1915.01.05,"I had a letter this morning from Nessa, who calls Mrs Waterlow a German hausfrau, & advises us not to pay a penny—Cleanliness is a fetish not to be worshipped, she says. Certainly, neither of us do worship it; I suppose Mrs W. ran about with a duster, & dabbed her finger under beds. I can imagine the list of discoveries she gave Sydney, sitting smoking over his philosophy, & how she cursed that dreadful slut Virginia Woolf. At the same time, it is a point of honour among servants to find the house they go into filthy, & to leave it bright as a pin. But enough of Waterlows & their slop pails. We worked as usual: as usual it rained. After lunch we took the air in the Old Deer Park, & marked by a line of straw how high the river had been; & how a great tree had fallen across the towing path, crushing the railing beneath it. Three bodies were seen yesterday swiftly coursing downstream at Teddington. Does the weather prompt suicide? The Times has a queer article upon a railway smash, in which it says that the war has taught us a proper sense of proportion with respect to human life. I have always thought we priced it absurdly high; but I never thought the Times would say so. L. went off to Hampstead to give the first of his lectures to the Women’s Guild. He did not seem nervous: he is speaking at this moment. We rather think that old Mr Davies is dying—but I have an idea he’ll resist for years to come, although he wants to die, & his life prevents Margaret from much work. I bought my fish & meat in the High Street—a degrading but rather amusing business. I dislike the sight of women shopping. They take it so seriously. Then I got a ticket in the Library, & saw all the shabby clerks & dressmakers thumbing illustrated papers, like very battered bees on very battered flowers. At least they are warm & dry: & it rains again today. The Belgians downstairs are playing cards with some friends, & talk—talk—talk—while their country is destroyed. After all, they have nothing else to do—"
1915.01.06,"The Waterlows again: Lily again. Mrs W. writes to Leonard this time, about the oven, & ends by being very much distressed to think we are annoyed—seeing how delightful they find Asheham. It is a queer thing that both the ladies in this correspondence write to both the gentlemen—feeling instinctively, I believe, that if they wrote to each other, the whole affair would become much more acid. Lily’s letter continues the story of the hidden soldier. It brings her very clearly before me, with her charming, stupid, doglike eyes, quite incapable of hurting a fly or thinking a coarse thought, & yet bound eternally to suffer for the sins of stronger characters. In this case, she was at the mercy of a parlourmaid, who invited the soldiers, & Lily had neither the strength of mind to be rude to them when they came, nor to ‘tell tales of a fellow servant’. ‘I would rather do anything than that’—& that, I imagine, was how she had her baby too. Anyhow, I have ‘spoken’ for her again, & she has promised to have no more to do with soldiers. L. went off at 10 a.m. to give his second lecture at Hampstead. The first was a great success, as I knew it would be. He finds the women much more intelligent than the men; in some ways too intelligent, & apt on that account, not to see the real point. He has another to give this afternoon, so he is staying up at Hampstead, lunching with Lilian, & perhaps seeing Janet. No one except a very modest person would treat these working women, & Lilian & Janet & Margaret, as he does. Clive, or indeed any other clever young man, would give himself airs; & however much he admired them pretend that he didn’t.

I wrote all the morning, with infinite pleasure, which is queer, because I know all the time that there is no reason to be pleased with what I write, & that in 6 weeks or even days, I shall hate it. Then I went to London, & asked at Grays Inn about Chambers. They had a set vacant; & I at once envisaged all sorts of charms, & let myself into them with a thrill of excitement. But they would be perfect for one, & impossible for two. There are 2 perfect rooms, looking over the gardens; & that is about all. Grays Inn Road thunders behind one. Next I saw a flat in Bedford Row, which promised divinely, but on asking at the agents, was told they had just been instructed to let it furnished only—And now, of course, I am convinced that there is no flat in London to equal it! I could wander about the dusky streets in Holborn & Bloomsbury for hours. The things one sees—& guesses at—the tumult & riot & busyness of it all—Crowded streets are the only places, too, that ever make me what-in-the-case of another-one-might-call think. Now I have to decide whether I shall go up again, to a party at Gordon Sqre, where the Aranyis are playing. On the one hand, I shirk the dressing & the journey; on the other I know that with the first chink of light in the hall & chatter of voices I should become intoxicated, & determine that life held nothing comparable to a party. I should see beautiful people, & get a sensation of being on the highest crest of the biggest wave—right in the centre & swim of things. On the third & final hand, the evenings reading by the fire here—reading Michelet & The Idiot, & smoking & talking to L. in what stands for slippers & dressing gown—are heavenly too. And as he won’t urge me to go, I know very well that I shant. Besides, there is vanity: I have no clothes to go in."
1915.01.07,"No—we didn’t go to the Gordon Sqre party. Leonard got back too late, & it rained; & really, we didn’t want to go. The lectures were a great success. One old lady told Leonard that they should consider him a personal friend for life; another said that he was the only gentleman who spoke so that working women could understand. He explained Bills of Exchange & so on for an hour; & then answered questions, which again, were amazingly intelligent. I started off after lunch today, first to go to the Foundling Hospital & ask whether they would let us have Brunswick Square—or half the house; then to the Omega to buy Janet a shawl, & then to tea with Janet. Mr Chubb opened the door to me at the Hospital. He was sitting at a writing table in a very warm comfortable room, looking on to the garden; while a clerk drew plans of houses on a very high desk. Mr Chubb is growing fat. He recognised me & became immediately extremely courteous. Brunswick Sqre is already practically let to a retired Ceylon Civil Servant, called Spence, who may however be willing to let the two upper floors, which would suit us very well. I became, of course, possessed with a passion to have Brunswick Square. Mr Chubb, who has infinite leisure, & likes conversation, discussed every possibility. He did not himself admire Adrian’s frescoes, but said that most people do. The Ceylon gentleman proposed to cover them with a curtain, being apparently of opinion that they were too good to destroy, though not nice to look upon. He is a bachelor, perhaps rather a crusty bachelor, once Chief of the Colombo Lunatic Asylum— At this point a Secretary came in, also excessively polite when he heard my name. “Mrs Woolf certainly has a very strong claim to the house” he said. “And I myself don’t think Spence is quite right”—“I do” Mr Chubb replied firmly “I’ve looked him up in the Medical Directory—besides, he seems all right.” “He looks all right certainly” the secretary agreed, “but I don’t know—However it wouldn’t be playing the game to refuse at the eleventh hour.” “The twelfth you may say” said Mr Chubb. At last I left, shaking hands all round, & having begged Mr Chubb to do his best & let us know. They advised me to see a house in Mecklenburgh Sqre, which I did. It is a vast place, with a great hall, a sweeping staircase; & we could have a flat at the top—the only objection being that Grays Inn Road is at the back—When I got out, it was raining. I walked to the Omega however & bought my stuff from a foolish young woman in a Post Impressionist tunic. I went to Hampstead, found some elderly lady there already, went to the station, in order to avoid tea with Emphie; & then was allowed up to Janet. She is in bed, & will have to stay in bed for weeks. Her nerves are thoroughly wrong. She can’t read, or do anything—I can guess what she feels like—& how miserable she must be very often—especially since she is growing old, & Emphie must be wearisome with her repetitions, & general enthusiastic vagueness. & then, the fag end of life—Still she is trained to be brave, & so unselfish by nature that other people really interest her. We talked about Leonard, & Lily, & life in London & Hardy’s poems which she can’t re-read—Too melancholy & sordid—& the subjects not interesting enough. I don’t agree. It grew late; & she suggested that I should dine there & go with L. to the Peace Debate at the Women’s Guild. I couldn’t face dinner, so I retreated to the Public Library. On the way I walked through one of the worst downpours I have ever been in. It was more like a shower bath than natural rain. My shoes squeaked so with wet as I walked up the Library that I was ashamed. Then I dined at a cabmans eating house—the only dining place, & very good. Coarse, but clean & sober. At 8 I met L. at 28 Church Row. The rooms are old white pannelled rooms; one was full of working women. It was a comfort (after reading more terrific letters of childbirth) to see how the women roar with laughter, like schoolgirls. Mr Hobson spoke—It was very good—The women impressive as usual—because they seem to feel, & to have such a sense of responsibility. Another letter from Mrs Waterlow.
"
1915.01.08,"Sydney Waterlow came to lunch with us today ‘to make sure’ as he put it ‘that we had not quarrelled over these wretched matters’. We discussed little else for the first hour & a half. My first letter had given him a sleepless night, he told us, though Mrs Waterlow in spite of pregnancy, slept sound. As far as we could make out, Mrs W. acts & writes impulsively; when Sydney bestirred himself to think, he was appalled to realise that their behaviour was not ethically sound. He cogitated for long, devoted a whole morning to his reply, & has taken the advice of several friends; who happen to agree with him that chimneys are usually swept by landlords. “But then we should have asked your leave—I entirely yield that point—only” & so on & so on; all in the solid simple style, which is so like him. His fat pink body always seems to me boneless & hairless like that of a gigantic child; & his mind is the same. But there is a charm about him. He & L. went for a walk. I went to Chancellors, to ask whether there was any news of Hogarth. At first the man said no. When I told him that we might take a house in London, he at once confessed that he had twice seen Mrs Wontner, the present tenant, & that she does not like the house. Is this invented, &, if not, is there some good reason why she does not like it? It seems likely that we shall have to choose between Brunswick & Hogarth—unless both fail us. Sydney came back to tea, & told us how Alice had been to see them, & how he had at once regretted her “as one might regret a very fine walking-stick—She was so pretty & happy with a great fat baby. The house was full of our furniture—like a house of death to me.” But when I suggested that the present Mrs W. had been uncomfortable he was amazed. “She isnt that sort of person at all” he said. “She’s perfectly sensible…..” Still, if she saw Sydney coveting the walking stick, I thought—Sydney replied that Marg. (as he calls her) was so infinitely more to him than the walking stick that she couldn’t feel anything of the kind. He went off to Asheham. They want to take it on for another 6 months—He has no work to do, but Asheham is so delightful that he is perfectly happy doing nothing."
1915.01.09,"At two o’clock this morning several barges moored in the river broke loose. One crashed into Richmond Bridge, & knocked off a good deal of stone from one of the arches—The others went to the bottom, or drifted down stream. All this I mention, not because we saw or heard anything of it, but because we noticed the damaged Bridge as we walked to Kingston this afternoon. The stone is yellower inside than out, which makes it more obvious. We had a very good walk. The purplish fields outside Kingston somehow reminded me of Saragossa. There is a foreign look about a town which stands up against the sunset, & is approached by a much trodden footpath across a field. I wonder why one instinctively feels that one is complimenting Kingston absurdly in saying that it is like a foreign town. On the towpath we met & had to pass a long line of imbeciles. The first was a very tall young man, just queer enough to look twice at, but no more; the second shuffled, & looked aside; & then one realised that every one in that long line was a miserable ineffective shuffling idiotic creature, with no forehead, or no chin, & an imbecile grin, or a wild suspicious stare. It was perfectly horrible. They should certainly be killed. We found a market going on at Kingston, as if it were Marlborough. We bought a pineapple for 9d. The man said they had all ripened on his hands, &, as he expected another boatload on Tuesday, he had to sell at a loss. We had a bad tea in a very pretentious place. We came back by train with a working man & two small boys. The working man began to tell us about the Lyons meat contract scandals; & told us that he was attached to the flying department at Hounslow. He was very clever, & should have been an M.P. or a journalist at least. I see Will Vaughan quoted in the Times to the effect that teachers neglect the grammar of modern languages, & talk too much about style & literature; but nothing fortifies the character & mind so much as grammar. How like him!
"
1915.01.10,"I was sitting typewriting this morning when there came a tap at the door; & someone whom I thought at first was Adrian, appeared: it was Walter Lamb however, fresh from the King. Whenever he has seen the King he comes to tell us. He insisted that we should go for a walk with him in Richmond Park. What did we talk about? We forgot about the King, & Walter told us a long inexpressibly dreary story which Professor Houseman had told him, about the inefficiency of the French soldiers. Whatever Walter says, has the same flat, smooth, grey surface; & his voice alone would dull the fieriest poesy in the world. Nor does he deal in fiery poems. His life now lies among respectable, semi-smart, rich people, whom he half despises, so that his accounts are always a little condescending. The one passion of his life is for eighteenth century building. All the time this morning he was bidding us admire a moulding or a window frame or even a ‘fan light’. He ‘sees over’ any house that is to let, apparently, & notices the internal decorations. He knows who now lives in big houses, & who once lived in them. He is perfectly suited by Kew, & the Royal Academy, & the Royal Family. On our doorstep he burst at length into an account of the last Royal visit, when the King, who now treats him as a friend (or rather, as Leonard say, like a superior footman) suddenly stopped admiring the pictures, & asked Princess Victoria where she gets her false teeth. “Mine, George exclaimed, are always dropping into my plate: they’ll be down my throat next. My man is a rascal. I’m going to leave him.” Victoria then gave a tug to her front teeth, & told him that they were as sound as could be—perfectly white & useful—The King then went back to the pictures. His style of talk reminds me of George 3rd in Fanny Burney’s diary—& so one must bless Walter for something— He refused to lunch with us, saying that he had lived on pheasants all the week, & rhubarb was forbidden him, on account of his acidity. It rains hard, all the afternoon, & now Marjorie Strachey who was to dine with us, cant come because of a cold. I beard last night from Mr Chubb that old Spence wont let any part of Brunswick Square—"
1915.01.11,"Leonard was in his bath this morning, & I was lying in bed, wondering whether I should stretch out my hand for Rob Roy, when I heard a commotion next door, & then someone rushed downstairs crying in a strange, unnatural voice “Fire! Fire!” As it was obvious that the house was not on fire, to any large extent, I put on my waterproof & slippers before I looked out of the window. I then smelt paper burning. I then went into the passage, & found smoke pouring from the open door of the next room. There was clearly time to escape, so I withdrew; & heard Lizzy return with the lodger; & heard her begin “I only put a bit of paper to draw the fire—” from which I guessed what had happened. “In ten minutes the room would have been ablaze” said the lodger. L. came back; & we looked out of our window, & saw a large Japanese screen, all in flames, burning on the grass plot. Later, I heard that the paper had caught; the draperies on the mantelpiece had caught; the screen had caught; the woodwork had caught. As every room in the house is lined with dry old wood, loosely papered over, 10 minutes I think, would have put the fire beyond water jugs—The lodger was in terror, too, for his priceless rugs: ‘worth hundreds & hundreds’ according to Mrs Le Grys. The wonder is how we have escaped so far, considering Lizzy. Yesterday she smashed two very nice bits of china for us.

We went up to London this afternoon: L. to see the editor of the New Statesman about an article on Diplomacy—I to go over a flat in Mecklenburgh Square. We met unexpectedly in M. Sqre. When we reached the house, however, the occupier refused to let us see it. So we had to apply to the owner, who lives a few doors off. We were shown into a beautiful room, which was disfigured horribly with velvet curtains, gigantic purple cushions, & the usual swarm of gilt & lemon coloured objects. The woman herself sat in an invalid chair, arranged, like a childs high chair, with a bar across it. Her hair (a flaxen wig) was plastered on either side of her head, & she had the usual powdered plump rouged look of Bloomsbury ladies. This always makes us both physically uncomfortable. She was very sensible however, a business woman, I suppose, owning several houses, & running them, I’m sure, at a profit. She made us see over her house, instead of the other one. We were taken over by a small, wizened, very amiable old lady, who had disfigured her part of the house until it was scarcely recognisable—The drawing room, in particular, where she had lavished her skill, made your eyes start with its innumerable, discordant, hideous small things—two clusters of flags displayed on the tables chiefly impressed me. There were all the flags of all the nations, I should think; all the photographs of all the royal families. It was like looking into a kaleidoscope, because of the innumerable separate dots of colour—& yet they weren’t colour. I went on to Days Library & L. to the London Library. He has to write an article of 1200 words by Wednesday noon, on Diplomatists—A wonderful subject anyhow.

"
1915.01.12,"Today did not begin with a fire. Leonard however had to take Mrs Le Grys to task for Lizzie’s sins. The poor woman could only agree. Since she knows she is going, she doesn’t mind how many plates she breaks—if she would only go. Mrs Le G. finds it impossible to get a servant; she pays them only £16 a year however.

Cecil came to luncheon, in mufti, I observed. In fact they are both entirely sick of the army, & see no chance of going to the front. Nevertheless, Cecil thinks of being a permanent soldier, because the life is better than a Barrister’s life. On the other hand, he & Philip may go to the colonies. The odd thing about the Woolf family, to me, is the extreme laxness of it. In my family, the discussions & agitations that went on about the slightest change in one’s way of life were endless; but with the W.’s it doesn’t much seem to matter whether they turn farmer, run away with another man’s wife, or marry a Polish Jew Tailors daughter. I remember how elaborately Aunt Mary concealed the feet that Hervey’s young woman was a kind of shopkeeper, & how indefatigable she was until the engagement was broken off. Perhaps the W.’s haven’t a family tradition. It gives a sense of freedom anyhow. From all this, obviously I have nothing to say. L. & Cecil walked to Kingston after lunch; I pottered about buying small fragments of meat & vegetables, & got some books out of the Library. I believe we shall find it more useful than the London Library, as no one, save ourselves, reads solid books. L. is now writing his article upon diplomacy, & I must go & typewrite. An entire fine day for a wonder."
1915.01.13,"I caused some slight argument (with L.) this morning by trying to cook my breakfast in bed. I believe, however, that the good sense of the proceeding will make it prevail; that is, if I can dispose of the eggshells. L. went off to the New Statesman office this morning with his article. I lunched here, & then went to Days, to get more books. Days at 4 in the afternoon is the haunt of fashionable ladies, who want to be told what to read. A more despicable set of creatures I never saw. They come in furred like seals & scented like civets, condescend to pull a few novels about on the counter, & then demand languidly whether there is anything amusing? The Days’ assistants are the humblest & most servile of men—They tow these aged Countesses & pert young millionairesses about behind them. always deferential, & profuse of “Ladyships”. The West End of London fills me with aversion; I look into motor cars & see the fat grandees in side, like portly jewels in satin cases. The afternoons now have an elongated pallid look, as if it were neither winter nor spring. I came back to tea. L. arrived—having seen Gordon Sqre & Maynard (who says German finance is crumbling) & Saxon, who is recovering from Influenza. He had a headache, so, instead of going to the Co-op. meeting, we are staying at home."
1915.01.14,"We were woken this morning (I see this is going to become a stock phrase like ‘Once upon a Time’ in a Faery story) by a thumping throbbing sound as if a motor omnibus were on the roof, endeavouring to start. Experience told now, however, that Lizzy had merely made a huge kitchen fire, when there was no water in the pipes. When L. turned on the tap, steam issued, as if it were Siegfried’s dragon at Covent Garden, & then came floating bits of pipe, & the water was rust red—Nobody, however, seemed to think that the boiler might burst. We wrote all the morning. I heard from Adrian, by the way, who has gone into rooms in Cambridge without a single sheet. Now, I begin telephoning & writing about sheets, just as the Waterlows are silent. After lunch, we set off to Kingston in order to buy some charming cups, which are to be had there for 1d each. If Lizzie doesn’t go, & continues to behave as though each day were her last, we must give her something cheap to break her rage against. We came home on the top of a bus; making up phrases in the manner & tone of Walter Lamb. Leonard is going up to hear the Fabians discourse; I think I shall indulge in a picture palace—but why? I shall certainly come out saying to myself, “Nothing will induce me ever to go to a picture palace again”. I also heard from Annie, who evidently intends to be our permanent cook, for the excellent reason, I think, that ours is the easiest place in England. The Waterlows say that her young man has removed to—or been replaced by one—at Willesden. L’s article on diplomacy is to come out on Saturday. He was, of course, convinced after sending it that it would be rejected (this is a note, for future use & quotation)."
1915.01.15,"I went to my picture palace; & L. to his Fabians; & he thought, on the whole, that his mind & spirit & body would have profited more by the pictures than by the Webbs, & the doctors, who were talking about their etiquette. There were 2 or 3 superb pictures; one of a barge laden with timber floating past Bagdad—another of an eastern palace, overrun with apes & pariah dogs—another of a sunken yatcht. But as usual, the drama is very boring. I wish one liked what everyone likes. The Hall was crowded, roars of laughter, applause & c.

I heard from Emphie Case this morning, who wishes me to find out about the Home at Lewes where Lily had her child—as she knows a young woman who also wants to have a child. I wonder how Emphie comes across these things. Janet much the same.

We walked to Hogarth this afternoon, to see if the noise of schoolchildren is really a drawback. Apparently, it would only affect Suffield. Well—I wonder what we shall do. I’d give a lot to turn over 30 pages or so, & find written down what happens to us. We walked into the Park, & saw Territorials flogging & spurring their carthorses; also a great fallen tree. We are dining early, & going to a Hall—an unheard of dissipation—though there was a time when I went out to operas, evenings concerts &c, at least 3 times a week—And I know we shall both feel, when its over, ‘really a good read would have been better’. L. continues to read diplomatists; I read about 1860—the Kembles—Tennyson & so on; to get the spirit of that time, for the sake of The Third Generation. They were immensely scientific—always digging up extinct monsters, & looking at the stars, & trying to find a Religion. At this moment, I feel as if the human race had no character at all—sought for nothing, believed in nothing, & fought only from a dreary sense of duty.

I began today to treat my corn. It had to be done for a week."
1915.01.16,"I think the Hall (Coliseum) last night was worth while—in spite of draw backs.What I like in Halls are ‘turns’—comic singers, or men imitating Prima Donna’s, or Jugglers. I don’t like one act plays. It takes me a whole act to get into a play, & so one act plays are mostly sheer boredom. Therefore I was disappointed to have 3 one act plays; one the Barrie Der Tag—sheer balderdash of the thinnest kind about the German Emperor; then a play about a woman who means Parrot when she says Pirate; third Dr Johnson. To begin with Johnson spits bread & butter through his nose to end with he is paternal, sentimental & as tender as a woman—which is of course what he was bound to be on the stage. However, there was a man who sang like a Prima Donna; & a patriotic Revue—people clapped Grey more than anyone. We left, just as an Eastern jar, coloured grey & violet, shot up in the middle of the stage;—& I didn’t see my war pictures, but departed mildly as a lamb.

We wrote this morning. L’s article by the way reads very well in the New Statesman. I had a request from Adrian for silver, glass, kitchen things. They seem to have set up house without a single article. He wrote by a candle light, stuck in a saucer. L. went to the L. Library; I took Max along the River, but we were a good deal impeded, by a bone he stole, by my suspenders coming down, by a dogfight in which his ear was torn & bled horribly. I thought how happy I was, without any of the excitements which, once, seemed to me to constitute happiness. L. & I argued for some time about this. Also about the worthlessness of all human works except as a means of keeping the workers happy. My writing now delights me solely because I love writing & dont, honestly, care a hang what anyone says. What seas of horror one dives through in order to pick up these pearls—however they are worth it."
1915.01.17,"The morning was unremarkable—in the afternoon, Herbert came & took L. for a walk. I went to a Queens Hall Concert, stayed for three beautiful tunes, & came back, to find Herbert who stayed on till dinnertime. M⁠[arjorie]. S⁠[trachey]. came to dinner; changed, somehow, at the first glance. Improved, I thought, though noticeably thinner. She complained of sleeplessness, & in the usual S. way of ‘being shattered’; & life being ‘too fearful’. But she talked of ordinary things until after dinner she began to harp very markedly on marriage—(I should say that for no reason at all, she said to us “I’ve a friend who thinks me rather beautiful, & very stupid”—& half suspecting something odd, I said “O he’s a working man, & you mustn’t marry him). Well, she pressed us more & more with questions about married life, & whether she should marry, & how she wanted to marry; & sometimes I thought she was only talking as so many unmarried people do, & sometimes I suspected there was more. At last one of us (I, perhaps) said “Well but Marjorie, what d’you want to be?” “A married woman” she answered tragically. “But is there someone you want to marry?” “Yes!” “Does he want to marry you?”. “Yes!!”—“Who is he?” She buried her face in her hands, & then exclaimed “A married man! Jos Wedgwood!” We both gasped, in silence. And then we discussed nothing else for an hour or two. It is about the oddest business I ever heard of—this being more or less what has happened. Last summer, Jos left his wife, or she left him, this point being doubtful. Since that, he has lived alone in London, & complained bitterly to Philip Morrell among others of his loneliness. Philip recommended a prostitute. Ottoline thereupon procured Marjorie. They asked her to dinner, & after dinner, Ottoline danced behind the folding doors, & left Marjorie to a tremendous tete a tete with Jos. Although this was their first meeting, he told her his history & his sorrows. Next day he called on Lady Strachey. They met constantly, &, a week or so before Xmas he proposed to her at Lockeridge. By this time she was much in love & accepted him—but what are they to do? She refuses to let him get a Divorce, on the ground that a divorce is ignominious; he, moreover, says that a Divorce would ruin him politically. He is tremendously ambitious. She wishes to live with him as his wife; but this of course means utter political ruin again. To be an ordinary mistress is out of the question for her. Lady Strachey again complicates the question, because she would be horrified at any unconventionality, & cannot be told of it. Then there is the fear of Mrs Wedgwood. If she hears, will she try to get Jos back? Will she succeed? Half of the Stracheys (Lytton among them) advise M. to think no more of it. She is obviously in love; & also quite distracted & worn out. She is going to the South of France; Jos meanwhile is going to the Front. Well—what can one make of it all? Seeing M. in love, & her love returned, I felt that the only course was the extreme one; but when I reflected, particularly upon the way in which the thing has happened, the shortness of it, & Ottoline’s manoeuvres, I had doubts—about Jos, mostly. Isn’t it a case of Sydney Waterlow over again? Will his feeling last, even if hers does? He was married for 20 years to Ethel, & they have 7 children. Leonard is pessimistic, & right, I expect. He thinks that M. is going the worst way for her own prospects, & points out the horror of her position as a mistress, without any tie upon a man who admittedly cares more for his career than anything, & has been supplied with her to gratify wants which may quickly pass—But for some time now they will be apart, & so things may settle themselves. For her, I feel it is the great affair of her life, one way or the other. This morning, obeying a nocturnal command, I wrote to Thomas Hardy! thanking him for his poem about Father, & his works!
"
1915.01.18,"We were still a good deal under the influence of Marjorie this morning. All night (it seemed) people were banging boxes next door. The lodger has got a wife back from New York. This afternoon we went over the houses in Mecklenburgh Sqre; which has led to a long discussion about our future, & a fresh computation of income. The future is dark, which is on the whole, the best thing the future can be, I think. L. went to the Webbs, & I came home—nor has anything happened since to be worth putting down save that, as I began this page, L. stated that he had determined to resign his commission to write a pamphlet about Arbitration—& now I shall stop this diary & discuss that piece of folly with him. It is partly due to my egoistical habit of always talking the argument of my book. I want to see what can be said against all forms of activity & thus dissuade L. from all his work, speaking really not in my own character but in Effie’s. Of course it is absolutely essential that L. shd. do a work which may be superbly good.
"
1915.01.19,"L’s melancholy continues, so much so that he declared this morning he couldn’t work. The consequence has been rather a melancholy day. Outside it is very cold & grey too. We walked in Richmond Park this afternoon; the trees all black, & the sky heavy over London; but there is enough colour to make it even lovelier today than on bright days, I think. The deer exactly match the bracken. But L. was melancholy, as I say. All I can do is to unsay all I have said; & to say what I really mean. Its a bad habit writing novels—it falsifies life, I think. However, after praising L’s writing very sincerely for 5 minutes, he says “Stop”; whereupon I stop, & theres no more to be said. When I analyse his mood, I attribute much of it to sheer lack of self confidence in his power of writing; as if he mightn’t be a writer, after all; & being a practical man, his melancholy sinks far deeper than the half assumed melancholy of self conscious people like Lytton, & Sir Leslie & myself. There’s no arguing with him.

Well, I’m reading The Idiot. I cant bear the style of it very often; at the same time, he seems to me to have the same kind of vitality in him that Scott had; only Scott merely made superb ordinary people, & D. creates wonders, with very subtle brains, & fearful sufferings. Perhaps the likeness to Scott partly consists in the loose, free & easy, style of the translation. I am also reading Michelet, plodding through the dreary middle ages; & Fanny Kemble’s Life. Yesterday in the train I read The Rape of the Lock, which seems to me “supreme”—almost superhuman in its beauty & brilliancy—you really can’t believe that such things are written down. I think one day I shall write a book of “Eccentrics”. Mr Grote shall be one. Lady Hester Stanhope. Margaret Fuller. Duchess of Newcastle. Aunt Julia?
"
1915.01.20,"Having finished a chapter, I went off buying small fragments of things part of the morning—For one thing, I saw a mass of pinkish stuff in the fishmongers, & bought it—Cods’ Roe. Then I made carbon copies of some notes of L’s about Arbitration. The action of nature has relieved his spirits more than all the arguments of his wife—also the day was fine. Anyhow one may now hope he will get started, which is the main thing. He went to the School of Economics after lunch; & I to Westminster. I want to see as many houses as possible. But in Barton St. the rent is £130—& that is low, on account of the war. Westminster, noiseless & shadowed by the Abbey is almost the heart of London.

By this time it was raining. I went to Days, & found my books already sent. When I tried to remember the name of one, I failed utterly; so one must feel in an examination. I read Essay upon Criticism waiting for my train at Hammersmith. The classics make the time pass much better than the Pall Mall Gazette. Maynard Keynes came to dinner. We gave him oysters. He is like quicksilver on a sloping board—a little inhuman, but very kindly, as inhuman people are. We gossiped at full speed about Adrian & Karin (Adrian’s lovemaking done in loud judicious tones) & of course Marjorie & Jos. Here, though friendly & very amusing, I thought K. a little inhuman. He saw the queerness & the fun, but didn’t seem to see that it might be serious. Nessa & Ottoline, he says, contrived the whole thing. Then we talked about the war. We aren’t fighting now, he says, but only waiting for the spring. Meantime we lavish money, on a scale which makes the French, who are fearfully out at elbow, gape with admiration. We are bound to win—& in great style too, having at the last moment applied all our brains & all our wealth to the problem.
"
1915.01.21,"Maynard last night was sceptical about the value of writing on Arbitration. He was sceptical about the value of almost all work, save for the pleasure it gives the worker. He works only because he likes it. This of course, depressed poor L. once more. He was very melancholy this morning, & had to spend the day at the British Museum, which was bad enough, even if one believed in one’s drudgery. Still I believe it will be an enormous success, &, if it doesn’t prevent another war, it will put him among the eminent young men, which isn’t altogether despicable. I went to the London Library—a stale culture smoked place, which I detest. Here I read Gilbert Murray on Immortality, got a book for L. & so home, missing my train, & reading the Letter to Dr Arbuthnot on Hammersmith Station. L. came in late, having been up to Hampstead & seen Janet, who seems still the same; but so I think it must be, for months. Emphie annoyed with Margaret, who advises a proper rest cure “which one doesn’t do to the patient herself.” Sylvia Milman came to dinner—After a good deal of bowing & scraping about China (which she has dutifully seen, in her endeavour to be advanced) we got on to memories of childhood which amused me, but bored L. I’m afraid. No one ever had a duller home than she had; but by sheer hard work, without a scrap of talent, she has plodded after the Advanced i.e. Nessa, until she lives in a flat, saves money to travel, & helps at the Omega. Ida is nursing in France; Enid & Maud have a chicken farm. Clearly there was good stuff in the Dean; though never a spark of enthusiasm. She stayed on & on, until L. half rose from his chair.
"
1915.01.22,"When L. pulled the curtains this morning, practically no light came in; there was a kind of greyish confusion outside—soft swirling incessant snow. This has gone on all day almost, sometimes changing to rain. The Green itself is very lovely; & lights up the room with its pure white glare. But the streets became brown directly. Of course, in this House of Trouble, the pipes burst; or got choked; or the roof split asunder. Anyhow in the middle of the morning, I heard a steady rush of water in the wainscoat; & Mr Le Grys, Lizzie & various people have been clambering about the roof ever since. The water still drips through the ceiling into a row of slop pails. Mrs Le Grys cries hysterically “O it’ll be all right—you’re insured”. The plumber refuses to leave his house in weather like this. We are going to hear the Fabians at Essex Hall. I daresay we shall be swept out of our beds tonight. Its a queer winter—the worst I ever knew, & suitable for the war & all the rest of it. I never said yesterday that I heard from Thomas Hardy! He wrote a very nice, very characteristic letter, & was much pleased that I wrote. So that my nocturnal impulse was from God.
"
1915.01.23,"The Fabians were well worth hearing: still more worth seeing. Miss Atkinson drivelled at length about Peace—I could understand, always, & confute generally, all that she said; so that I think it must have been very bad. The interest was watching Mrs Webb, seated like an industrious spider at the table; spinning her webs (a pun!—) incessantly. The hall was full of earnest drab women, who are thought ‘queer’ at home, & rejoice in it; & of broad nosed, sallow, shock headed young men, in brown tweed suits. They all looked unhealthy & singular & impotent. The only speech that was worth anything came from Squire, who wears a bright blue shirt & cultivates an amusing appearance. He said it was all very dull & sensible—which it was; & the idea that these frail webspinners can affect the destiny of nations seems to me fantastic. But it was well worth going,—& I have now declared myself a Fabian. We stayed in Richmond all day. We walked up the river, & were startled by the sudden fall of an avalanche of snow from a roof. It was very cold & misty. Jean asked us to go & hear some V.A.D.’s sing; but the fire after tea was too tempting. Oliver & Ray dined with us. Oliver as usual, very prompt impatient & rather testy. Ray solid & capable & soothing. We discussed the war, & Marjorie. “I cant bear to think of it. Its too revolting” O. shuddered, after saying that M. must of course live with Jos. as his mistress. Ray says she divides the world into those who are nice enough to be in love with, & those who aren’t—& Marjorie is’nt. They think her in love—but in love too with the drama of the situation. They share our fears too—but agree that anything in her case is better than nothing.
"
1915.01.24,"In the middle of dinner last night, Molly rang us up to ask whether she & Desmond might come to lunch today. Oliver exclaimed that Desmond as he happened to know, had promised to lunch with Henry James. We told Molly this. It was news to her. So she came alone, about 12.30. We plunged of course into Gordon Square gossip. She has suffered acutely this winter, owing to a series of embroilments with Clive, the nature of which I can imagine; though whether he got bored first or she disgusted, I don’t know. Anyhow, as I could have foretold, after violent scenes lasting almost 18 months, they have parted, & he abuses her, & she abuses herself—for ever having listened. But she finds that an intermittent acquaintance wont do for him—‘garden party talk’ he calls it; & she feels that intimacy in those circles leads to a kind of dustiness of soul. So she has broken, & now takes Desmond off to Freshwater for 9 months, to live cheaply & write a novel. This is the very last attempt—& it sounds a little desperate. He is to come up to town once in 6 weeks. She is to manage 3 children & the house with only one servant. And she means never again to come back into the whirl. Moreover they have quarrelled with his Mother, & forfeited £100 a year; so they must live on £350, which includes Desmond’s weekly article in the New Statesman. She was incoherent, inattentive, & fragmentary as usual; like a little grey moth among machines. L. went to see his mother; I called on Jean, whom I found sitting in black velvet in a room like a cheap restaurant with brilliant lights. And there was old Mrs Thomas too, knitting incessantly: & we talked about waterpipes & soldiers; & so home, to a quiet evening thank God.
"
1915.01.25,"My birthday—& let me count up all the things I had. L. had sworn he would give me nothing, & like a good wife, I believed him. But he crept into my bed, with a little parcel, which was a beautiful green purse. And he brought up breakfast, with a paper which announced a naval victory (we have sunk a German battle ship) & a square brown parcel, with The Abbot in it—a lovely first edition— So I had a very merry & pleasing morning—which indeed was only surpassed by the afternoon. I was then taken up to town, free of charge, & given a treat, first at a Picture Palace, & then at Buszards. I don’t think I’ve had a birthday treat for 10 years; & it felt like one too—being a fine frosty day, everything brisk & cheerful, as it should be, but never is. The Picture Palace was a little disappointing—as we never got to the War pictures, after waiting 1 hour & a half. But to make up, we exactly caught a non-stop train, & I have been very happy reading father on Pope, which is very witty & bright—without a single dead sentence in it. In fact I dont know when I have enjoyed a birthday so much—not since I was a child anyhow. Sitting at tea we decided three things: in the first place to take Hogarth, if we can get it; in the second, to buy a Printing press; in the third to buy a Bull dog, probably called John. I am very much excited at the idea of all three—particularly the press. I was also given a packet of sweets to bring home.
"
1915.01.26,"L. went up to the School of Economics this morning: I wrote, as usual over the fire, with an occasional interruption by Lizzy, who is like a rough coated young carthorse, with muddy hoofs. After lunch, I met L. at the gates of Kew Gardens, & we walked back to Richmond through the Gardens, which are now one feels teeming with buds & bulbs, though not a spike shows. He has already grasped his Arbitration—such is the male mind—& will, I see, go through with it straight off & (here I make my prophesy) it will be a great success, & lead to as much work as he wants. As Molly sighed ‘It must be wonderful to have a husband who works!’ I think it would be much odder to have one who didn’t—Mrs Woolf & Clara are coming to dinner, so I must stop.
"
1915.01.27,"Mrs Woolf & Clara came to dinner. I dont know what it is about them—I daresay I’d better not try to define it. Perhaps their voices partly?—partly their manners. Anyhow, they gave us flowers & chocolates. Mrs W. sat & knitted. Clara smoked. I think Jewesses are somehow discontented. Clara is. Mrs W. has the mind of a child. She is amused by everything, & yet understands nothing—says whatever comes into her head—prattles incessantly, now good humoured, now ill humoured. She seems to like everyone equally, as if they were all the same. She told us how she used to go to bed with a basket of socks by her side, so as to start darning first thing in the morning.

Leonard went up to the School of Economics today. I wrote, & then went to Janet. Emphie & the cook have influenza—I was met by an elder sister—a shrewd, sensible elderly woman, who has taken charge of things. Janet seemed better, & said she was better. We talked about my novel (which everyone, so I predict will assure me is the most brilliant thing they’ve ever read; & privately condemn, as indeed it deserves to be condemned.) & about Shelley, & Poets & their immorality. She said that in her young days she would have disapproved of Shelley’s relations with women—But the old sister dodged in & out, which made conversation about morality uneasy. Home & finished Pope, & so to bed.

"
1915.01.28,"Leonard off again to lunch with the Webbs, & have his Committee meeting. Once more I wrote. All these days, I may remark, are semidark, lightening a little about 3 p.m. before their final plunge into darkness; & yet I think even this darkness is the darkness of very early spring, not winter darkness any more. I decided to go to London, for the sake of hearing the Strand roar, which I think one does want, after a day or two of Richmond. Somehow, one can’t take Richmond seriously. One has always come here for an outing, I suppose; & that is part of its charm, but one wants serious life sometimes. As I dressed, my watch fell on the floor; & sitting at tea in a shop in the Strand, I found that the hands pointed to 4.30 still, though it went on ticking. So I took it to Frodsham’s, in South Molton Street, where I made great play with the name of McCabe, & the fact that the watch had been over 60 years in my family. Frodsham claims to be the only genuine watchmaker in London: the rest are jewellers. I saw a beautiful woman in the Bus; who could hardly contain her laughter because a great military gentleman was thrown on to her lap, like a sack of coals, which seemed to tickle her greatly, & the more she laughed, the nicer I thought her. About one person in a fortnight seems to me nice—most are nothing at all. Home to find L. triumphant from his Committee meeting. He is to do as he likes: & Squire throws out hints that they would like him to edit the Blue book supplement for them. Well ‘I told you so’—A new servant has come today. Lizzy left, carrying a brown paper parcel & whistling loudly—I wonder where she has gone?
"
1915.01.29,"Shall I say “nothing happened today” as we used to do in our diaries, when they were beginning to die? It wouldn’t be true. The day is rather like a leafless tree: there are all sorts of colours in it, if you look closely. But the outline is bare enough. We worked: after lunch we walked down the river, to that great mediaeval building which juts out into the river—It is I think a vast mill. And we came back early, so that L. might have tea before he went to a Committee at Hampstead. After that I bought our food, & did not observe much of interest. But the fact of the day for me has been a vague kind of discomfort, caused by the eccentric character of the new servant Maud. When one speaks to her, she stops dead & looks at the ceiling. She bursts into the room ‘just to see if you are there’. She is an angular woman of about 40, who never stays long in any place. I believe she lives in dread of something. She puts down plates with a start. Mrs Le Grys says that she herself is going mad, with Maud’s peculiarities. She has just announced that she is the daughter of a Colonel. I am sure her brain is full of illusions, poor creature; & I shouldn’t be surprised at anything. The only question is, how she contrives to exist."
1915.01.30,"L. went to Chancellors this morning about Hogarth. They now volunteer that Mrs Wontner wishes to stay on—but will let us know on Monday for certain. It is a great nuisance. I have a nose for a house, & that was a perfect house, if ever there was one. We went to Wimbledon this afternoon, on the strength of Savages information that there was a beautiful house there to let. Wimbledon is a dreary, high, bleak, windy suburb, on the edge of a threadbare heath. And Savage’s house is an enlarged villa, with a rent of £150, furnished, overlooked by motor omnibuses, standing on the road. In all ways therefore utterly unsuited to us. We came home by Bus; & the world grew steadily nicer as we came to Richmond. Certainly it is the first of the suburbs by a long way, because it is not an offshoot of London, any more than Oxford or Marlborough is. It was icy cold; I had the grace to remember that many bus conductors are shivering today, but only stabs at my own comfort make me remember other people—unlike L. Maud’s secret obsession, I believe, is that she is a lady. She attempts genteel talk, about the weather, as a Colonel’s daughter very well might, & mutters something when she brings in the coal, about being accustomed to private work. She is certainly cleaner than Lizzie. I hope her mania wont develop. My corn is cured. I cannot get on with Michelet’s middle ages. L. has Indian Blue Books to review. He was kept late at Hampstead: didnt get home till 10.15. when we had hot chocolate over the fire. He read Janet ‘The Three Jews’."
1915.01.31,"O dear! We quarrelled almost all the morning! & it was a lovely morning, & now gone to Hades for ever, branded with the marks of our ill humour. Which began it? Which carried it on? God knows. This I will say: I explode: & L. smoulders. However, quite suddenly we made it up, (but the morning was wasted) & we walked after lunch in the Park, & came home by way of Hogarth, & tried to say that we shan’t be much disappointed if we don’t get it. Anyhow, it hasn’t got the Green in front of it. After tea, as no one came (we’ve hardly seen anyone this week) I started reading The Wise Virgins, & I read it straight on till bedtime, when I finished it. My opinion is that its a remarkable book; very bad in parts; first rate in others. A writer’s book, I think, because only a writer perhaps can see why the good parts are so very good, & why the very bad parts aren’t very bad. It seems to me to have the stuff of 20 Duke Jones’ in it, although there are howlers which wd. make Miss Sidgwick turn grey. I was made very happy by reading this: I like the poetic side of L. & it gets a little smothered in Blue-books, & organisations."
1915.02.01,"I had to go out shopping this morning, so I called in on Chancellors. They say that Mrs Wontner makes conditions about taking on Hogarth, so that ‘it is possible that she won’t take it—So here we are on the seesaw again. Mrs Le Grys, also, told me this morning of a house on the Green, 3 doors off, which is to let in March. The rent is £65 & they want £75 premium. We went to look at it after luncheon, but, being a boarding house, couldn’t see over it. What we saw was defaced in every possible way; but a nice substantial house, without the charms of Hogarth, but then with the addition of the Green. We went up to London—L. to the London Library: I to Days. I walked with him across the Green Park. In St James Street there was a terrific explosion; people came running out of Clubs; stopped still & gazed about them. But there was no Zeppelin or aeroplane—only, I suppose, a very large tyre burst. But it is really an instinct with me, & most people, I suppose, to turn any sudden noise, or dark object in the sky into an explosion, or a German aeroplane. And it always seems utterly impossible that one should be hurt.

I was annoyed in the usual way at Days by the afternoon party of fashionable ladies, looking for books. We have just been rung up by Chancellors, who wish us to see the owner of Hogarth tomorrow, & possibly by our presence & respectability outwit Mrs Wontner, whose demands have annoyed Chancellors. In fact it seems quite likely at this moment that we shall get Hogarth! I wish it were tomorrow. I am certain it is the best house to take.
"
1915.02.02,"Well, it is tomorrow; & we are certainly nearer to Hogarth than we were. We have done little else & thought of little else all day, so it is as well we have some profit—"
1915.02.13,"There was a great downpour this morning. I am sure however many years I keep this diary, I shall never find a winter to beat this. It seems to have lost all self control. We wrote; & after luncheon L. went to the Library, & I went to a concert at the Queen’s Hall. I ran into Oliver Strachey, standing very like a Strachey in the Hall, because he dislikes sitting inside waiting for the music. I got by luck a very good place, for the Hall was nearly full—& it was a divine concert. But one of the things I decided as I listen⁠[ed] (its difficult not to think of other things) was that all descriptions of music are quite worthless, & rather unpleasant; they are apt to be hysterical, & to say things that people will be ashamed of having said afterwards. They played Haydn, Mozart no 8, Brandenburg Concerto, & the Unfinished. I daresay the playing wasnt very good, but the stream of melody was divine. It struck me what an odd thing it was—this little box of pure beauty set down in the middle of London streets, & people—all looking so ordinary, crowding to hear, as if they weren’t ordinary after all, or had an ambition for something better. Opposite me was Bernard Shaw, grown a whitehaired benevolent old man, & down in the orchestra was Walter Lamb, shining in his alabastrine baldness like a marble fountain. I was annoyed by a young man & woman next me who took advantage of the music to press each other’s hands; & read ‘A Shropshire Lad’ & look at some vile illustrations. And other people eat chocolates, & crumbled the silver paper into balls. I went to the W.C. at the Tube station, & found a small party going on in that chaste recess. The old woman had a vast female dog which was drinking water out of a tumbler, & her daughters were paying an afternoon call, & we were all very friendly, in odd surroundings—I thought it very sensible to have no false shame. I met L. at Spikings & we had tea, & were very happy; & stopped at Earls Court & called on his mother, but she was out. We were shown into a huge high sitting room, in which was a minute old lady, in semi darkness, sitting on the edge of a sofa. Nothing could have been more forlorn. L. has now got another book of Indian travels from the Times. He had just made up his mind that he was dismissed.
"
1915.02.14,"Rain again today. I cleaned silver, which is an easy & profitable thing to do. It so soon shines again. Philip came, & he and L. went for a walk. He lunched with us & stayed talking till 3.30. They despair more than ever now of getting to the front. All Regular officers are preferred above them. Cecil has a machine gun, which may lead to his going, &, if so, almost certainly to his being killed. Poor Philip was a good deal agitated, I thought, with his prospects. What is he to do after the war is over? He thinks he must emigrate. Cecil would like to stay on in the Army, which however, one can’t do, unless one has money, & neither of them has a penny. Five hundred a year is considerably more valuable than beauty or rank. He stayed talking, wanting to talk about himself perhaps & had to go back to Colchester, where the only tolerable thing is the oysters. The men he declares never cease joking; & the worse things are the more they joke. Then we walked down the river, in the face of a cold gale (which is now raging outside) & gladly came home to tea; & now sit as usual surrounded by books & paper & ink, & so shall sit till bedtime—save that I have some mending to do, my entire skirt having split in two yesterday. L. is writing a review of his Indian book. I am now reading a later volume of Michelet, which is superb, & the only tolerable history. The people next door are singing the same song that they’ve been practising these 3 months—a hymn. From all this, it is clear that I don’t want to mend my dress: & have nothing whatever to say."
1915.02.15,"There is nothing to record of this morning, except my conviction that Mrs Le Grys is the best tempered woman in England, &, if she gets her 20 roomed house at Southampton, will make it a gigantic success. We have only to hint that we want dog soap, & she washes Max (who badly wanted it).

We both went up to London this afternoon; L. to the Library, & I to ramble about the West End, picking up clothes. I am really in rags. It is very amusing. With age too one’s less afraid of the superb shop women. These great shops are like fairies’ palaces now. I swept about in Debenham’s & Marshalls & so on, buying, as I thought with great discretion. The shop women are often very charming, in spite of their serpentine coils of black hair. (By the way, I met Walter Lamb at Dover Street station—A gentleman in frock coat, top hat, slip, umbrella &c. accosted me. I fairly laughed. It was old Wat. who had just been lunching with an M.P’s wife, & seeing all the grandees. His satisfaction is amazing: it oozes out everywhere.) Then I had tea, & rambled down to Charing Cross in the dark, making up phrases & incidents to write about. Which is, I expect, the way one gets killed.

L. went to tea at Gordon Sqre where he saw Mrs Hutchinson, who is the present flame, but a very smoky one. Clive anyhow approves our scheme of a Periodical, & he is a man of business, whatever he may be as an artist.

I bought a ten & elevenpenny blue dress, in which I sit at this moment."
1917.08.03,"Came to Asheham. Walked out from Lewes. Stopped raining for the first time since Sunday. Men mending the wall & roof at Asheham. Will has dug up the bed in front, leaving only one dahlia. Bees in attic chim⁠[n]⁠ey."
1917.08.04,"Rained all the morning very hard. Newspapers sent on to Telscombe, but signalman lent us the Daily News. To post at Southease in the afternoon. Back over the downs. Very wet. Corn beaten down by rain. L. made book cases."
1917.08.05,"Dull morning, getting steadily finer, until it became a very hot & sunny afternoon. Walked on M.’s walk. Saw 3 perfect peacock butterflies, 1 silver washed frit⁠[illary]; besides innumerable blues feeding on dung. All freshly out & swarming on the hill. Small flowers out in great quantities. Found mushrooms, mostly in the hollow, enough for a dish. Barbara & Bunny after dinner stayed for tea & dinner."
1917.08.06,"Very fine hot day. (Bank Holiday). Sound of band in Lewes from the Downs. Guns heard at intervals. Walked up the down at the back. Got 6th Aug. 1918 eggs 4/6 doz. plenty of mushrooms. Butterflies in quantities. Ladies Bedstraw, Round-headed Rampion, Thyme, Marjoram. Saw a grey looking hawk—not the usual red-brown one. A few plums on the tree. We have begun to cook apples. Eggs 2/9 doz. from Mrs Attfield."
1917.08.07,"Queer misty day. Sun not strong enough to come through. Went to Brighton after lunch. German prisoners working in the field by Dod’s Hill, laughing with the soldier, & woman passing. Went to Pier; tea at Booth’s; horrible men at our table; staged at Lewes on way back. Bicycled back from Glynde. N. & L. went to get mushrooms, & found several, also blackberries getting ripe, only have no sugar for jam."
1917.08.08,"Mist again. Went to post at Southease. L.’s foot very bad. Saw wooden pews put into traction engine at Rodmell Church; a man without a hand, a hook instead. Met Mrs Attfield with dead chicken in a parcel, found dead in the nettles, head wrung off, perhaps by a person. Home over downs. Fair haul of mushrooms again, best in hollow. Alix came; rain storm after tea, then fine."
1917.08.09,"To get mushrooms with Alix: L. stayed down sawing wood, as his foot was bad. Bunny over, & climbed the roof to see bees; didn’t take them: to be left till autumn."
1917.08.10,L. up to Labour conference in London. Fine day again. Alix & I to hills for blackberries. We found them in patches very plentiful. The servants got huge mushrooms called ‘plate’ mushrooms; the others ‘natives’ so the Woolers say.
1917.08.11,"To picnic near Firle, with Bells &c. Passed German prisoners, cutting wheat with hooks. Officer & woman with orderly galloped onto the downs. Rain came on after tea, so made a fire of wood. Henry followed us home, bit Will & frightened the servants."
1917.08.12,"Walked up mushrooming. L.’s leg still bad. Saw a large green caterpillar in hollow, with 3 purple spots on each side by the head. Mushrooms old & black. Horse mushrooms out in great circles; but very few real ones. N. & Lot. to Charleston."
1917.08.13,"Went into Lewes with Alix: she left us in the High St. L. had his leg looked at; probably a strain. Market in Lewes. Calves wrapped in sacking lying on platform. Walked back from Glynde. To get mushrooms before dinner; every grass almost had blues asleep on it. Found very few mushrooms, having seen the shepherd bring a bag down in the morning. Warned by Lottie that Will was going to blow up wasps nest after dinner, so we watched: much smell, explosion, wasps swarmed. This was done twice in nest near the hole in the wall."
1917.08.14,"To get mushrooms & blackberries; the rings of horse mushrooms seem to put an end to the others: we only get a few. Found G.L.D. when we came in. Offered a bag of mushrooms by shepherd, but found them all horses, harmless, but too timid to try. Wall done about now—not a success."
1917.08.15,"Nessa, Mabel, & children came to tea. Our pink flower she says is phlox: not stocks. Went into hollow without success; but Nelly found more mushrooms on the top. The Co-ops will allow more sugar, so we can now make jam. Gunn charges 4d quart for milk. Duncan over for dinner. They walked home at 10 over the downs. Quentin ate till he was nearly sick at tea."
1917.08.16,"L. & G.L.D. played chess all the afternoon. I went to post at Southease; the church now surrounded by scaffolding poles, & old wood panels leaning against the wall; bricklayers sitting by the gate. Woman asked me to find her children pad⁠[d]⁠ling in river: they did not want to go home. L.S. arrived. went into the hollow."
1917.08.17,"All these days have been very fine, hot, blue sky, rather a high wind. Same again today. L.S. wrote on the terrace in the morning. G.L.D. & L. played chess there in the afternoon. G.L.D. decided to go to Guildford, so we walked to Beddingham with him. L.’s foot better, but got worse with walking. Found no mushrooms; we suppose the rain brought them prematurely. No yeast, so had to eat Bakers bread, wh. is very dull & dry."
1917.08.18,"Went into Lewes, with prisoner, saw Cinema; bought several things. Met K.M.—her train very late. Bought 1 doz. Lily roots & some red leaved plants wh. have been put in the big bed."
1917.08.19,"Sat in the hollow; & found the caterpillar, now becoming a Chrysalis, wh. I saw the other day. A horrid sight: head turning from side to side, tail paralysed; brown colour, purple spots just visible; like a snake in movement. No mushrooms. Walked over the down with L.S. B. & Mr Garnett for dinner."
1917.08.20,"To Firle after tea over the down. The thistledown has been blowing (English Maryland. about these last few days. Shepherd says mushrooms 11d S. Kensington come for a fortnight & go for a fortnight. Very fine Station) still, always S.E. wind, rather high. Home by the fields. A great deal of the corn has to be cut by hand. Men still working & women too at 7."
1917.08.21,"L. to London for second conference. Very hot. L.S. went to Charleston after tea. K.M. & I walked on M.’s walk. The thistledown beginning to blow. Saw the Silver Queen over the down, going towards Brighton & coming back again. A great many aeroplanes passed over the house. Most of the butterflies have red spots on their necks—some parasite. Planted a red flower with bulb given by Mrs Wooler to Nelly—some sort of lily."
1917.08.22,"L. up to London again to see man from the foreign office. Very hot & windy again. Thistledown blowing across the house & over the field L bought me 10 packets of cigarettes: importation stopped.very thick. K.M. went after lunch, in the fly from the Ram, which took Lytton’s bag also. Two mowing machines, with 3 horses each, cutting the corn in the field across the road. Cutting round & round: finished last patch about 5. Corn already cut & standing on the fields across the river. Eating potatoes from the garden. There was a raid today. Ramsgate."
1917.08.23,"Glad to be alone. L.’s leg cured now. Lottie sick from eating plums at Charleston. We walked along the top, finding a few mushrooms, & down the next hollow, in hopes of some, but found none. Odd that they should stick to Asheham. Mist & rain; but on the whole fine, wind very high. Heather growing on the top, making it look purple: never seen it there before."
1917.08.24,"Wind still higher. Nelly went to Lewes to fetch book sent for review; almost blown off on bridge. We walked, startled hawk in the hollow, & found the feathers of a pigeon, he having carried away the bird."
1917.08.25,"I went to post at Southease. L. gardened. Another windy day. Seeing Wood from the church so rotten that it left sawdust on the grass where it stood.the church surrounded by scaffolding, I went in, floor up, pews taken away, ladders all about. A notice to say that restoration will cost £227. The church there in 966 a.d. Holes in the tower & roof visible. Men at work carting corn in the field by the road."
1917.08.26,"We meant to have a picnic at Firle, but rain started, as we were ready, & so we went to post at Beddingham instead. Left my macintosh in the hedge, so it came down hard, & we were very wet. It rained hard & steadily the whole evening & was raining violently when we went to bed. This is the first bad day we have had; even so, the morning was fine. The high wind of the last few days has broken leaves off, although only a few of the trees have begun to turn. Swallows flying in great numbers very low & swift in the field. The wind was brought down some walnuts, but they are unripe; the wasps eat holes in the plums, so we shall have to pick them. My watch stopped."
1917.08.27,"We had meant to go to Eastbourne, to get my watch mended, among other things, but about 12 it not only blew very hard but rained. The field full of swallows, & leaves broken off in bunches, so that the trees already look thin. L. thinks that the swallows are driven into the hollow by the gale, in hopes that fly’s may be out in the shelter. Swallows & leaves whirling about look much the same. L. took ms. to catch London train at Glynde: then we walked by M.’s walk on to the down; got some blackberries: the bushes laden with them; & a few mushrooms. Such wind & rain however that we were wet through & had to come home. Lit wood fire after tea. We have had them after dinner, but not yet after tea. Rained steadily; water came through the garden door."
1917.08.28,"Another most appalling day. Leaves & swallows blown about in the field; garden dishevelled. Branches down across the road; corn cocks tumbled over; rain drenching. Servants had meant to go to Brighton, but gave up. Had forgotten to order meat, so had to walk to Firle. Wind behind us going. A tree down at corner by the pond, made a frightful noise as one went beneath them. But it stopped raining, & there was some blue sky over the downs. Early closing in Firle. Grocer doing stamps in lamplight. Telephone broken by gale. Home against the wind, but dry. German prisoners now working for Hoper: work very well, if given tea at 4.30, wh. they insist upon, & will then work an extra hour. Impossible to carry corn in this weather. Gunn comes very seldom. Harvest wh. was good, now said to be ruined. Rain started again in the evening. Had to have a candle to end dinner with. Fires before dinner."
1917.08.29,"Another very bad day, though wind less furious. Swallows flying higher. Papers say storm has been all over England. Tremendous rain in the afternoon; which stopped, & we went to post at Southease, arguing about education, back over the hill; a fine evening—great sun appeared as we dined, & sunset for the first time since Saturday."
1917.08.30,"Not actually raining, though dark so the servants went to Brighton. I went over the Down; L. cut the grass in the garden. Trees have suddenly turned brown & shrivelled on their exposed sides, though still green in shelter; as if dried up by very hot sun. No autumn tints. Blue butterflies ragged & washed out. L. was stung on the ankle by a wasp. He cut into their nest. Barbara & Nick Bagenal came over to tea & dinner, which we had to scratch up for them, servants being out. Rain came on after dinner again; but wind much fallen."
1917.08.31,"Last day of August a very beautiful one. Wind soft, & steadily grew finer & hotter so that we sat out on the terrace after tea. L. cut grass again, & I went in the water-meadows & so round onto the road, up the down, creeping behind old Bosanquet. I saw a herd of cows on the top of the down driven by a soldier & a man on a large black horse. Very odd sight. The mushroom seems to be extinct. After dinner, it still being light & hot, we took the wasps nest, burning it thoroughly, though when we left it, wasps were swarming at the mouth. Great question about Mrs Wooler’s chicken; offers it for 2/6. Eggs now gone up to 3/- the dozen. Sausages here come in."
1917.09.01,"In spite of a perfect moonlit night, mist rain & wind, black all over the downs this morning. As bad as ever. However it blew so hard that it stopped raining in the afternoon. We went into the hollow, started a great hare, & then saw a man shooting. In fact they had shot at pigeons very near us. We went round & over the top. Seems now mid-autumn or even early winter from the look of things. Trees an ugly leaden colour outside, as if shrivelled, flowers beaten down & brown; butterflies scarcely flying. L. to Lewes to meet Mrs W⁠[oolf], & B. who came here about 7. Lovely night again. A great white owl, looking like a sea gull, sat on the rail, & flew about. Mushrooms started on my patch. L. took wasps."
1917.09.02,"Uncertain, windy weather, with showers in the morning; but the sun seemed to get the better steadily, & it was a fine afternoon. Round M.’s walk, in a high wind, with the visitors. Hawks out, but saw nothing else. A superb evening, hot on the terrace & light over the downs till past 9. A fine September predicted. According to the papers, in most parts every day in Aug. had rain—one of the worst on record; so we have been in luck. H.W. & M.A. went after tea."
1917.09.03,"Perfect day; completely blue without cloud or wind, as if settled for ever. Watched dog herding sheep. Rooks beginning to fly over the trees, both morning & evening, sometimes with starlings. Mrs W. & B. went after lunch. Took us to Lewes with them. Asked about watch; but can’t get it done for 3 months. Boots gone up to 40/- but found an old 15/ pair in a small shop, wh. I bought; & then found a good pair in the cupboard at home. Back by train; L. bicycled. Made a straight line across fields from Glynde, a very good way. Met Nelly bringing back Co-op. box, so walked with her. Evening so fine we went out again into the hollow. Saw a shining spot, which we could not find when we came up to it. Painted Lady [Vanessa cardui] seen near Glynde."
1917.09.04,"Woke to find the house in a mist. We have seen this on the meadows at night. It cleared, & was a perfect day, almost without wind. In the afternoon we began to pick our apples; I did the lower ones & L. the higher ones, on a farm ladder. In the middle, Clive & Mary H. appeared, so I had to stop. They stayed for tea & dinner, & walked back over the downs."
1917.09.05,"Another fine morning. I walked, & L. did the garden. I saw a clouded yellow [Colias edusa] on the top—a very deep yellow the first for a long time. Clouds brewed over the sea, & it began to rain at tea; then great thunder claps, & lightning. Difficult to distinguish thunder from guns. German prisoners walked across the field. They are now helping on this farm. Corn over the road still standing in shocks uncarted. Servants stayed at Charleston all night; say that there was gun fire as well as thunder."
1917.09.06,"To the post at Southease. A fine day, but nothing particular to be noticed."
1917.09.07,"In to Lewes, by Glynde, & the new way across the fields, to the station. Shopped, & back expecting Pernel, but she never came. A very hot, steamy day. A snake, grass, about 2 feet twisted across the path in front of us."
1917.09.08,"We went to get blackberries on the top. Found enough easily for a pudding. A cloud over the land all day, except late in the evening, when the sun came out beneath it in an odd way. Pernel came, then Philip M⁠[orrell]. then Sydney W⁠[aterlow]. as we were sitting down to dinner."
1917.09.09,"An almost motionless day; no blue sky; almost like a winter day, save for the heat. Very quiet. Over to picnic at Firle in the afternoon. Nessa & 5 children came after we had done; sat outside the trees. Walked home over the downs. Red sky over the sea. Woods almost as thin as winter, but very little colour in them."
1917.09.10,"To post at Southease, but my boots hurt, from being too big, so we sat down, & L. went on. A perfect rather misty but cloudless day, still & very hot. Odd to find no flowers in the hedges, all brown & dead, because of the storm. Often a sound like rain, which turns out to be leaves falling. German prisoners stacking corn at the back of the house. They whistle a great deal, much more complete tunes than our work men. A great brown jug for their tea."
1917.09.11,"Went over the downs by the farm; saw 2 clouded yellows by the warren, & another pair over towards Bishopstone. Heard guns & saw two airships maneuvring over the sea & valley. Found Lady’s Tresses, & Field Gentian on the Downs. Very hot day, but cold in the evening, & so had fire. Swallows have quite left the field. Pernel left. L. found a walnut sprouting with leaves & planted it in the garden."
1917.09.12,"I bicycled to Charleston, getting there at 12.30 A long & rather dull bit of road between Glynde & Charleston—but going slowly it is easy to do it in under the hour. L. came after tea & we bicycled back the other way by Beanstalk lane, discovered a probable short cut. Gigantic sun; colder, & windier than before. Corn in field opposite carried about now."
1917.09.13,"A windy day. I went onto the down, after going to Southease. They have taken a slice out of the church tower; you can see a wooden frame inside. Blew up a storm of rain, had a fire after tea; servants to Charleston, home in storm over the downs. Had tea in kitchen, & saw old man who is thatching the ricks raking apples off the tree into a bucket. L. called out “When you’ve done!” & he ran away."
1917.09.14,"Meant to go to Lewes, as it became fine, but my bicycle found punctured; very annoying; but it was hopeless to start, so Nelly went instead on Mrs Hammond’s, & got us a lot of things. Very hot & fine by degrees; seems to take a lot of time to get really fine. We went after mushrooms but found none—A most disappointing season. Cut up a great fungus like cheese."
1917.09.15,"A perfect day for our treat. We went to Eastbourne. Sat in Devonshire park & watched tennis & heard band. Saw an aeroplane in field near Glynde. It looked like a toy. Children round it: man working propeller round. Had tea & ice; bought Kodak; home to Lewes, where we bought stuff &c. Lord Hugh Cecil got out of the train at Glynde, with a guardsman &c; very amusing to watch: he had 3 leather bags; dressed as flying officer; quite white haired."
1917.09.16,"An almost sunless, but fine day. Clouds too high for rain. Walked to Firle & had picnic. L. went on with Kodak to Charleston. I waited for him by the trees. After a time, Robin Mayor & Bobo M. came, to my surprise: at Talland (wh. they still have) for week end: had let it to Belgians. L. came back; N⁠[essa]. thought the Kodak wd. cause great jealousy, so kept it. Silver Queen over sea; a bar of red across the sea, like last Sunday. Will brought his ferrets & caught a rabbit for the servants."
1917.09.17,"Servants went in float, driven by Will, at 10: Mrs Hammond came. Time changed at 3 to winter time. A windy changeable day. Telegram from MacCs’ after lunch. Molly cant come; D. comes tomorrow. Went to post at Southease & back the usual way over the downs, talking about arctic regions. Rainy. Made chair cover after tea. A very dark evening, by new time."
1917.09.18,"A furious wet day; rain lashing across, sea mist when not pouring. Nevertheless we started for Lewes; but were driven back at the turning by the water mill. Spent afternoon indoors, a treat. Settled down after dinner to print photographs, deciding that D⁠[esmond] wouldn’t come; but he arrived at 8; had driven out in a fly; had to find some dinner for him."
1917.09.19,"Telegram to put off picnic. Day looked very bad, rained & blew all the afternoon. Walked with D. to Rodmell to ask about whiskey. Public House shut up; man came & cd. sell us none till 6. Stayed talking about the war “Whats it for?” & how soldiers wd. break the windows if they came home & found no beer. Met German prisoners on the road. D. said Guten Tag, & they all answered. Sentry said nothing. Real winter now."
1917.09.20,"Another grey windy day, though not so much rain. Brilliant sun & blue sky for about 10 minutes in the afternoon. L. had to get whiskey in Rodmell. Picked apples, he on the table. Then to get milk at cottage, & round into hollow, where we found 3 mushrooms; & the spine & red legs of a bird, just devoured by a hawk—either pigeon or partridge. Very windy, but a starry night."
1917.09.21,"A fine day happily, though windy. L. went into Lewes to have his hair cut. I walked round M.’s walk with Desmond. Lay down a great deal in the sun, talking about society in the 70ties. Five Silver Queens over the sea round Newhaven looking for submarines D. says."
1917.09.22,"Another very fair day, though well in autumn now. The rooks settling on the trees, & making a great noise in the early morning. A few walnuts ripe. Dahlia fully out in the bed. Trees now so thin that I can see the postman through them at the top of the hill. Clover in field opposite has been cut, & lies on the field. Still some corn standing across on the downs. Sat on the terrace after lunch: L. did garden. D. went to Glynde after tea; we sat over fire."
1917.09.23,"Fine day. Picked apples in the afternoon, & stole straw & laid them on straw in the attics. Strolled out after tea. It becomes suddenly very cold. A more wintry sunset—very highly coloured. Too cold to stay out late. Desmond’s story after dinner."
1917.09.24,"Desmond left at 9 in the fly. An absolutely perfect autumn day. Lewes half under mist, gradually lifting. No wind. To Lewes. I to Glynde, L. bicycling all the way in order to buy plants. I met Duncan at Glynde, going on his holidays. Had 2 pears. Great crowd for the London train. Apparently my letter to Nessa lost. Shopped in Lewes. Back to Glynde & bicycled home, through a herd of Alderneys; goat got in front & ran some way. Superb sunset. Men working very late carting the clover. A threshing machine at work behind the wood."
1917.09.25,"The day looked so fine that we planned a picnic at Telscombe. However it turned windy with a strange black haze over the sun—like a sea mist gone black, & only in parts, for it was very fine over Lewes. But it seemed too cold to picnic far away, so we went into the valley by the deserted farm. Saw a woman painting, & asked her to keep an eye on my bicycle. Went into the valley, up a little on the other side. Had tea there. Found a field of corn flowers & poppies, apparently sewn in rows. Picked a bunch, also some roots wh. L. has planted in the front garden."
1917.09.26,"A rather cold day, though fine. L. picked apples, having borrowed the shepherd’s ladder. I went to post at Southease. Passed 2 troops of cadets, each headed by officer & chaplain. Home over the down—a stray horse running along the road the only other incident. Our sunflowers out now. A shooting party walking about, firing a good deal."
1917.09.27,"A fine still day. Walked along the top, after getting a few apples in a butterfly net, & found the best clumps of mushrooms for a long time in the hollow. Still hazy, perfectly fine day. The Woolers picked apples; were given half."
1917.09.28,"Another very quiet day, which grew dark, though warm & still. Bicycled to Charleston. Roger there. Fine border of flowers. Monkbrettia(?) is the name of the orange lily. Old man brought our flowers out."
1917.09.29,"L. came over at 3.30. Morning very lovely—seems settled into perfect weather now. Took a great many photographs. Aeroplanes over the house early, which may mean another raid. Nights bright moonlight. Home bicycling across the fields all the way—more than a mile shorter than the other way. Great red sun sinking about 6. L. says the rooks came & picked walnuts off the tree this morning—saw one flying with walnut in his beak. Has planted the Japanese anemones etc. in the front beds, on the terrace & in the back garden. We mean to abolish the large round bed."
1917.09.30,"A perfect day. Up on the top, & found a handkerchief full of mushrooms. Met Nessa & Roger walking up to meet us. They heard guns over London & saw lights last night. Another raid. We heard nothing; save Mrs Hammond, who heard the guns very loud, as she went home. Clear moonlit nights. They went back after tea."
1917.10.01,"Bicycled in to Lewes—there & back. Passed a drunk man being driven into Lewes on his fruit cart by a policeman. Met another shouting held by 2 policemen in Lewes. Market presumably. Shopped. Met Roger. Anxious about raids. Another last night between 7 & 8: we listened but saw & heard nothing. The weather still perfectly fine warm without wind. Men came & fetched fallen trees, dragging them with horses."
1917.10.02,"Another fine day. Started the path in the walled garden this afternoon, & the flower bed by it. We make the path with cobbles from the wall, & work the old cement in. Great fun to do, & looks very nice from the drawing room already. Children came to tea. Looked about the house; we gave them 2 of L.’s heads of deer which they liked very much. Walked a little way back, & onto the down for mushrooms, which have begun again. Had to lie down to escape Henry who ran over the top. Clouded after tea. Heard firing."
1917.10.03,"Not such a fine day. Wind rose, & grew cloudy. However, the raids will be stopped. Did the garden path all the afternoon. Planted some wall flowers, daisies, foxgloves. Into the hollow after tea, when almost dark. Had to send Will in for book to Lewes. Got windier. He only came back at 10; knocked, & could not make us hear (so he says)."
1917.10.04,"Our last day a thoroughly bad one from the point of view of weather. Wind & rain; completely black sky. L. had to go, walking there & back, to Lewes to order our car for tomorrow. I went round M.’s walk for the last time. Rain stopped, but wind so tremendous that Nessa & Duncan wouldn’t be able to come as arranged. Mushroom season evidently setting in. Found several on the top. Had to lean against the wind coming down. Great fall of walnuts. Men throwing sticks to bring them down. Couldn’t work at the path. A fine starry night however."
1917.10.08,"This attempt at a diary is begun on the impulse given by the discovery in a wooden box in my cupboard of an old volume, kept in 1915, & still able to make us laugh at Walter Lamb. This therefore will follow that plan—written after tea, written indiscreetly, & by the way I note here that L. has promised to add his page when he has something to say. His modesty is to be overcome. We planned today to get him an autumn outfit in clothes, & to stock me with paper & pens. This is the happiest day that exists for me. It rained steadily of course. London seems unchanged, making me think of the change there used to be when one was a child. There was a man buying boots who had such a taste in boots that he knew different cuts & rows of nails; & was very cross when told his pair was “nice & strong”. “I hate nice, strong boots” he growled. Evidently there is a taste in boots. We walked through Gough Sqre; Dr Johnson’s house a fine, very well kept place, not so shabby as I expected. A little square, folded in behind Chancery Lane, & given over to printing presses. This is the best part of London to look at—not I now think to live in. Carrying my manuscript to the Times I felt like a hack much in keeping. We left it with a porter, & ran into Bruce Richmond, shining out a perfect gentleman in white gloves on the Ludgate Hill platform. He flourished his hat & disappeared. Liz has a son; therefore our fears as to paternity are set at rest."
1917.10.09,"We had a horrid shock. L. came in so unreasonably cheerful that I guessed a disaster. He has been called up. Though rather dashed for 20 minutes, my spirit mounted to a certainty that, save the nuisance, we have nothing to fear. But the nuisance—waiting a week, examination at 8.30 at Kingston—visits to Craig & Wright for certificates—is considerable. It was piteous to see him shivering, physically shivering, so that we lit his gas fire, & only by degrees became more or less where we were in spirits; & still, if one could wake to find it untrue, it would be a mercy.

We took a proof of the first page of K.M.’s story, The Prelude. It looks very nice, set solid in the new type. Masses of bookbinding equipment from Emma Vaughan arrived this morning—rather a testimony to her fads, for it is all good, & I suppose she never bound a book. But this is uncharitable considering. We had a short walk by the river. As it is a fine, fairly still evening, perhaps I shall have a raid to describe tomorrow. Trissie is staying her holiday with us. I forget how many people rang us up this morning, Alix for one, who wants to start her work apparently; & we have a liver & bacon Clumber [spaniel] in view, living at Wimbledon, the property of a man taken for the army. The K. Shuttleworths advertise the birth of a boy with the statement “His Perfect Gift” a good title for an Academy picture, or a Mrs Ward novel, & rather a terrible testimony to the limelight now desired by the rich upon their sacrifices."
1917.10.10,"No air raid; no further disturbance by our country’s needs; in fact L. made out in his bath that he deserved some good fortune, & opening his letters found a cheque for £12 from a Swedish paper which never was born & yet pays its debts. And I had 4/ for myself. Late last night, I was told to have my Henry James done if possible on Friday, so that I had to make way with it this morning, & as I rather grudge time spent on articles, & yet cant help spending it if I have it, I am rather glad that this is now out of my power. And another article upon the country in Hardy & E. Brontë is suggested. We walked down the river, through the park, & back to an early tea. At this moment L. is bringing the 17 Club into existence. I am sitting over the fire, & we have the prospect of K. Mansfield to dinner, when many delicate things fall to be discussed. We notice how backward the leaves are in falling & yellowing here compared with Asheham. It might still be August, save for the acorns scattered on the path—suggesting to us the mysterious dispensation which causes them to perish, or we should be a forest of oaks."
1917.10.11,"The dinner last night went off: the delicate things were discussed. We could both wish that ones first impression of K.M. was not that she stinks like a—well civet cat that had taken to street walking. In truth, I’m a little shocked by her commonness at first sight; lines so hard & cheap. However, when this diminishes, she is so intelligent & inscrutable that she repays friendship. My saying—Chaste & the Unchaste—was exaggerated by Murry for reasons of his own; reasons that make him wish all of a sudden to break with Garsington. We discussed Henry James, & K.M. was illuminating I thought. A munition worker called Leslie Moor came to fetch her—another of these females on the border land of propriety, & naturally inhabiting the underworld—rather vivacious, sallow skinned, without any attachment to one place rather than another. Today poor L. had to go the round of Drs & committees, with a visit to Squire thrown in. His certifications are repeated. He weighs only 9.6. I bought my winter store of gloves, got a reference in the London Library, & met L. at Spikings for tea. Heaven blessed us by sending a quick train, & we came home, very glad to be home, over our fire, though we had to light it, & cook up our dinner, owing to the servants off day."
1917.10.14,"That is an awful confession, & seems to show the signs of death already spreading in this book. I have excuses though. We were rung up & asked to dine with the Bells in Soho, & this, I regret to say, led to much argument; we put off going to Kingston; the night was wet, & L. didn’t want—old arguments in short were brought out, with an edge to them. So we went dolefully enough, found the place, behind the palace, dined with Roger, Nina Hamnet, Saxon & Barbara & a party such as might figure in a Wells novel: I enjoyed it though, & L. was a model of self-control. Clive’s remarks tended to prove that he is at the centre of everything, but not so aggressive as usual. Nessa has found her governess—sent, apparently by the hand of God. Then on Saturday—what happened? Saturday was entirely given over to the military. We are safe again, &, so they say for ever. Our appearance smoothed every obstacle; & by walking across Kingston we got to the doctor about 12, & all was over by half past. I waited in a great square, surrounded by barrack buildings, & was reminded of a Cambridge college—soldiers crossing, coming out of staircases, & going into others; but gravel & no grass. A disagreeable impression of control & senseless determination. A great boarhound, emblem of military dignity I suppose, strolled across by himself. L. was a good deal insulted: the drs. referred to him as “the chap with senile tremor”, through a curtain. Mercifully the impression slowly vanished as we went about Richmond. Herbert came to tea, bringing the dog, Tinker, a stout, active, bold brute, brown & white, with large luminous eyes, reminding me a little of Dominic Spring-Rice. We have taken him for a walk, but directly he is loosed, he leaps walls, dashes into open doors, & behaves like a spirit in quest of something not to be found. We doubt rather if we can cope with him. Have I put down our Manx cat, also presented to us, one day this week?

L. is up at Hampstead. We are to have Alix & Lilian [Harris] to dinner."
1917.10.15,"The chief fact today I think is the development & discovery of Tinker’s character—all in the right direction. He was taken a long walk by the river the avenue & the Park; his spirit is great, but almost under control. He fell into the river twice; jumped out again; circled madly with a black poodle, & investigated several garden gates, which seem to have a fascination for him. He is a human dog, aloof from other dogs. Alix & Lilian were much as usual last night, save that Lilian had a dark patch on the top of her head, & heard almost perfectly; the dark patch is a cup for catching sound. A more modest, amiable, & yet quietly well informed & resolute character does not exist. Her principles are invariably liberal, although her character is naturally conservative—rather a good mixture. Moreover, she has always depended on her brain, & thus discusses with great sense any question, so long as it isn’t art, that comes up. Alix has the same air of level headed desperation, solid, capacious, but as low in tone as a coal cellar. However we found her very anxious to take on our work; & comes to learn tomorrow. Manx is sitting on L.’s knee; Tinker occasionally looks at him."
1917.10.16,"Its odd how fate crams money into our mouths when we’ve got enough, & starves us when we’re empty. Here we’ve made 270 (I think) in Bah Lias, & this morning they write to say that Mitchells is paying 4/ in £. so that brings us another £120. Two years ago we had awkward debts, & had to sell out to pay them. We both make big or fairly big cheques monthly by reviewing. We started printing in earnest after lunch, & Alix came punctually; was instructed, & left on her high stool while we took the air with Tinkler, who jumped from a parapet into a boat covered with tarpaulin, crashed through, & out again, unhurt though surprised. We came back to find Perera, wearing his slip & diamond initial in his tie as usual; in fact, the poor little mahogany coloured wretch has no variety of subjects. The character of the Governor, & the sins of the Colonial Office, these are his topics; always the same stories, the same point of view, the same likeness to a caged monkey, suave on the surface, inscrutable beyond. He made me uncomfortable by producing an e⁠[n]⁠velope of lace—“a souvenir from Ceylon Mrs Woolf”—more correctly a bribe, but there was no choice but to take it. He being gone upstairs, Alix solemnly & slowly explained that she was bored, & also worried by her 2 hours composing, & wished to give it up. A sort of morbid scrutiny of values & of motives, joined with crass laziness, leads her to this decision; as I expect it will lead her to many more. She has a good brain, but not enough vitality to keep it working. The idea weighed upon her, & I assured her there was no need for it to weigh."
1917.10.17,"I went up to the show of pictures at Heal’s this afternoon, L. having spent the morning at a Coop. conference. First I stood at Mudies counter while a stout widow chose 10 novels; taking them from the hand of Mudies man, like a lapdog, only stipulating that she wanted no vulgarity, not much description, but plenty of incident. Her companion recommended South Wind—much praised by the reviews—all clever conversation, Italy; “but I can’t bear conversation—I like sensation” said the widow & gulped down another mass of sweet sensation warranted not about the war, nor about drunkards. “I must really reduce my subscription to 8 I think” she observed; & waddled off with her ten volumes to Woking, so I guessed.

Ottoline was not at her ease; closely buttoned up in black velvet, hat like a parasol, satin collar, pearls, tinted eyelids, & red gold hair. Needless to say one saw nothing of the pictures. Aldous Huxley was there—infinitely long & lean, with one opaque white eye. A nice youth. We walked up & down a gallery discussing his Aunt, Mrs Humphry Ward. The mystery of her character deepens; her charm & wit & character all marked as a woman, full of knowledge & humour—& then her novels. These are partly explained by Arnold, who brought them near bankruptcy 4 years ago, & she rescued the whole lot by driving her pen day & night. We had tea with Roger. I was very much conscious of strain—Ott. languid, & taking refuge in her great ladyhood, which is always depressing. They both seemed to have their quarrel before their eyes. I walked with her in the downpour to Oxford Street, she buying me crimson carnations, without cordiality."
1917.10.18,"L. out until 5 at his conference: & the telephone rang constantly (so I thought, as I tried to pin Mrs Meynell down in a review). A dull life without him! Even Tinkler’s restless mind did not make up. One’s right hand becomes quite cramped holding his chain. Let loose he is very random, but on the whole obedient.* I had my tea in the kitchen, & L. came as I finished it; we sit surrounded by kittens & dogs, who now verge upon a suspicious relationship of some sort. We now expect Ka.

* This, I must say, applies to Tinker, not to L."
1917.10.19,"The sweetness of Ka’s nature, so we thought, is triumphing over the bureaucracy which threatened to straitwaistcoat all her charm. Not but what office life isn’t a pool past which one has to lead her. She complains of falling hair; but looked to me softer & rosier, & more of the smoothness of cream than for a long while. She spent the night, was down with her leather case in hand to catch an early train. I had a letter from Nessa, about servants, & so went up to Mrs Hunts this afternoon—a mysterious building, all glass compartments, leading to a space given up to the ironing & washing of pink & blue pinafores, or so it looked. Not a parlourmaid to be had. With some skilful manipulation of trains, I reached the Aeolian Hall, paid my shilling & heard a very long & very lovely Schubert octet. Coming out, I saw a grey, shockheaded woman without a hat—Alix; & we had tea at Spikings. She has a kind of independence & lack of concern for appearances which I admire. But as we walked up & down Dover Street she seemed on the verge of rolling up the usual veil of laughter & gossip & revealing her sepulchral despair—poor woman.

Where are you going now Alix?

I really dont know.

Well that sounds dismal! Dont you look forward to say eleven tomorrow morning?

I merely wish it didn’t exist that’s all!

So I left her, hatless, aimless, unattached, wandering in Piccadilly."
1917.10.20,"Happily, or she might say unhappily for Alix she didn’t presumably wander in Piccadilly all night, or the great bomb which ploughed up the pavement opposite Swan & Edgar’s might have dug her grave. We heard two soft distant but unmistakable shocks about 9.30; then a third which shook the window; then silence. It turns out that a Zeppelin came over, hovered unseen for an hour or two & left. We heard no more of it.

Going out for a walk, we ran into a smooth, sleek provincial looking man at the pillar box, our Walter—sent by Heaven for the baptism of this book I think. And he stuck to us for hours; walked with us, came back to tea, & would with encouragement, which flagged, have dined. His stories were all of Lord Canterbury, & Mrs Saxton Noble, & the R.A.: each story throwing a gleam of light upon his own success, or tact, or prosperity. Not much gossip about the King however. He prefers the Queen, & mad Princess Victoria, who breaks into his room & announces that she means to live in his house. His complexion is that of a wax figure, his head is as smooth as an egg; he has the same cultivated taste in books, & style that he used to have, though no longer a writer, or indeed anything but a Secretary to the President, to whom he seems filial & parasitic. To us his attitude is half friendly, half suspicious. He has cast in his lot with the orthodox, but can’t make up his mind to lose the other world entirely."
1917.10.21,"Lytton came to luncheon, & Goldie to dinner—so we must have talked for 6 or 7 hours. We walked down the river & through the Park. Lytton in good spirits, having finished a book of 100,000 words, though now pretending that it can’t be published. He means to leave London, & live “for ever” in the country. At this moment Saxon & Oliver are inspecting houses in Berkshire. It seems a good thing that one’s friends should try experiments. Poor old Goldie is evidently beyond that stage. If I were malicious I should say he had reached the stage of the complete conversationalist. A long story at dinner, very skillfully told; suited to keep the High Table amused; then facts with Leonard after dinner. One finds less power of detachment in the elderly. This war seems to possess him, to leave little over. In fact he looked shrunk & worn: infinitely good, charming, devoted, every ounce of vitality rightly applied—no time for experiments, not enough curiosity perhaps, though extreme kindliness & sympathy, which in the case of young men, becomes amorous. He has been asked to go to Russia for The Manchester Guardian; but doubts if he will get a passport.
"
1917.10.22,"The moon grows full, & the evening trains are packed with people leaving London. We saw the hole in Piccadilly this afternoon. Traffic has been stopped, & the public slowly tramps past the place, which workmen are mending, though they look small in comparison with it. Swan & Edgar has every window covered with sacking or planks; you see shop women looking out from behind; not a glimpse of stuffs, but “business goes on as usual” so they say. Windows are broken according to no rule; some intact, some this side, some that. Our London Library stands whole, however, & we found our books, & came home in the tube, standing the whole way to Hammersmith, & have just come in. Bert is wounded, & Nellie has gone to Liz. She felt it her duty & also her right—which shows how the servant is bettering her state in this generation."
1917.10.23,"Another lapse in this book, I must confess; but, if I do it against my humour I shall begin to loathe it; so the one chance of life it has is to submit to lapses uncomplainingly. I remember though that we walked, printed, & Margaret came to tea. How pale these elderly women get! The rough pale skin of toads, unfortunately: M. in particular easily loses the flash of her beauty. This time we were whelmed in the Coop, revolution; the characters of Mr King & Mr May, & possibilities. I get an occasional swinge of the tail which reminds me of the extremely insignificant position I have in this important world. I get a little depressed, a little anxious to find fault—a question of not being in the right atmosphere. L. I suppose feels the same about Gordon Sqre. And then the minute care which the elderly & solicitous take of each other impresses me: “must be back or Lilian will be anxious” questions of fatigue or cold always cropping up—partly the unmarried state perhaps; partly the sense of being the centre of one’s world, which Margaret very naturally has. But of course her niceness & valiancy always conquer me in spite of injured vanity."
1917.10.24,"L. to some confounded meeting; but also to take our selected sample of paper to Mr Byles, whom he met coming out of the New Statesman office. I did a little printing, & then up to Janet. With time one would naturally welcome wet & wind; already the worst chill of them is over, because one thinks of them as safety against the raid. So today I hardly grumbled, though it was heavy rain, cold, dark, inhuman, primeval weather. The Case ménage is extremely cheerful to step into; such a welcome, such anxiety about China tea or Indian, an egg, fresh bread & butter—clothes dried with a duster. Emphie spirited, discursive, inconsecutive as usual, about her day & her Ecko [? a hearing aid], & servants, & sugar & honey, all fresh & sensible, & evidently the fruit of experience, which has not embittered or aged her, though it has not given her much power of concentration. She went to write her notes, after tea (this is her great occupation) Janet & I talked, getting on well as usual. But I was packed off to wait 15 minutes at Finchley Road, lest I should miss my train; & travelled with a mother & three boys who made all the elderly gentlemen shy & yet cordial to watch their kisses & antics from behind their newspapers."
1917.10.25,"Owing to the usual circumstances, I had to spend the day recumbent. However this is much mitigated by printing, which I do from my bed on the sloping table. We took off a proof of 2 pages, on paper of the right size & liked the looks of it immensely. Our paper will be soft & yellow tinted. A melancholy letter from Ott. this morning, complaining of age & ugliness, the weariness of London & the sadness of not being wanted—all so true, I suppose, that we have accepted an invitation, on my part rather out of pity; though also a feeling of liking for her persists. Saxon & Barbara dined with us; we are lending Asheham to the whole of that curious constellation—Nick & Saxon will revolve round Barbara; who twinkles rosily but modestly in the light of their admiration; very neat, nice, motherly. Saxon as usual when with her—gentle & giving off a sound as of a boiling, but not over boiling, kettle; speechless of course. As she has only simple direct things to say, L. & I were a little sleepy; but we have arranged that she is to take up printing when Nick goes back [to France]. I am going to Asheham on Monday with Saxon."
1917.10.26,"Either it is cold or wet or windy at night, so we sleep well, though the moon is now almost full. We are faced with the problem of providing for Tinker. His spirits make him an exacting guest. We went to find a home with the Vet. today, & discovered that a Vet. lives in part of the great red house at the back of us. We looked into a room, laid for tea, the tablecloth laid like a diamond across the table; a girl came; & I saw a black & white paved hall, evidently a fine house, now cut up into different bits. Nelly has just come back: the usual laughter begins again. We gave Lottie 5/ for doing so well."
1917.10.27,"We were just setting off for Kingston Barracks this afternoon to get L.’s exemption card, when the telephone rang, & I heard Clive’s now unfamiliar & apparently rather nervous voice asking whether he might dine with us. So the breach is to be repaired very rapidly. We walked through the Park to Kingston, failed to get the card, & then had tea in Kingston, ending by buying me a 15/ watch for my wrist—a round bright, serviceable turnip, which I look at constantly, & really find it a saver of time. We were back late; & Clive came & was I thought, very pleasant, easy garrulous; starting a great many hares & chasing them smartly, & letting off his little tributes to himself quite inoffensively. He is so brisk & well kept mentally that I like an evening of him. L. immensely good tempered & urbane into the bargain. We gossiped; spun swiftly from thing to thing—Characters, French books, the Mansfield intrigue, & so on. He wears his chestnut suit; combs his hair back to hide the bald spot, but didn’t hitch his trousers so much as usual—in short, he was at his best. Adrian has a drs. order not to work on the land any longer."
1917.10.28,"Still no raids, presumably the haze at evening keeps them off, though it is still, & the moon perfectly clear. The numbers who have gone out of London this week must feel a little foolish. A perfect cold October day; sun red through the leaves which are still hanging. In order to keep as much in L.’s company as I could, I determined to go to Staines with him. We walked from Shepperton through Laleham, & so to Staines by the river. Flat very quiet country, or country just turning into town. Pink arm chairs were drawn up round a crowded but not luxurious tea table; a multiplicity of little plates, minute knives, people told to help themselves. Mr Lock, with some impediment was there, & soon Alice, Flora, Clara & Sylvia all appeared—malice suggested the whole of Kensington High Street poured into a room. The normality of it all impressed me. Nothing beautiful; nothing definite; most strange why nature has produced this type in such abundance. Then, the servant said “Mr Sturgeon”; Flora cried “I will go” dashed from the room; everyone said Oh! Ah! How Splendid!, as if on the stage, which indeed the whole scene might have been. We went, after the 2nd act; Tinker dashed off; but was recovered, & so home, very cold, & Herbert looked in, & here we sit over the fire, & I wish it were this time next week."
1917.11.02,"It almost is “this time next week”; though not quite—in fact not nearly, since L. is giving a lecture at Birkenhead at this precise moment, & will then I suppose travel all night across England before reaching me. I find it impossible to read after a railway journey; I cant open Dante or think of him without a shudder—the cause being I think partly the enormous numbers of newspapers I’ve been reading in. Lottie brought me all the Times’s which have accumulated. I feel as if I’d moved about a great deal; kept moving to keep myself warm. I mean Asheham & Charleston were rather in the nature of distractions, so as not to think how strange & solitary I was. Not solitary in the literal sense of course. First I spent 2 days with Saxon; much detail, rather heightened by his greater warmth of intimacy. He is still surprised by his own sensations; takes them out, sees how they fit in; very anxious to be sure of their quality. Of course the quality is very high. The worst one can say is that his lack of virility tends to prettify & belittle to some extent. But I daresay this is the effect of B’s not very marked or magnificent nature. And of course, too, he’s exquisite in his own way; so pure, wise, good, & sensitive. Most curiously unable to cope with anything needing decision; his instinct is obviously always to avoid risk by remaining motionless. When forced to order coal or a cab his indecision is that of a spinster of 70. And yet intellectually he is definite enough; definite, but meticulous. He’s in love, & yet content that B. should marry Nick.

There was the new governess, Miss Edwards at Charleston; a very pretty, rather sharp, not very well bred or well educated young woman who has I should imagine lived on the capital of her large eyes, flaxen hair, straight dark eyebrows so much that she is a little out of it in an element where these attractions are discounted. There is no one to make eyes at—save Bunny, who remains impervious. But she controls Julian; talks French evidently rather more naturally than English. I meant to ask her what she thinks in. Yesterday it rained all day, so I sat in; writing about Aksakoff in the morning; sitting in the Studio after luncheon. Duncan painted a table, & Nessa copied a Giotto. I unpacked all my bits of gossip. They are very large in effect, these painters; very little self-conscious; they have smooth broad spaces in their minds where I am all prickles & promontories. Nevertheless to my thinking few people have a more vigorous grasp or a more direct pounce than Nessa. Two little boys with very active minds keep her in exercise. I like the feeling that she gives of a whole nature in use. In working order I mean; living practically, not an amateur, as Duncan & Bunny both to some extent are of course. I suppose this is the effect of children & of responsibility, but I always remember it in her. A love of the actual fact, is strong in her. Julian came with his letter into my room this morning; & at once curled up on my bed, & went on reading a book with a picture of a Bird of Paradise in it. He told me he had read Gardiner’s history perhaps 50 times. He disliked Kings because they were so dull; but liked Newcastle. Irish history bored him because it was shapeless, as far as I could make out; he couldn’t see that either side was in the right about the American war, which annoyed him; & he thought if we had given way about the taxes we should have got our way without their knowing it, as we have done with our other colonies. Quentin called him to lessons, or he would have gone on at length. I was a good deal impressed. Suddenly to find a child reasoning & inheriting these old puzzles gives one rather a shock. It seems a pity there can’t be a new history for each new generation; & yet its queer to hand over the old things to the new brains. I daresay he’ll do a lot of work one of these days; is it a sign of age that one’s interested & inclined to see great virtue in the youngest generation?

But I was glad to come home, & feel my real life coming back again—I mean life here with L. Solitary is not quite the right word; one’s personality seems to echo out across space, when he’s not there to enclose all one’s vibrations. This is not very intelligibly written; but the feeling itself is a strange one—as if marriage were a completing of the instrument, & the sound of one alone penetrates as if it were a violin robbed of its orchestra or piano. A dull wet night, so I shall sleep. The raid happened of course, with us away."
1917.11.03-05,"The raid didn’t actually happen but with our nerves in the state they are (I should say Lottie’s & Nelly’s nerves) the dipping down of the electric lights was taken as a sign of warning: finally the lights went out, & standing on the kitchen stairs I was deluged with certain knowledge that the extinction of light is in future our warning. I looked out of the hall door, however, heard the usual patter & voices of suburbans coming home; & then, to bear out my assurance, the lights suddenly came on again. We went to bed & to sleep. I woke 5 minutes before 7, & lay listening, but heard nothing, & was about, at 8 o’clock to flatten out all my expectations when I heard L. at the door & there he was! With the softness of a mouse he had let himself in & breakfasted. We talked for as long as we could; things kept oozing out; sudden silences & spurts; divine contentment at being once more harmonious. L. travelled all night. The most pungent of his tales is to me the story of the arguing & enquiring & experimenting. Mrs Ekhard who thrust herself into all sorts of subjects, with L., while he cut down her trees. The palms of his hands are still black from the soot of Manchester bark. We walked by the river, & to bed rather early. L. having denied that he was at all tired, tumbled asleep & slept till he was called.

On Sunday I finished my Aksakoff, & writing has the advantage of making a weekday out of the Sabbath, in spite of the clamour & blare of military music & church bells which always takes place at about 11—a noise which the other people have no right to inflict. We went up the river & through the Park, for it was a lovely warm day; & passed our Walter again with a man who looked like a schoolmaster. No deer are to be seen in the lower park, where the cedars are. And Perera came to tea, & I shut him alone with L. having no wish for more yards of lace. I think, however, that L. is now menaced with a gold watch, owing to the success of the Ceylon business. The Daily News bursts out in three separate places in indignation.

And today we’ve been to London, & just come back, & sit waiting for dinner. Expecting life & smartness at least I spent 8d upon a Magazine with Mrs Asquith’s love letters, & they’re as flat & feeble & vulgar & illiterate as a provincial Mrs Glyn might be; with something insolent about them, as though she condescended in scribbling— We went to the London Library, as usual; coming out ran in to the hatless dusky figure, L.’s dame secretaire: Alix; on her way to grope for facts, which L.’s eye finds a good deal quicker. We saw the hole in Piccadilly almost mended, though the glass is still broken. L. to Williams & Norgate about his book, which kept him so long that I had time to despise Mrs A. pretty thoroughly in Clifford’s Inn tea rooms. The talk was heated; L. accused of low dealing in offering his book to Bell. (Margaret’s doing). Some arrangement may be come to; but the man an incompetent & stupid creature, who wont give way, & will have his rights. Hanging on a strap in the Tube was Malcolm Macnaghten; grey, spruce & prosperous looking."
1917.11.06,"The melancholy fact is that Tinker, at the present moment, 5.30, is lost. He was let out in the garden, got into the next door house, & finding their garden door open, presumably escaped. This was discovered at lunch time. When we had done L. went off to look in the neighbourhood, but without success. We took the Bus to Kingston; visited for the last time let us hope in our lives, the Recruiting Office, & after waiting in the familiar room with the two wooden benches, the towel hanging up & the khaki coat, L. was summoned, & given his paper which states that he is “permanently & totally disabled.” We suppose this might fetch £500 if sold. However, we were rather dashed by the loss of the spaniel whom we had come to like. We gave information at the Police Office. Their immense kindness & good sense much impressed us. After taking notes, ringing up Kew &c. the police sergeant said “Much obliged to you, Sir”. Its melancholy to be asking about lost dogs again. After our experience with Tim even I find it hard to be altogether sanguine."
1917.11.10,"Another melancholy fact is that I’ve let all these days pass—two of them, Wednesday & Thursday because I was out late, the third Friday because I was too gloomy, & we were both too argumentative, to make writing possible. However, to deal with the dissipations first, though I dont admit they were the cause of the gloom. Nessa was up, & I had a Bloomsbury afternoon. First I took my watch to a man in Poland Street, who says it needs cleaning only, then I went to the Omega where in the semidark Roger was convoying three chattering Frenchwomen round the show, & giving the impression as usual that French manners & language have a peculiar relish for him. The pictures glimmered through the dusk; & I was chiefly impressed by the Gertlers; Vanessa, too, very good: Duncan, I thought, a little pretty or tending to be. Faith vacillated about, endeavouring to make me see her show of dresses, this being private view day. We had tea in the sewing room—walking up & down munching dry cake, while Mabel stitched lining in a corner, & Roger wrote letters on his knee. Nessa came on top of this & we left, I buying an apricot coloured coat on my way. I had tea in Gordon Square, which always puzzles me under the new arrangement, there being no sitting room. She is brooding some new educational scheme—6 boys, a tutor & a governess; has planned it all for next summer. Miss Edwards has taken to meeting soldiers on the downs, & her capacity won’t last long. This was the prelude to a party [at 46 Gordon Square] on Thursday, to which I went, through the wet & the dirt, a very long expedition for 2 hours of life, though I enjoyed it. The usual people were there, the usual sensation of being in a familiar but stimulating atmosphere, in which all the people one’s in the habit of thinking of, were there in the body. A great many mop headed young women in amber & emerald sitting on the floor. Molly, Vanessa & I represented mature matronhood. Oliver seemed to be the friendly & amorous Uncle. Ray one might call the grandmother; very commanding, immensely well nourished, & competent. I spent most of my time with Oliver, & as the clock struck 10 I got up and went—an example of virtue if ever there was one. And now we see how the gloom came about. L. was testy, dispiriting, & tepid. We slept. I woke to a sense of failure & hard treatment. This persisted, one wave breaking after another, all day long. We walked on the river bank in a cold wind, under a grey sky. Both agreed that life seen without illusion is a ghastly affair. Illusions wouldn’t come back. However they returned about 8.30, in front of the fire, & were going merrily till bedtime, when some antics ended the day.

Today has been very cheerful, in spite of the worst assortment of elements to be had; bitter cold, stormy sky, rain. L. went to the Lost Dogs Home, but without success; we have put up notices, but hope runs low. I’ve been without letters for 2 days."
1917.11.11,"Sunday, I see, is becoming for us much what it was to our fathers, the day on which social life becomes swept; & as it’s by the nature of things a dull solemn day, the plan isn’t so bad. Still, I hardly see on what principle one can approve of our luncheon at the Webbs. L. has known them;

[In LW’s hand] I rashly said that I would occasionally write a page here & now V. calls on me to redeem my word, & as it will take me from reading Joseph Chamberlain’s speeches, I dont see why I shouldn’t. We went to the Webbs for luncheon & there too were Mr & Mrs Tawny. I had met her but not him. Before they came, the Webbs told us that he was an idealist. Now that I’ve met him the only thing which I can add with certainty is that he is an idealist with black teeth. One of the worst Webb meals to which we have been. V. between Webb & Tawny & I between Mrs W. Mrs T. Mrs W. began to talk almost at once about the Reconstruction Committee which she is on. She talked incessantly & every tenth word was “committee”. She has apparently succeeded in inventing a committee for babies, a committee for lunatics, a committee for the sick, a committee for the disabled, & a committee for the dead; but the scheme or the Cosmos is not complete because she has so far failed to invent a Committee for the Able-bodied & unemployed. However she still has hopes. Meanwhile V. at one corner, & I at another sunk in silence, while Mrs T. vacuously asked W. about the case of a woman with a broken hip in an infirmary in a Union in Walthamstow. Immediately after luncheon we fled. Took a bus from Westminster to Hammersmith, very cold but refreshing after the discourse on committees.

& when we got back here we found the room full of people—Rosalind Toynbee Arnold T. & Ka. I liked her, small, pale, with dark eyes, a wisp of hair, still, & decided in her manner. I’m not sure that I did much like him. He seemed rather more commonplace & conventional than the young man one’s used to. But we talked away briskly about art & literature; & I observed R.T. thinking, when spoken to—a good sign. As far as one can see, she is so trained in culture that she is almost a specialist; if one got to know her, I mean, one would find some carefully arranged theory netting in all her feelings about literature. For example, she doesn’t like King Lear. But, or perhaps therefore, I thought her rather distinguished, more so, at any rate than the crop-heads of Bloomsbury. As we sat, with great rolls of fur, in the shadow, I cant verify my guess as to the crop-head in her case. It struck me now & then that her half-aristocratic parentage had produced a kind of old fashioned decorum in her. Her views upon the proper relation of cooks & governesses were certainly decorous. Something I think may be due to the difference between Oxford & Cambridge. It’s strange to think how much one’s mind has been affected by this difference—even mine has, I suppose, though I was never there, & am by nature critical of them. But Arnold seemed to me not very easy to talk directly to."
1917.11.12,"Today we’ve been to London, as usually happens on Monday. We went to the Omega, & as we were looking round us, in came Roger, which embarrassed me a little, partly because of his own pictures, & also because I don’t like talking of art in front of him. He was in process of painting a table though, & disappeared. Then we went to Gordon Sqre to fetch my umbrella, 2 pictures, & a hair binder, all left there, & who should open the door but Clive? He asked us in, & there was M.H. in one of the big armchairs, a piteous half moon of a woman, to my thinking. She seems so crushed & submissive always. I half smoked a gold-tipped cigarette, & listened to some Garsington gossip. K.M. has broken with Ott. in a letter which says “You shan’t play the Countess to my cook any more” or words to that effect. We left however, & I went to Mudies, & got The Leading Note, in order to examine into R.T. more closely, & L. went on to meet Edgar for a mysterious interview; & I came home with my book, which does not seem a very masterly performance after Turgenev, I suppose; but if you dont get your touches in the right place the method is apt to be sketchy & empty. L. is at the Suffrage; & I watch 3 fireballs glowing red hot."
1917.11.13,"I must again register my complaint that people wont write to me. I dont write to them, but how can one? And no book from the Times either, for which I’m glad though, as I want to get on with my novel. The other day L. began his book, & has already done two chapters. He’s like one of those mowing machines I used to watch from my window at Asheham; round & round they go, without haste without rest, until finally the little square of corn in the middle is cut, & all is done. We began our printing off this afternoon. Our first discovery was the important one that the springs aren’t even, or the balls different in weight. We—or L.—put this more or less right, & we printed 300 copies of the first page, but we should be glad of another press, though the results are very good for the most part. A very cold day. Indeed, I might have remarked the beginning of winter. No leaves to speak of left on the trees now; a sharp chill in the air. One’s room after tea most emphatically a little centre of light in the midst of profound darkness. L. is making up a lecture he’s giving at Hammersmith; I’m to preside over the Women’s Guild."
1917.11.14,"L. gave his lecture; I presided over my guild. It always puzzles me to know why the women come, unless they like sitting in a room not their own, gas & light free, other women on other chairs. They don’t pay much attention apparently; save Mrs Langston no one has a word to offer. Tonight Mrs Allan—a rosy, bright eyed, shrewd, but not very enlightened woman spoke for an hour upon Congress. It might have been a report; & had little more interest. When she’d done, & I’d done, no questions were asked, & she started off upon food—not the food of the country, but the individual dinner & tea provided at Torquay. Upon this subject she spoke fluently & even passionately for 15 minutes. The vices of outside traders & the virtues of self control were both illustrated at length. L. was back about 10.30, after a more profitable evening at the U.D.C. where soldiers & an Indian were among the audience. Today the servants went to see Bert in hospital at Epsom; L. went to the Dogs Home, with no result; & finally we walked towards Kew, & noticed how the great chestnut trees [were] as black and bare as iron. A dozen men stand fishing in the quiet water beneath the lock—a cheerful sign of undiminished stability. We looked in, & spent half an hour, talking to the little printer, who has 2 machines & 1 press for sale. The difficulty is to decide; but probably we shall buy one, & leave the refinements of perfection for the present, which Riddell thinks necessary, but presumably can’t provide. Besides, these machines are running & only cost £14 or £15.

Again a day of no letters."
1917.11.15,"Again a day of no letters, unless I can count my weekly reprimand in the Supt. for what I said or didn’t say about Arnold’s poems about nature. This time I’m almost inclined to answer useless though it is, but I should like to protest against this flood of Oxford superiority. We printed off another page, very successfully, which took till tea time, & then we went round in the semi-darkness to the little printer, who will come round any moment now to see the room for the press. One little boy about the size of Julian works for him. Yesterday his cellar was flooded by the ladies bath next door. He is very precise in his language: perhaps the result of a semi-literary profession."
1917.11.19,"The little printer came round at the end of the last page, & stayed perhaps 1 hour—until Lottie had to ring the bell with meaning, but as I don’t suppose he dines himself, the meaning may have been obscure. We have advanced £10, & for that bought the cutting press, & stipulated that the printing press shall be here by Jan. 14th. The difficulty about these people is their flow of language; personal history must be told at length: I believe its a form of good manners. On Friday we went to a concert, walking out when the English piece came on into a disreputable side street clinging to the back of Bond St—reminds one rather of a Thackeray novel—a place for the footman of the great to gamble in. Tea at Spikings, with some of the upper classes; who looked like pet dogs threatened with a cold bath. They were talking of the scarcity of motor cars. I bought a pair of stockings & then home.

The stockings were in preparation for Garsington. We came back from that adventure 2 hours ago. It’s difficult to give the whole impression, save that it wasnt much unlike my imagination. People strewn about in a sealingwax coloured room: Aldous Huxley toying with great round disks of ivory & green marble—the draughts of Garsington: Brett in trousers; Philip tremendously encased in the best leather; Ottoline, as usual, velvet & pearls; 2 pug dogs. Lytton semi-recumbent in a vast chair. Too many nick nacks for real beauty, too many scents, & silks, & a warm air which was a little heavy. Droves of people moved about from room to room—from drawing room to dining room, from dining room to Ottoline’s room—all Sunday. At moments the sense of it seemed to flag; & the day certainly lasted very long by these means. Fredegond was admitted in the morning; & then after tea I had perhaps an hour over a log fire with Ottoline. Going for a walk we ran into a motor full of speckled & not prepossessing young men—one I entirely forget, but he existed, as I counted 4. The most obvious was Evan Morgan, a little red absurdity, with a beak of a nose, no chin, & a general likeness to a very callow but student Bantam cock, who has run to legs & neck. However he was evidently most carefully prepared to be a poet & an eccentricity, both by his conversation, which aimed at irresponsible brilliance, & lack of reticence, & by his clothes, which must have been copied from the usual Shelley picture. But he was as innocent as a chicken & so foolish that it didn’t seem to matter. On the whole I liked Ottoline better than her friends have prepared one for liking her. Her vitality seemed to me a credit to her, & in private talk her vapours give way to some quite clear bursts of shrewdness. The horror of the Garsington situation is great of course; but to the outsider the obvious view is that O. & P. & Garsington house provide a good deal, which isn’t accepted very graciously. However to deal blame rightly in such a situation is beyond the wit of a human being: they’ve brought themselves to such a pass of intrigue & general intricacy of relationship that they’re hardly sane about each other. In such conditions I think Ott. deserves some credit for keeping her ship in full sail, as she certainly does. We were made immensely comfortable; a good deal of food; the talk had frequent bare patches, but then this particular carpet had been used fairly often. By talking severely to Philip, L. made him come up to Parliament today. He is a weak amiable long suffering man, who seems generally to be making the best of things, & seeing the best of people whom by nature he dislikes. We came home by Oxford (where I bought 2 writing books, & L. bought a pipe, & we had coffee, & saw the colleges) then to Reading, where we lunched; then to Ealing, where we changed to Richmond. On the top of our return, Alix appeared, & has just left; but I missed most of her, feeling it necessary to have a bath."
1917.11.22,"I boasted so much about this book & the charm of filling it from a never exhausted fount at Garsington that I’m ashamed to miss days; & yet as I point out, the only chance it has is to wait one’s mood. Ottoline keeps one by the way, devoted however to her “inner life”; which made me reflect that I haven’t an inner life. She read me a passage in my praise though, so the realities do come in sometimes. On Tuesday L. went to Williams & Norgate, who offer terms for a 2/6 book—which must be considered. Evidently they want him very much; & can’t altogether conceal this in spite of their wish to drive a hard bargain. I rather think I finished taking down a page. Anyhow on Wednesday Barbara came to make a start, & the machine thereupon completely struck work, one of the rollers being cut, & jibbing, & as our stock of K’s ran out, she could only set 4 lines. This she did however, quickly & without fault, so that she promises well. She bicycled from Wimbledon, her small crop head, bright cheeks, brilliant waistcoat give her a likeness to some vivacious bird; but I don’t know that I think this very emphatic appearance particularly interesting. It always seems to say “Now all the decks are cleared for action” & action there is none.

I dined with Roger & met Clive. We sat at the low square table covered with a bandanna, & eat out of dishes each holding a different bean or lettuce: delicious food for a change. We drank wine, & finished with soft white cheese, eaten with sugar. Then, taking a splendid flight above personalities, we discussed literature & aesthetics.

“D’you know, Clive, I’ve made out a little more about the thing which is essential to all art: you see, all art is representative. You say the word tree, & you see a tree. Very well. Now every word has an aura. Poetry combines the different aura’s in a sequence—” That was something like it. I said one could, & certainly did, write with phrases, not only words; but that didn’t help things on much. Roger asked me if I founded my writing upon texture or upon structure; I connected structure with plot, & therefore said “texture”. Then we discussed the meaning of structure & texture in painting & in writing. Then we discussed Shakespeare, & Roger said Giotto excited him just as much. This went on till I made myself go precisely at 10. And we discussed also Chinese poetry; Clive said the whole thing was too distant to be comprehensible. Roger compared the poetry with the painting. I liked it all very much (the talk I mean). Much no doubt is perfectly vague, not to be taken seriously, but the atmosphere puts ideas into one’s head, & instead of having to curtail them, or expatiate, one can speak them straight out & be understood—indeed disagreed with. Old Roger takes a gloomy view, not of our life, but of the world’s future; but I think I detected the influence of Trotter & the herd, & so I distrusted him. Still, stepping out into Charlotte Street, where the Bloomsbury murder took place a week or two ago, & seeing a crowd swarming in the road & hearing women abuse each other & at the noise others come running with delight—all this sordidity made me think him rather likely to be right.

Today has been a perfectly warm, very still day, & we just had time after printing off a page to reach the river & see everything reflected perfectly straightly in the water. The red roof of a house had its own little cloud of red in the river—lights lit on the bridge made long streaks of yellow—very peaceful, & as if the heart of winter."
1917.11.23,"L. went up to London with the rollers, & I meant to go to Kew. On the way it struck me that one ought to decide things definitely. One ought to make up one’s mind. To begin then, I settled that if it was the 6d day at Kew I wouldn’t hesitate but decide not to go in. It was the 6d day; I turned without pausing & had therefore to walk back. Certainly this decision brings a feeling of peace, though I rather think I was wrong. It was a warm, windless day, the sky genuinely blue. I counted my lumps of sugar, 31: but Saxon came in, & took one; hadn’t slept, & so was cutting his office. I meant to read Brooke’s sermons, & couldn’t; & Saxon hadn’t much to say. We discussed the jealousy of vanity & the jealousy of affection. He is immune from both. I have the one & not the other—perhaps from lack of cause. L. came in after seeing Squire, whose insignificance takes the lustre from reviewing rather. Then came Barbara, who wanted a bath; & Saxon followed her; & then Clive came in, & we chattered away—he & I in duet for the most part—till 10.30; when he went dressed like a Newmarket gent in an immensely thick coat. I find his sprightliness a rest. No hunt for subjects needed. He is after another before the first is disposed of. He abused Ott., but frankly. He discussed Lady Mary Montagu: his reviews—a publisher has offered him £40 for a book of them. He has become rather a raconteur; but there is, I think, something intellectual about him; something of the Cambridge standard, perhaps, surviving. He’s no fool, though his manners suggest overwhelming reasons for thinking him one now & then—this perpetual effort to shine, to be ‘in the know’—this vanity. A long talk with M.H. on the telephone interrupted him. He has become a great writer of intimate letters He makes a business of knowing everyone, or at any rate their affairs; but I like this."
1917.11.24,"Today Saturday the usual reasons have kept me recumbent; in the mitigated form which allows setting up & distributing. Barbara brought the new rollers. She lunched & stayed to tea, & has indeed only gone a short time, which wont, I hope become a habit."
1917.11.26,"I dont like Sunday; the best thing is to make it a work day, & to unravel Brooke’s mind to the sound of church bells was suitable enough. Such a wind in the night, by the way, that the milkman reported much damage down the road this morning, & raised our hopes, which were dashed on going out to see nothing smashed—not a stain of blood, or even the remnant of a hat. It was fine & wet by turns, with a high cold wind continuously. We went to Kew, & saw a blazing bush, as red as cherry blossom, but more intense—frostily red—also gulls rising & falling for pieces of meat, their crowd waved aside suddenly by three very elegant light grey cranes. We also went into the orchid house where these sinister reptiles live in a tropical heat, so that they come out in all their spotted & streaked flesh even now in the cold. They always make me anxious to bring them into a novel. L. went on to Hampstead, & I back here; where I had tea in the kitchen with the Manx cat. L. saw Margaret & discussed labour I suppose. & his book. I wish my range extended so far.

Today I went into London with my ms: & Leonard went to Harrisons. (which entry was broken off somehow—but my recollection is that L. found Desmond at the L.L.: together they look up the word f——in the slang dictionary, & were saddened & surprised to see how the thumb marks of members were thick on the page. My afternoon was by comparison chaste; though I’m hardly proud of the fact that I completely lost my way in seeking Printing House Square, & got into a maze of little half lit, very busy & professional looking streets which I should like to investigate. The profession of journalism has its heart here; carts were standing lengthwise for bales to be dumped into. A kind man in uniform, something at a warehouse he told me, took me to the Times at last; though I (still managed to miss my way, I think it must have been, for I remember walking rapidly in the wrong direction, which got darker & darker until I became suspicious & went back again—but this is a week old)."
1917.12.03,"Its impossible to remember a week at a stretch, which I must confess would be my task if I were to pretend to be accurate. One day I went to the dentist; & we had Barbara here for 3 days, with disastrous results, for when we looked at her work, it was so full of faults we had to take it down. I should have expected, not much intelligence, but the quickness & accuracy of a good needlewoman. This was annoying. On Saturday L. gave a lecture at Hampstead. Strange what a stamp Hampstead sets even on a casual gathering of 30 people; such clean, decorous, uncompromising & high minded old ladies & old gentlemen; & the young wearing brown clothes, & thinking seriously, the women dowdy, the men narrow shouldered; bright fire & lights & books surrounding us, & everyone of course agreeing beforehand to what was said. Old Dr Clark indeed could quote clauses in Treaties by their numbers; & Hobson was shrewd, judicious & kindly; Janet came in looking very well. But we had to race off in the Tube to Leicester Sqre to dine with Barbara Saxon & a young woman called G. Then on to Figaro at the Old Vic. It’s perfectly lovely; breaking from one beauty into another, & so romantic as well as witty—the perfection of music, & vindication of opera.

On Sunday we heard of Cecil’s death, & Philip’s wounds.

We walked along the river in the afternoon, when L. came back from Staines, & came to an old hollow elm tree, in the sawdust of which someone so we guessed, had stuck a match. The wind was blowing in, & soon the flames were running high. A crowd stopped. The first old gentleman was so positive that I believed him; he said it was a usual process, done to get rid of an old tree; nothing to marvel at; no question of accident or malice; & so he marched on with obvious contentment. The second old gentleman admitted doubts, finally swung round to our view that no one would burn a tree down on the public path on a Sunday too. Meanwhile the tree burnt rather beautifully; we called at the police office & told them, in case the fire might run along by means of bushes to other trees. Leonard’s cold very bad—a horrid nuisance.

Today he stayed in & set up 21 lines. I went to Harrison, to Mudies, to the Times, with an article on Mrs Drew, & am just come in. Frostily cold night; stars polished to their brightest: so much brighter than the streets are. I lost my way again, & as no one knows where Printing House Sqre is, one has full scope for wandering in. I got the 2nd vol. of Ld Morley’s memories, a real solid book, I think, like the books father used to buy, looking like them too, an ugly red. One night Walter Lamb dropped in, as we sat over the fire; & his proud crest is a little dashed I think by my overpowering snobbery."
1917.12.05,"Our apprentice weighs rather heavily upon us. For one thing, though I’m always ashamed in her presence to feel this, her presence is rather in the way of our complete comfort. It may be her youth; something highly polished so as to reflect without depth about her—On the other hand, she’s nice, considerate; one can be open with her. The real drawback is her work. Today has been spent by L. in the futile misery of trying to print from one of her pages which wont lock up. As the other page had to be entirely taken down & re-set, her work amounts to nil; less than nil, considering L.’s time wasted. A bitter cold day too. Our only outing after dark to the printers to borrow inverted comma’s. Yesterday L. saw Philip at Fishmonger’s Hall. I set up in one room, Barbara in the other. These days indoors don’t provide much in the way of incident, & pass with the swiftest rush, so that at 9 o’clock, the present hour, one seems only starting on the days work—perhaps the result of passing without question straight from one occupation to another. L. reading Life of Dilke; worried by a flea up his back; I’m past the middle of Purgatorio, but find it stiff, the meaning more than the language, I think. We got Hardy’s new poems, but lent them to Philip."
1917.12.06,"When I wrote that we were only at the beginning of our days work, last night, I spoke more truly than I knew. Nothing was further from our minds than air raids; a bitter night, no moon up till eleven. At 5 however, I was wakened by L. to a most instant sense of guns: as if one’s faculties jumped up fully dressed. We took clothes, quilts, a watch & a torch, the guns sounding nearer as we went down stairs to sit with the servants on the ancient black horse hair chest wrapped in quilts in the kitchen passage. Lottie having said she felt bad, passed on to a general rattle of jokes & comments which almost silenced the guns. They fired very quickly, apparently towards Barnes. Slowly the sounds got more distant, & finally ceased; we unwrapped ourselves & went back to bed. In ten minutes there could be no question of staying there: guns apparently at Kew. Up we jumped, more hastily this time, since I remember leaving my watch, & trailing cloak & stockings behind me. Servants apparently calm & even jocose. In fact one talks through the noise, rather bored by having to talk at 5 a.m. than anything else. Guns at one point so loud that the whistle of the shell going up followed the explosion. One window did, I think, rattle. Then silence. Cocoa was brewed for us, & off we went again. Having trained one’s ears to listen one can’t get them not to for a time; & as it was after 6, carts were rolling out of stables, motor cars throbbing, & then prolonged ghostly whistlings which meant, I suppose, Belgian work people recalled to the munitions factory. At last in the distance I heard bugles; L. was by this time asleep, but the dutiful boy scouts came down our road & wakened him carefully; it struck me how sentimental the suggestion of the sound was, & how thousands of old ladies were offering up their thanksgivings at the sound, & connecting him (a boy scout with small angel wings) with some joyful vision—And then I went to sleep: but the servants sat up with their heads out of the window in the bitter cold—frost white on the roofs—until the bugle sounded, when they went back to the kitchen and sat there till breakfast. The logic of the proceeding escapes me.

Today we have printed, & discussed the raid, which, according to the Star I bought was the work of 25 Gothas, attacking in 5 squadrons & 2 were brought down. A perfectly still & fine winter’s day, so about J.30-tomorrow morning perhaps—"
1917.12.07,"But there was no raid; & as the moon wanes, no doubt we are free for a month. Happily no apprentice today, which gives a sense of holiday. We have had to make it rather clear to Barbara that this job may not be followed by another. She refuses payment for last week. So there’s no fault to find with her. No one could be nicer; & yet she has the soul of the lake, not of the sea. Or is one too romantic & exacting in what one expects? Anyhow, nothing is more fascinating than a live person; always changing, resisting & yeilding against one’s forecast; this is true even of Barbara, not the most variable or gifted of her kind. Nessa was up about a governess (Mrs Brereton suggested in place of the faultfinding & man-hunting Miss E.) so I ended ray afternoon in one of the great soft chairs at Gordon Square. I like the sense of space & deep large pattern one gets there. I sat alone for 20 minutes, reading a book on Children & Sex. When Nessa came we had tea & it was discovered that Clive & Mary were in the house; & Norton came in, the same party as usual. As usual to my liking; so much alive, so full of information of the latest kind; real interest in every sort of art; & in people too. I rather expect L. to disagree with all this. I judge by the amount of animation of brain produced in myself, & sense of thoughts all liberated. Not that M.H. open her lips, but she has an air of mute sympathy. I like Norton too—all that brain hoarded in his head for the most exalted ends, which makes his criticism always impartial. Clive starts his topics—lavishing admiration & notice upon Nessa, which doesn’t make me jealous as once it did, when the swing of that pendulum carried so much of my fortune with it: at any rate of my comfort. Maynard says that Bonar Law has dished the Government; the country entirely with Lansdowne, & the Government unable to stick to its own declarations. This was from Lord Reading. It sometimes occurs to me that there’s not a single secret in politics; everything is to be guessed from the newspapers. Nessa had to go round to Rogers, & I walked with her, buying sausages & cheese for a supper party on the way. Roger is becoming one of the successes of the day as a painter of perfectly literal & very unpleasant portraits.

Today (Saturday) we walked to Twickenham, where Leonard took train for Staines. I found Marny when I got back. Its 6.30 & she has just gone; so that if I don’t cover the next 10 pages with family gossip & detail of all sorts its not for want of it. Let me put a little of it down, if I can remember—but it goes so fast, & turns to ashes without the atmosphere. But Florence Bishop, married to a naval Dr lives in a flat in Earls Court—gives you Tiptree jam for tea, & looks like a picture, & is very poor, owing to old Bishop’s failings; but her husband is an elderly man, & now takes charge of wounded soldiers in trains. And we haven’t had butter for a long time, & sometimes we can’t even get the nice kind of margarine, but I wont deal at Barkers, not after the evidence at that fire. Wright’s Coal shed burnt down behind us the other night—all that coal wasted, & once last winter we’d run out. It was a Saturday too, & I went from shop to shop begging even a scuttlefull, & who should I meet at Knightsbridge but Kitty Maxse? & she said O I’ll give you coal—why I’ve got 2 cellars full: & sure enough that very afternoon up she drove in a taxi with a sack full, & that saw us through, but I’ve not seen her since that day, so distinguished looking, & not a year older, though she must be 50. Well, I’m 35; & Toad 43—but one forgets peoples’ ages, & I’m sure I don’t feel old; & you look like 25—And Nessa as lovely as ever I suppose! (here followed the whole history of Nessa, Clive, Duncan, Adrian & ourselves).

Dear me, how we all move about—partly owing to the war to be sure; though I do see some of my old friends still, like Miss Harris, who paints, you know, & very well too, but she wont show anything because she only considers herself an amateur, & she’s very busy now with war work. And Hilda Lightbody, I see her; though she’s making papier maché splints all day—yes, a widow she is, her husband having been a great invalid—And I sometimes see Adeline, who lives with Hervey, at Hastings for the winter, not having meant to stay there, but they went for a change & there wasn’t any reason why they shouldn’t stay—near the sea, of course; & Millicent not very far off. Millicent’s boy died you know, & Virginia milks cows at Lord Rayleigh’s place in Essex. She prefers horses, but she couldn’t get horses, & she’s very fond of cows. Yes Millicent still lives at Hastings, though she doesn’t like it, but Vere does, because of the sea & they know a great many people, & Millicent got up a series of dances for young people last winter, though she didn’t feel like dancing I’m sure, & she keeps the musical Festival going, though she won’t do any war work; & Augusta always loved Kent, & now theyve got a house in Kent, & a little garden, & Bob works for a neighbour sometimes, & so they get along you know—all the children out in the world now. O its wicked how they grow up—Halford quite a big boy—with a poetic side, but very practical I’m glad to say, & Janet very like Madge; & I wish Madge would write. Perhaps she’d be happier then, though I don’t think Madge could ever be really happy, but its a wonderful piece of work, & I’m sure Will owes her a great deal. I dont think I’ve gossiped so much for years. And Cousin Mia dead, & Aunt Mary killed—yes. That was extremely sad, but better than a lingering illness I daresay! And Herbert in all the papers; but Lettice doesn’t like London at all, but Herbert does, & she goes back to Sheffield for change of air—& when the raids come, we go & sit with the Wales’ on the ground floor. But they ought to tell one about the Bugles. Why, when they first blew, I thought it might be the Germans themselves, & I went out onto the landing & met a lady, though it was 2, dressed for going out, & she told me—&c &c——
"
1917.12.10,"Today was a string of meetings for L. Out to lunch, to Philip, to another meeting & not back till 8.30; I pacing the room in some anxiety till I heard him. My afternoon was very nearly normal; to Mudies, tea in an A.B.C. reading a life of Gaudier Brzeska; home again; wet soft vaporous day."
1917.12.11,"The infliction of our apprentice. Things on the whole went better; & L. & I slipped out for half an hour before tea, into the brownish red light of the wintry afternoon. The green gives a very good sample of the sky & bare trees, one or two old rooks nests in the upper twigs. Back to tea; & Perera came for private talk. I own that I sounded the very depths of boredom with Barbara. She gives out facts precisely as she received them—minute facts about governesses & houses. And no doubt of her own adequacy crosses her mind; all so nice, honest, sensible, how can there be a flaw? Indeed, one figures her nature as a flawless marble, impervious, unatmospheric. And the time passed; she missed her train; waited on for another—waited until 6.10; & we were to dine at 7—& my evening fretted away without sensation, save of one standing under the drip of a water spout. My excuse for such extravagance is that I had to go in to the Guild today. No speaker came, & we were clearing the table at 9 after a lot of letter reading & intermittent discussion when a private omen came true. The speaker arrived. A Mrs Moore from Kensal Rise: middle class; dressed in velvet; vulgar, fluent. Spoke on propaganda for 20 minutes; more words than brain, & indeed she couldn’t explain her sayings to the satisfaction of Mrs Langston, & was perturbed when I showed how much I knew. But I admired the way in which she got her steam up when we were all anxious to go. The women said it was a splendid speech; sentences that melt into each other impress them."
1917.12.12,"A melancholy record—The truth is, when we’re not printing & therefore don’t have Barbara here, we do jobs in London, & get back late & I’m disinclined to get out pen & ink. On Sunday Lytton came to tea. I was alone, for L. went to Margaret. I enjoyed it very much. He is one of the most supple of our friends; I don’t mean passionate or masterful or original, but the person whose mind seems softest to impressions, least starched by any formality or impediment. There is his great gift of expression of course, never (to me) at its best in writing; but making him in some respects the most sympathetic & understanding friend to talk to. Moreover, he has become, or now shows it more fully, curiously gentle, sweet tempered, considerate; & if one adds his peculiar flavour of mind, his wit & infinite intelligence—not brain but intelligence—he is a figure not to be replaced by any other combination. Intimacy seems to me possible with him as with scarcely any one; for, besides tastes in common, I like & think I understand his feelings—even in their more capricious developments; for example in the matter of Carrington. He spoke of her, by the way, with a candour not flattering, though not at all malicious.

“That woman will dog me”—he remarked. “She won’t let me write, I daresay.”

“Ottoline was saying you would end by marrying her.”

“God! the mere notion is enough—One thing I know—I’ll never marry anyone—”

“But if she’s in love with you?”

“Well, then she must take her chance.”

“I believe I’m sometimes jealous—”

“Of her? thats inconceivable—”

“You like me better, dont you?”

He said he did; we laughed; remarked on our wish for an intimate correspondent; but how to overcome the difficulties? Should we attempt it? Perhaps.

He brought us his Gordon. Next day he was to take the book to Chatto & Windus.

This morning ruined by the tears & plaints of Lottie, who thinks her work too hard, & finally demanded higher wages, which she could easily get, & so could Nell. I lost my temper, & told her to get them then. Up came Nelly in a conciliatory mood regretting Lottie’s outburst; though pointing out the hardships of our printing-room, so untidy—work endless; had meant to ask a rise in February—everyone’s wages raised—Of course we had to pay extra for food, but then we’d got to—We were very amicable; no difficulty about money; but L.’s taunts seemed to me unpleasant—I charged her to find out the truth—if there is such a thing in the midst of that bluster—At last she went. Walked by the river having done a little printing."
1917.12.13,"By careful arrangement I limited the reconciliation scene with Lottie to 15 minutes at eleven sharp. She sobbed; repented; took back everything she’d said; told me how her temper had led to constant rows at “Frys” as they call it; all a fabrication about over work, & the more people we had & the more mess we made the better she liked it. She begged me not to tell anyone; she kissed me & went off, like a chastened child, leaving me with a mixture of pity & (I suppose) self complacency. The poor have no chance; no manners or self control to protect themselves with; we have a monopoly of all the generous feelings—(I daresay this isn’t quite true; but there’s some meaning [in] it. Poverty degrades, as Gissing said). Barbara had a cold & didn’t come, to my relief certainly. But that’s inaccurate; she came after luncheon, & brought a letter from Nessa who invites her to be governess there for a month, pending Mrs Brereton. Barbara was so sensible, & matter of fact that I repented & certainly she treats us with the strictest honesty, making a serious undertaking of the printing (here the light went out) which is creditable, & one could depend upon her, I fancy, to keep the exact letter of her promise. She went off directly after tea to conduct one of those curious gatherings of Nick, Oliver, & Saxon & Carrington about their house in the country. The work of furnishing has fallen of course upon Carrington; but Barbara is a good second & keeps the accounts, which will end, I assured her, by absorbing all her money on things she’ll never be paid for."
1917.12.14,"Today we went to see Philip at Fishmongers Hall. Rather a strange place a few feet from London Bridge. A pompous hall, with a porter, a gigantic fire for that porter, a German gun; & within banisters draped with crimson folds of stuff, as if for a royal visit; Nelson’s flag in a glass case; Dick Whittington in plaster standing in an alcove; a branching staircase taking one to a great gallery now divided into cubicles. Two or three nurses sat sewing outside. We found Philip up; his chair by the open window, looking into the street, which was noisy, & just catching sight of the river. I saw a notice warning patients not to throw cigarette ends out, or they might catch inflammable bales upon the wharf. To me, Philip looked well; though there was that absentmindedness which one sees in Nick. I suppose to Philip these days pass in a dream from which he finds himself detached. I can imagine that he is puzzled why he doesn’t feel more. He still talks of “we” & “our” things. I thought he must look to going back again with something like hope. But he talked very easily & cheerfully—about horses & books & so on—Another man—a great burly cavalry officer was reading his book in a far corner; unused to reading books, I should think. Nurses seemed very kindly. A feeling of the uselessness of it all, breaking these people & mending them again, was in the air, I thought. We asked Philip to Asheham, when he can move.

Home to find Sidney [Waterlow] already in the chair by the fire. He was in very good feather, & rolled out the word “I” with a sort of tremor of pride; he has indeed negotiated treaties in Paris since we met. Being self conscious & diffident his triumphs give him enormous pleasure; there is the same tremor of half incredulous self approbation in his tone when he talks of his children. I laughed at him about our quarrel. He had thought it all over, so he said—as if it mattered; & was highly pleased by the removal of the cloud. Saxon came, very late, to dinner. I gave it him, & he told me how selfish Alix was—can’t pack her own boxes; waits for Carrington. Saxon attributes this to love; I believe its in imitation of the beloved. She has picked it up from James, sees it in him & thinks it stands for the consciousness of superiority, I believe. Sydney stayed the night; & Saxon stayed till eleven; & he only spoke 3 times; & then rather pedantically, in his old way, which he has rather dropped lately."
1917.12.15,"A cold but sunny day. It seems long since we had a day to ourselves. No printing done. We took a walk in the old style through the Park, down the avenue & back by the river, which was flooding up fast, & cut us off, making us creep along a railing so as to reach dry land. The streets remind me of Cambridge streets. People walk down the middle. This is partly because of the queues waiting to buy at Liptons. One has some difficulty in keeping on the pavement, & the motor buses are always grazing people’s sides. Home & a large tea by ourselves. Masses of papers. Perera, of course, to consult one more; & he is still sitting with L. in his room."
1917.12.17,"Monday, as I think I’ve noted before, is our marketing day—but I’m forgetting Molly MacCarthy & Walter Lamb last night—The thing arose in this way. Wat offered us the loan of his Norfolk maps. Thinking it a little cool to borrow without invitation, we asked him to bring them. We then found ourselves faced with the unbearable prospect of unmitigated Walter. But who to get at the last moment? The Strachey household denuded owing to Tidmarsh; Squire engaged; at last the idea of Molly came to me, & Heaven granted this favour. I’m not sure that her deafness doesn’t lend her a kind of piquancy (like a stammer); she——"
1918.01.03,"I forget who it was that came in at this moment; & I have excuse for forgetting, since it is now Thursday, 3rd Jan. 1918. & we’re just back from Asheham. I remember though that the last days were full of people. Walter & Molly as I began to relate—She has sent her novel to Chatto & Windus, & calls it The Band on the Pier, or Ring Fence. The last dull I think. W.L. spruce & a little suspicious when the Royal Family appeared, as it did; wouldn’t shoot at those rabbits again for my diversion. And then I can remember that we had Ka; who contemplates resignation; & then, the night after, Bob; with his pockets bulging with Georgian poetry, his talk all of books & prices asked for printing, & number of copies sold, in the midst of which Nelly burst in to say that the Take Cover had sounded. So we had our dinner partly in the cellar; Bob talking at such a rate that it was necessary to listen at the window for the guns, loud enough though they were. I remember him attached to a large plate of suet pudding in the basement, & L. sitting on a wooden box in the coal hole reading the paper & finding one of my red pens there. All clear sounded about 10: a bad raid, though, & Barbara & Saxon suffered more than we did at Hampstead.

After that—the very next night—we went to the 17 Club dinner; a great deal of eating by some 200 people at long tables. Waiters thudding swing doors imitated guns so successfully that various officials came round & warned one of a raid. Jos.[Wedgwood] made a speech. I noticed poor Marjorie listening with her eyes on her lap. She came up from Darlington, & was dressed, poor creature, in muslin picked out with red roses & cut low; though every one else was more or less in working clothes, & fur capes. I was caught in the net of Sylvia Whitham, who cross examined me about her husbands novels; & in despair of revealing my true opinion I pretended never to have read Wolfgang—Most suitably, of all our friends shes the one to have a bomb dropped next door, & to receive it without surprise. And she’s taking to literature, & begins by translating Flaubert—a remarkable instance of a person without gift of any kind, always pushing along in the wake of other more advanced people.

Next day we went to Asheham, & the journey was the worst in our record—5 hours; spent mostly outside Clapham Junction; fog, bitter cold; every move stopping short in a minute or two. Motored out, I remember, & found the roads under snow; but very pleasant coming into the drawing room, save that we were without milk.

One of the coldest & finest of Christmases. Rather to our relief, we spent it alone, Ray falling ill, Ka coming for week end, & Nessa’s children. There was the usual visit from Maynard & Clive; my usual failure to get to Charleston corresponding to Nessa’s failure to get to Asheham. I spent a night there, & enjoyed [?] myself, through the rather obtuse barrier of poor Bunny, who took to his bed at one point, without sympathy from Nessa, who had often put him to bed, she said, for no perceivable cause. Duncan came back from London, with gossip for us; chiefly about Alix & a party at the play, who broke the partition dropped cigarettes, & had to be asked to leave. But what I like most about Asheham is that I read books there; so divine it is, coming in from a walk to have tea by the fire & then read & read—say Othello—say anything. It doesn’t seem to matter what. But one’s faculties are so oddly clarified that the page detaches itself in its true meaning & lies as if illumined, before one’s eyes; seen whole & truly not in jerks & spasms as so often in London. And then the trees, spare & leafless; the brown of the plough, &, yesterday, downs mountainous through a mist, which isn’t palpable, for only dead detail vanishes & the live grows larger & larger, & fires can be seen burning through. Solitary sportsmen beat up duck & snipe on the marshes. Windows were almost always frozen in the morning, & each blade rough with frost. Partridges would come & sit in the field, lifeless little lumps they looked, half stiff with cold perhaps.

The diary habit has come to life at Charleston. Bunny sat up late on the Old Year’s night writing, & Duncan came back with a ledger, bought in Lambs Conduit Street. The sad thing is that we daren’t trust each other to read our books; they lie, like vast consciences, in our most secret drawers. Clive, by the way, enlivened Christmas by a small book of verse—the prose fantastically foppish, the verse very pretty & light, to my mind (by wh. I mean not altogether to L.’s mind). He can do his little Owl very efficiently—Anyhow, I prefer it to the last Georgian effort—bound in blue this year, & housing that ridiculous Squire.

So we come to an end of the year, & any attempt to sum it up is beyond me, or even to cast a final glance at the evening paper, with news from Russia, which has just come in and drawn L. to remark

“A very interesting state of things—”

“And what’s going to happen?”

“No human being can foretell that.”

The End"
1918.01.04,"There’s no reason after all why one should expect special events for the first page of a new book; still one does: & so I may count three facts of different importance; our first use of the 17 Club; talk of peace; & the breaking of my tortoiseshell spectacles. This talk of peace (after all the most important of the three) comes to the surface with a kind of tremor of hope once in 3 months; then subsides; then swells again. What it now amounts to, one doesn’t even like to guess, having a sort of superstition about guessing; at any rate, one can’t help feeling something moving; one may wake to find the covered murmur proclaimed in every newspaper. The 17 Club is a success, on the basis of one tea. We met Alix, settled in, already an habitué by the fire; together with a knot of very youthful revolutionaries, one officer, & two sallow democratic officials. The rooms are light, bear traces of Omega, & are less formal than usual. Before this, I did my usual round; Partridge & Coopers; walk through Lincolns Inn Fields to Mudies; L. passing his afternoon in Committees. Margaret has just rung up to consult him on certain peace maneuvres in which she figures. Talk with Alix about possible books she might write: “One’s wretched without work”—“Oh, perfectly wretched” she echoed, with a glance in the direction of James, I suppose. “No hope of writing well: I see things as they are.”"
1918.01.05,"We went to Hampton Court, for the first time since we skated there, so I believe. We walked across Bushey Park, & a troop of horses took the opportunity to run from one side to the other. The gilt statue was surrounded by ice, & the ice had an inch of water on it; I broke through with my umbrella.. The beds at Hampton Court are uniformly brown, save for one yellow & one pink flower, primula’s I think. There were sacks at intervals, which L. thought might be laid down for the gymnastic exercises of Mrs Creighton. We looked in at her windows. As usual we saw nothing but those great vellum folios, containing Italian History, so I suppose. We walked along a raised bank beneath trees to the river; & sat on one of the semi-circle of empty wooden seats. It was cold, but still. Then we took a tram to Kingston & had tea at Atkinsons, where one may have no more than a single bun. Everything is skimped now. Most of the butchers shops are shut; the only open shop was besieged. You can’t buy chocolates, or toffee; flowers cost so much that I have to pick leaves, instead. We have cards for most foods. The only abundant shop windows are the drapers. Other shops parade tins, or cardboard boxes, doubtless empty. (This is an attempt at the concise, historic style.) Suddenly one has come to notice the war everywhere. I suppose there must be some undisturbed pockets of luxury somewhere still—up in Northumbrian or Cornish farm houses perhaps; but the general table is pretty bare. Papers, however, flourish, & by spending 6d we are supplied with enough to light a weeks fires. A man called Richardson works out a highly complex mathematical method of voting in the trenches."
1918.01.06,"An infernal wet day. I left L. at the station, he having to go to Hampstead to answer a list of questions for Margaret. Home to tea alone. Alix & Fredegond for supper. The talk, after flaunting round Clive, Barbara, Garsington &c. settled upon conscience: social duties, & Tolstoy. Gerald [Shove] read Tolstoy the other day, & determined to give up tobacco, but now argues that Tolstoy’s commands were for men of looser life than he, so that he may smoke cigarettes. He thinks seriously of starting a nursery garden after the war, & threatens to give up their capital.

“What’s the use of that? L. demanded. Thats the worst of all things to do. We dont want people to live on 30/ a week.”

“Psychologically it may be necessary if one is to abolish capitalism” I remarked.

“I dont agree.” said Alix. “Besides who would he give his capital to?”

“In the ideal state everyone would have £300 a year” L. went on.

“Please tell me some reason that I can remember to take back to Gerald” Fredegond pleaded.

I forget now what the reason was.

“He’s got an awful conscience, she continued. He ate a large Christmas dinner, & then he & his brother sent out for preserved fruit & when they had finished them they were miserable. “We’ve behaved like pigs! We’re brutes!” they cried. They were both miserable.” L. gave us a great many reasons why we should keep what we have, & do good work for nothing; I still feel, however, that my fire is too large for one person. I’m one of those who are hampered by the psychological hindrance of owning capital. Alix represented some sturdy & hardheaded economy, derived from Strachey’s. After this long argument, it was time for them to go."
1918.01.07,"To London today, L. with my Jack’s article to the Times, I to Spiller about my spectacles; & I must get a new pair at a cost of £2.2. After that we met at the London Library, & then to tea at the Club; where Alix almost plays hostess; & the woman still smokes her pipe in the corner. Lytton came in, & I finished my tea with him. He is bargaining with Chatto & Windus about his book.

“When I’m asked if I like Tidmarsh, I say the country suits me”, he said, rather cryptically.

His mild benignancy with the young ladies—Fredegond, Faith & Alix, very noticeable. I told him he wrote too much after the pattern of Macaulay.

“I see you didn’t really like Gordon” he said.

He was quite unmoved, contented, almost sleek. People going in & out all the time make it difficult to talk. Chief topic the approach of peace; save that the evening papers throw doubts upon it.
"
1918.01.08,"As a sign of the times we live in, I note that Fredegond who wants to spend some months in London is advised by her practical friends to live in a hotel. They say that she would have difficulty in getting food, even if she found a servant, or a room to live in. Consequently, she is taking rooms at the Thackeray Hotel.

Some fragments came to mind today which, having nothing to record, I may as well put down. How I went to a Registry Office for Nessa; & noticed that the woman had 6 or 7 pens on her table, tried one after another, found all save one unusable; nibs stuck to the holder with crusts of ink. One night last summer getting down from a bus, I saw a fish bag left on the seat, & gave it to the woman in front of me. She thanked me & said, with half a smirk, “That comes of me not being used to carrying a bag”. The bag was evidently the mark of a lower social scale. There were of course other fragments, which at hint of needing them dissolve in my mind. Its odd, considering their triviality, how these little scenes come up again & again at odd moments: are thought of, re-enacted, & disappear. Odd too how one thinks by help of pictures of surroundings. Yesterday I couldn’t remember whether I’d left a book in my room. And then I saw myself moving my spectacles, & remembered that I moved my spectacles in order to put the book down: sure enough there it was. I’d give a good deal to know something of psychology. That was one of the books I suggested that Alix should write: but “whats the good if one can’t do it really well?” To the Printers [McDermott] today, & find him calmly asserting that he really can’t send the Press on the 14th. Can’t find anyone to move it. This is cool as he took our £10 on the understanding we should have the press without fail. However, these chilly half animate overworked little creatures can’t be taken seriously. They don’t attach the same meaning to promises, even written & stamped promises, that we do. People badgering him with small jobs, he said, & hasn’t even the time to claim his money. For the first time for weeks or months I spent a whole afternoon shopping. Coppers accumulate in my purse, parcels hang from every finger; shop people cross; shops crowded: in fact a most disagreeable duty, when done in a mass."
1918.01.09,"The 17 Club is something of a lure; certainly promises better conditions for tea than a shop. So, having gone for my spectacles, I went to Gerrard Street. Found Fredegond & Faith there, also a large semi-circle of Cambridge youths; including a young man with a flop of hair who had written a play, which he had with him; the pipe-smoking girl, & one or two others. I was amused at the repetition of certain old scenes from my own past—the obvious excitement, & sense of being the latest & best (though not outwardly the most lovely) of God’s works, of having things to say for the first time in history; there was all this; & the young men so wonderful in the eyes of the young women, & young women so desirable in the eyes of the young men, though this was not perceptible to me sitting elderly upon my sofa—This sort of talk—

“Ah, but have you read his play? & do you approve?”

“Most decidedly I do.”

“And you like the handling.”

“Oh immensely!”

Then a second, less favoured young woman, leans forward & says,

“But may I see it?”

“Certainly” says the youth, & produces it from a despatch box, to the girl’s delight.

“I represent the public. Edith’s so unconventional.”

However, then I was summoned to have my tea at the far end of the room; & Lytton came in, carrying Lord Morley, whom he’s reviewing for L. We tried still to overhear young Cambridge, & L⁠[ytton]. finally decamped, on my daring him, to that party, now grown even larger by the addition of several young men with large foreheads, hair combed back, in hiding from the police.

I then had some private talk with Faith. According to her Nick is getting a great deal of pain from the Saxon Barbara Nick combination. His claims are disregarded; Barbara prefers Saxon; & seems to be ashamed of the unintellectuality of Nick. She wont take him to see her Bloomsbury friends. Bloomsbury, I think, will have one more corpse to its credit; for poor B.’s attainments aren’t such as to give her a very secure footing there; & to my thinking a marriage with Nick offers more solid value than a cold blooded & only semi-real attachment with Saxon. I explained my view, with which both Faith & Fredegond agreed. I promised kindness; in case kindness persuades Barbara that there’s more in N. than she sees. Her snobbishness is irritating though natural. In the street my grey knickers came off. So it happened once to Emmy Fisher, & she wrapped a starving dog in them. Fredegond walked with me to Charing Cross. I feel like her in some fundamental way."
1918.01.10,"Our pipes burst yesterday in the sudden thaw. From sharp frost we changed in an hour or two to mildness. L⁠[ottie]. & N⁠[elly]. dealt with this sensibly, but we are without baths. Set up in the afternoon, then to the printers. L. did not lose his temper; little MacDermott asserts that there was a verbal understanding that he need only deliver the press if his was put up. So mild, pertinacious, & muddle headed that we made no impression. The truth is he takes us for amateurs, who needn’t be treated seriously. We are to think things over."
1918.01.11,"Another sedentary day, which must however be entered for the sake of recording that the Lords have passed the Suffrage Bill. I dont feel much more important—perhaps slightly so. Its like a knighthood; might be useful to impress people one despises. But there are other aspects of it naturally. L. to lunch with Ka & a Serbian; I set up, & now find it easily possible to finish a page in an afternoon. L. back, & we took a round by the river, & so home to tea, a great many books. (Life of Keats at last)."
1918.01.12,"Now that printing has set in (we’re at page 18) there isn’t much to write down, though the day seems as well filled as a picture puzzle with succeeding events. We are still without baths, & this lends some severity to other restrictions which we have to suffer. Today, we can only get one small joint of beef, which is to last a week. There is no fat to be had; no margarine, no nutter. We are reduced to 1 lb of butter a week; eggs are 5d each, a chicken anything from 10/ to 15/. Mrs Langston made Sunday dinner last week off sausages & bread & dripping—“Never had such a Sunday dinner for 5 & 20 years.”

After printing we allow ourselves a short walk, & saw a vision of Tinker,—all but the nose accurate; but each dog has an unmistakable impression. The hope of peace all broken up again; policies once more a running in every direction, so far as one can tell."
1918.01.14,"We had Saxon to dinner on Saturday. He was at his lowest ebb. It was impossible to talk to him, but I guessed that he grieves over the inevitable frailty of mankind: his dream of love & friendship triumphing over jealousy has, I expect, been shattered by the latest developments: & he finds himself in a position odious to so scrupulous & sensitive a man as he is. Still, the effects aren’t enlivening for his friends. Even his gestures are weariful. He has been nowhere seen no one. I remember this fragment:

“Have you seen anyone Saxon?”

“I’ve finished the third volume of the Anthology.” He brought me two books of selections from Italian literature. He wrote my name in them with extreme dexterity & neatness. Played chess with Leonard, was beaten which didn’t add to his spirits, & left burdened with the mysteries of this unintelligible world.

On Sunday, Clive came to tea; he hadn’t long settled in when the Shoves arrived; & we spent an hour or two in gossip. When one sees Clive fairly often, his devices for keeping up to the mark in the way of success & brilliance become rather obvious. We were all talking of the 17 Club: upon which he rapped out “I was among the haughty people who wouldn’t join when they were asked, now of course I find its the thing to do, & I’ve had to climb down” the truth being that he wished to join & was blackballed by L. & others. Such would be the truth of many of his stories I daresay, if one knew. But one doesn’t know; the results are quite agreeable, however produced. And as I persuaded him to lend me his typewriter for Asheham, I’ve no reason to be censorious. His habits are like those of some faded beauty; a touch of rouge, a lock of yellow hair, lips crimsoned. We talked chiefly about the hypnotism exerted by Bloomsbury over the younger generation. Some merriment over Clive’s picture of “the complete schoolmaster” at Tidmarsh. F. and G. had gone there, & after tea master & pupil withdrew, but in she [Carrington] came to fetch a volume of Lord Macaulay; & later she asked to be enlightened about some anecdote of Rousseau. “That you’ll know when you’re older, my dear” said Lytton paternally. She took F. aside & confided to her some difficulty about Barbara & Nick. “Nick, she said, is reading hard”, as though there might be hope for him in that. They’re all “reading hard”. Saxon asked Maynard the other day whether he thought Petronius suitable reading for a young lady, who liked Apuleius. But the young ladies dont like Apuleius—when they’re alone. Its matter for a comedy. Indeed I see the plots of many comedies brewing just now among our friends. There’s the comedy of Alix & Bunny; of James & Anonyma; & the tragi-comedy of the two cockatoos. After Clive went, F. & G. stayed to dinner, & were more at their ease. F. told us of A.’s wedding night; undertaken by her from a dutiful wish to gain experience, though the experience included so much autobiography on B.’s part, & I’ve no doubt, eulogies of his father, & peans of the lesser literary lights of the day, that I think she bought it dear. But “on the whole I’m feeling better: partly owing to Bunny”. F. has a great turn for mimicry. She mimicked Karin breaking in late at night & asking “Have you a bite for Carry?” & proceeding to ransack their larder. Karin slapping her thigh & exclaiming “We’ll have a jaunt; we’ll crack a joke”; & also Karin bursting into tears one night from a sense that Maynard &c didn’t want to see her. In fact the dominion that “Bloomsbury” exercises over the sane & the insane alike seems to be sufficient to turn the brains of the most robust. Happily, I’m “Bloomsbury” myself, & thus immune; but I’m not altogether ignorant of what they mean. & its a hypnotism very difficult to shake off, because there’s some foundation for it. Oddly, though, Maynard seems to be the chief fount of the magic spirit. Talk about capital with Gerald: he says he means to part with his, but I guess that he always has some scruple to play with as an intellectual exercise."
1918.01.18,"Another skip, partly due to my writing a long letter to Nessa, which drained up some of the things I should have said here. But I like this better than letter writing. Perhaps one should write novels for the 2 of us only. I can remember various doings however: Toynbees & Kot. to dinner on Tuesday [15 January]; & that afternoon Lady Strachey read to us—to me for the most part, as L. was late. She read Ben Jonson’s masques. They are short, & in between she broke off to talk a little, so that it was lighter than before, & I enjoyed it. She told me how she used to read everything at her school; & can remember the books because places are associated with them. At the age of 18 her father gave her leave to read Tom Jones (I think) on condition she never said she’d read it. Told us that Lytton’s failure to get a fellowship had been one of the disappointments of her life “one of the many”. “Well, this next book won’t be a disappointment”, I said. But she thought the Arnolds would object. Her pride in Lytton & desire to see him a noted literary character very evident. I presumed on this that she was well disposed about Tidmarsh: but as she froze up, & pretended not to know where it was, I suppose there’s a family row—Indeed, its easy to see that when fronted by the present she’s not at her best; conventional, very nervous, thinks they’re ruined; once get her to the past she has no impediments of the sort, & told stories of beautiful dead Patties & Dalrymples with the greatest animation: how old Pattle shot out of his tank, & thereby killed his wife, who thought him come to life again: how the sailors drank him dry on the voyage to England; how “Dal” was charming; though not a good man to marry; how Dr Jackson was so handsome & kind—in fact she seems to divide her life into the part of the exciting romantic illuminated play; & the rest of it is merely trudging along the prosaic streets, with nothing to look forward to. Her eyes collapsed; her teeth gone; deaf; but talk of the past or of literature—& it all lights up again. Literature too must be of the past though. She read us a poem called The Old Way, of a swashing, patriotic kind, & exclaimed how fine it was, & how, as long as we had Hopwood for a poet we needn’t complain. Her patriotism has survived everything else. Patriotism & family feeling, & sights she saw long ago—as for example “You don’t remember I suppose meeting me once on a Bus, when you were 10 or 11? You & Vanessa were with your mother.” She has the family gift of fantasy. She ran out to get two little lozenge boxes which she has covered in scraps of coloured paper, preserved from the catalogues of drapers shops. She mayn’t read much, or write, & plays patience by herself—I suppose she ruminates over her past. According to her it was a splendid time to live in. For one thing, she remembers India before the Mutiny. “Splendid men they were, the Company servants. Your Prinsep relations among the finest. Fancy my horror when I went to see the Delhi pictures the other day, & found they’d called the Prinsep Pier the Princes Pier!” But talk of womens votes doesn’t move her much.

From this ancient world we came back to one younger, as far as years go, than our own. But the Toynbees aren’t spiritually very young: though surprisingly of our way of thinking (which one takes to be young & advanced still!) as to politics. I rashly took this for granted; & Arnold outdid me in anti-nationalism, anti-patriotism, & anti-militarism. At intervals Kot delivered a formal address upon Russia in broken English. There’s a good deal to be said for Kot. He has some likeness to the Russians of literature. He will begin to explain his soul without preface. He explained Katherine [Mansfield]’s soul, not at all to her credit. Her lies & poses have proved too much for him, nor does he find more than a slight gift for writing in her. I dont know that this last pleases me however, though it sounds as if I wrote it down for that reason. He is individual in his view of politics, thinks Russia too little civilised to profit by revolution, but here in England its bound to come with immense benefit because we’ve carpets & gas in our poorest houses. Russia scarcely interests him; he never means to go back; prophesies civil war in the spring, & no advantage won by it. In 1905 they were burning houses & stabbing nobles too. Rosalind has merit to look at certainly. I like her better than Arnold, who improves though, & is evidently harmless, & much in his element when discussing Oxford. He hadn’t much good to say of it; they were both sick of it, & will never go back, nor does he think that young men will ever be found to live there again, save as undergraduates. He knew the aristocratic heroes who are now all killed & celebrated—Grenfells, Lister, Shaw Steuart, Asquith, & loathed them; for one reason they must have thought him a pale blooded little animal. But he described their rows & their insolence & their quick snapping brains, always winning scholarships, & bullying & bringing bath chairs full of rats into Chapel—& admitting no one to their set, so that in the end they were almost abolished by the Colonials, who hated them back. It reads much like a Mrs Ward novel.

Wednesday, 16th, I went to the Library, where I met L. who had been on his deputation to the Colonial Office, which was ill-treated by the Secretary; & then to the Club, where we met Alix of course & Fredegond. These two were making painful efforts to set up house together; but neither could do anything decisive, though it was clear that Alix wished to come to terms, as much as she can wish anything. She had been down to Sidmouth, where her Aunt lies paralysed & doomed soon to die. Her eyelid just quivers, & one side of her lip moves; but in medical opinion she neither thinks nor feels. This had not made Alix either gloomier or less gloomy, though I believe she feels it beneath her gentlemanly good sense. As I left, F. beckoned & begged me to decide for her whether she should tell Alix how Gerald wished F. not to share with her, or prevaricate. I always say that people with short hair must be told the truth. I hear this (Saturday) morning that they have an offer of Amber’s house, which they should take, I think, in spite of Gerald.

On Thursday & Friday & Saturday we worked away at printing, so as to have 8 pages set up to print at McDermotts. Unvarying cold & gloom, which turns now to rain, now to snow. This is the Hell of the year. We seem to mark time in the mud. Wright dined with us on Thursday night—a kindly plausible but long winded man, leaning on L. for support at every point, & giving up his views when they conflicted. They went to see Rowntree together. I have my speculations, but can’t go into them now."
1918.01.21,"We had Nick to ‘look at’ on Saturday night; Barbara came too. He’s nothing very much to look at, certainly; yet so unpretending that what he has to show is satisfactory. Besides he has a pleasant Irish voice, & a quiet very simple manner which make him very tolerable in the house. I rather think that Barbara watched to see what we made of him. He talked his own shop for the most part. Lewis guns, & their mechanism. There are food riots & strikes at Woolwich, & the guards have notice to march there at any moment, & fire on the people, which their own Woolwich regiments would refuse to do. He takes things a little seriously. Next morning we had a long discourse about Irish character. He admires Synge: says that he’s heard his own men talk exactly as Synge makes them talk. They lie on the ground talking, & wont play games. They are deeply religious (the root of all evil in Ireland, he says) & die looking happy if the priest is with them, not otherwise. Their mothers constantly write to know if a son has had a grand funeral, if he has a cross over him; this is their great source of comfort. I suppose the soft, serious, rather plaintive disposition at which one guesses in Nick is Irish; & on top, but not at all offensive, there are signs of his deep admiration for the great Bloomsbury group, & culture, & problems. For instance, he deplores the gulf between what he calls the Quaker view, & the artists view; & he says the Quaker view will prevail with the young after the war. He quotes books seriously. However he went off to Hampstead; & L. went, Heaven knows what made him unless it was chess, to Gipsy Hill to lunch with the Waterlows. Lytton came to tea; stayed to dinner, & about 10 o’clock we both had that feeling of parched lips & used up vivacity which comes from hours of talk. But Lytton was most easy & agreeable. Among other things he gave us an amazing account of the British Sex Society which meets at Hampstead. The sound would suggest a third variety of human being, & it seems that the audience had that appearance. Notwithstanding, they were surprisingly frank; & 50 people of both sexes & various ages discussed without shame such questions as the deformity of Dean Swift’s penis: whether cats use the w.c.; self abuse; incest—Incest between parent & child when they are both unconscious of it, was their main theme, derived from Freud. I think of becoming a member. It’s unfortunate that civilisation always lights up the dwarfs, cripples, & sexless people first. And Hampstead alone provides them. Lytton at different points exclaimed Penis: his contribution to the openness of the debate. We also discussed the future of the world; how we should like professions to exist no longer; Keats, old age, politics, Bloomsbury hypnotism—a great many subjects. L. beat Sydney by his craft. They are leaving Gipsy Hill.

Today, Monday, I went to Harrison’s to have a broken tooth mended; L. to Staines—Philip is back with his wound once more broken out, owing to lack of care at Fowey.

Here I was interrupted on the verge of a description of London at the meeting of sun set & moon rise. I drove on top of a Bus from Oxford St. to Victoria station, & observed how the passengers were watching the spectacle: the same sense of interest & mute attention shown as in the dress circle before some pageant. A Spring night; blue sky with a smoke mist over the houses. The shops were still lit; but not the lamps, so that there were bars of light all down the streets; & in Bond Street I was at a loss to account for a great chandelier of light at the end of the street; but it proved to be several shop windows jutting out into the road, with lights on different tiers. Then at Hyde Park Corner the search light rays out, across the blue; part of a pageant on a stage where all has been wonderfully muted down. The gentleness of the scene was what impressed me; a twilight view of London. Houses very large & looking stately. Now & then someone, as the moon came into view, remarked upon the chance for an air raid. We escaped though, a cloud rising towards night.

"
1918.01.23,"I see I’ve forgotten yesterday; but it was uneventful. L. went up to a meeting, Barbara was left in control of the Press, & I took a walk by myself. I went along the river to Marble Hill. I must retract what I said about the Hell of the year. We have glimpses of Heaven. So mild that the landing window is open, & I sat by the river watching a boat launched, & half expected to see buds on the willows. River very high, swift & yellow, testifying to the floods higher up. They say its been raining heavily; I daresay it has, but such is the civilisation of life in London that I really dont know. What with fires, electric light, underground railways & umbrellas, how can one take notice of the weather. But we look out about bed time & notice the moon. Very clear cut & polished & almost full till 9 or so, & then, much as if God did turn over in his sleep & press a button, down comes a curtain of cloud, & we yawn & sleep sound. Last night, after giving B. her tea, which wastes the chief delight of the day, though poor woman she can’t be better behaved, & if she were gifted no doubt one would hate her actively, we dined early & had the Guild. Mr Adams [unidentified] spoke. The level is certainly not a high one. Even when they know their subject, as he did, they dont know it in such a way as to to make it plain to the uneducated. I doubt whether more than 3 people in the room knew that he was talking of the Co-ops. & politics. He began in the middle. He read bald phrases from Congress resolutions. He could just pronounce such a word as “autonomous”, but I don’t suppose anyone understood it. As usual, L. & I were the only people to speak, save Mrs Langston; as usual it was only when talk drifted near food that one of the women broke silence. She wanted a bread shop. They all got bread late in the day: for a time they all spoke at once—stories of their own ill treatment & of their neighbours. Oddly phlegmatic these women for the most part; with a passive sort of pleasure in sitting there & watching like so many pale grey sea anemones stuck to their rocks. Still, the children, the housework—excuses enough if one troubled to look.

Talking of sea anemones reminds me that we’re in treaty with D. H. Lawrence for his house at Zennor. Its very distant & improbable at present though sufficiently tempting to make me think of that sea & those cliffs several times a day.

Today, Wednesday, B. didn’t come, & we printed. L. did the most of it; & I made two little excursions into Richmond, one to discover the right way of spelling Mynah; the other to buy a new battery, price 1/3. Two of mine have perished during the lifetime of L’s. methusaleh: the wicked old wretch still burns like a spark from a star. I think its wise to have mine in readiness for the raid, though three tradespeople of Richmond know for a certain that there will never be another. The bakers windows now provide almost nothing but little plates of dull biscuits; sections of plain cake; & little buns without any plums. If you see a plum, it is invariably a decoy plum; there are no others. This transformation scene has been stealing on imperceptibly; last year were we still allowed iced cakes? Its unthinkable!"
1918.01.24,"The last day of being 35. One trembles to write the years that come after it: all tinged with the shadow of 40. Another spring day; I do without a fire in the morning. The only drawback is the loss of a fire, & that sense of being in a cave of comfort, with wet & dark outside. Outside its a pale grey. I went to the [London] Library to get a handful of stories on the supernatural; met Sir Henry Newbolt, a slim greyheaded weasel, but we didn’t know each other; then I beat up & down Charing Cross Rd. asking for Keats’ Letters, but they were not to be had anywhere. So to the Club, where I found Lytton by himself, & not feeling inclined for talk we read our papers near together. Fredegond came in; but after laughing a little at her telephone message, I went. She & Alix & Carrington getting together decided that I criticised them, wouldn’t stand it, rang me up, demanded a retraction, which I would only give if they put their complaints in writing: I’m afraid they wont do this. They say I depress them, & the only explanation is that I’m a Saddhist. This is the first turn of the worm. Barbara, however, lets all criticism run off her without a trace. L. printed 4 pages off at the printers today, & only got back at 6 an unsatisfactory job, owing to the incompetence of the printer."
1918.01.25,"My Birthday. L. slid a fine cow’s horn knife into my hand this morning. Nelly has knitted me a pair of red socks which tie round the ankle, & thus just suit my state in the morning. Another event kept me recumbent. Barbara came, & together we “dissed” 4 pages, & L. printed off the second 4 at the printers—altogether a fine days work. At this rate Katherine’s story will be done in 5 weeks. We rather think of doing a little book of woodcuts, either after this book or at the same time, on our small press. Our dinner tonight was a sacrifice to duty on a fine scale; never were we more ready for an evening alone; books to read; a sense of a great deal of talk already discharged this week; but rather before 7.30 came Clara [Woolf] & the Whithams, whom we had asked with a view to killing each other off without more waste than was inevitable. Whitham’s elaborately literary get up is a fair index of his mind. He is what the self-taught working man thinks genius should be; & yet so unassuming & homely that its more amusing than repulsive. His passion for writing is the passion of the amateur—or rather of the person who’s got it up from a text book. Seeing Cannan’s new novel he said “Ah, Cannan, yes—he’s very weak in construction isn’t he?” And so with all the rest. He told me his books had a way of “screaming”, & with great enthusiasm, after asking the fate of my fiction which is a point of honour in professional circles, he ran over all the novels he’s got ready or half ready, or only in want of “phrasing”—which process he applies at the end. He begins with a synopsis, which takes him 3 months: but I didn’t listen to the whole story. They withdraw soon to Devonshire, where directly the war ends (but even the war hasn’t prevented him from adding a new book to the list) he is going to work hard. Writing all the morning, reading & walking the rest of the day. And so we may hope for some 20 Whithams during the next five years or so. When he had told us all this, he went on about spiritualism: their landlord being a fat pale solicitor of 50, who lies on a sofa all day down in Devonshire communing with spirits, & feeding upon bread & margarine. Whitham had dabbled in mysticism, & had made tables walz & heard phantom raps & believed it all, but was too much afraid of the results upon his character to go in for it seriously. I thought this showed weakness, and I expect he hasn’t a good head on his shoulders, as his talk of novel writing makes one perceive. Sylvia sat marking time, & much pleased with the good impression she thought him to make; & in her precise way acknowledged the most revolutionary principles so that they seemed the gossip of a good housekeeper about the price of bacon. Clara’s silence shows I think her subservient position in the family; a person who can never make herself felt—unhappy & comfortless always, I expect. She stayed the night.

Today (Saturday) we went to Kew. Snowdrops, dwarf cyclamen, some miniature rhododendrons out; also the points of some squills or crocuses coming through the grass & dead leaves."
1918.01.27,"As we were going out we ran flap/slap into Desmond bearing round the corner in an impetuous way. This knocked the bottom from our hope of a solitary evening, but as mercifully as possible. We took a turn in the Old Deer Park. He seemed depressed; lines drawn upon his forehead; he sighs oh dear! oh dear! at intervals, thinking about the war or private difficulties, I suppose. Indeed I thought it unpleasant how one has to steer past certain questions with him: when’s your book coming out, has Molly’s novel been taken, are you writing &c—I divine that the answers depress him acutely in the early morning. We gave him tea, & discussed the development of psychology since Shakespeare’s day. L. denied this; I asserted it. Desmond thought Othello & Desdemona very simple; but thought we were tolerably represented in fiction. I find myself altogether unmentioned there. Question whether one should write quick events in short scenes, whether fiction should be like life: whether Thackeray has profundity. Desmond has read some of the Newcomes lately: finds no depth, but a charming rippling conventional picturesqueness. So on to Bob [Trevelyan]’s poetry: “a good commonplace poet”, said Desmond—not the kind to bring up discoveries from his own entrails; looks upon the everyday world & finds the right phrase: classical—& therefore enduring—But I don’t follow this. He brought Enid Bagnold in his pocket, & now, I’m sure thinks he’s reviewed her himself. I’m not going to, after a glance at her mind. She led him to describe a Roumanian Prince, whose voice, he said, was the loveliest in London. He rang him up (to account for not coming punctually for dinner) & I listened, & heard a soft hesitating voice stumbling over long words, rather romantic down the telephone. He went off at last, having wrought himself into a state of contentment & garrulity, so that he would have stayed & given the 4th Act of the Irenaid had he been able, & would have been able, had we pressed."
1918.01.28,"On Monday I went to have my tooth finished, winding up for tea at the Club, which becomes as Goldie said, “quite a family party.” You come in to find half a dozen pairs of legs radiating from chairs towards the fire. You hear, or I heard, “its a case of revolution or evolution” & then, if you’ve heard enough, you seek the Manchester Guardian, evade Sylvia Whitham, & hide yourself for precisely 10 seconds. Fredegond, with apologies breaks through the barrier. “But they’re so fearfully dull, & I must talk something that isn’t politics.” That something, so far as I remember (its Saturday now) was Ottoline, Alix, poetry, love, until Bob, who had been jerking his head towards us could stand it no longer, but towered over us, flapping an elongated proof sheet, & wishing to know if we were talking secrets. “No such luck” I said, so he settled down, with his usual bagman’s assortment of literary gossip. First he said how Clive proposes to buy up The Egoist & start a Bloomsbury review; & then what did we think of Waley, & so on & so on, censorious, scandal loving, but innocent & indefatigable as ever. Home I went, & there was a raid of course. The night made it inevitable. From 8 to 1.15 we roamed about, between coal hole kitchen bedroom & drawing room. I dont know how much is fear, how much boredom; but the result is uncomfortable, most of all, I believe, because one must talk bold & jocular small talk for 4 hours with the servants to ward off hysteria. Next morning,"
1918.01.29,"the after effects of the raid were swept aside by Barbara.

“Virginia, I shan’t come on Friday because I’m going to be married.”

“You’re going to marry—?”

“Yes, Nick.”

“And Saxon?”

“Saxon doesn’t mind. Nothing’s to be changed. We’re all agreed.”

These are the terms. I dont myself think that she wishes to be married; but has convinced herself that she should. Moreover, the horror of Nick’s return in a month keeps her graver than otherwise. She showed no wish to be congratulated or in any way fussed over. She stayed & printed as usual. And, expecting a raid, we asked her to sleep. This time it began at 9.10: the warning at least. It was far louder this time. An aeroplane went over the house about 11.30. Soon after, the guns were so near that I didn’t like to fetch a pair of shoes left in the bedroom. We had arranged mattresses in the kitchen & after the first noise slackened we lay all together, L. on the kitchen table, like a picture of slum life. One thud came very near; but in an hour we had the bugles, & went up to bed. The thud, wh. L. distinguished from the rest, came from the explosion of bombs at Kew. Nine people, I think killed. Servants became plaintive, & Lottie began talking of the effect upon her head; they hint that we ought to leave London."
1918.01.30,"Up to a concert & tea with Ottoline. She is perched in the smallest bedroom of a Bloomsbury hotel, moulting, depressed, untidy, overdressed. Not much talk of interest to me, though friendly & not so overpowering in certain directions as usual."
1918.01.31,"A deep fog all day. We both set type. Dipping out to buy a bun for tea was as much of that air as we wanted. I remembered how glad we were, first of the fog, second of being alone, for Barbara slept at Hampstead."
1918.02.01,"A day of fog in patches. Last night the worst fog they say for 30 years, & old gents, who escaped the raid walked in numbers over the edge of platforms & were crushed. A cook stepped into the Thames; people walked by rapping our railings to keep the road. L. went to London & coming home at 10.30, reported a starry night & clear afternoon, the fog deep once more when night fell here."
1918.02.02,"The first walk we’ve had for ever so long. Damp, mild vaporous day. Funeral bells tolling as we went out, & marriage as we came in. The streets lined with people waiting their meat. Aeroplanes droning invisible. Our usual evening, alone happily, knee deep in papers."
1918.02.03,"Sunday has become as it used to be in Hyde Pk. Gate the social day. The sociability began early for L. at least, Riddell the printer [unidentified] coming, as we hoped to offer a press, but as we discovered only to say that presses aren’t to be had. A female friend was with him. I listened behind the bathroom door. We found Goldie when we came in from our walk; & then Pippa came; curiously untidy, as all Strachey women become at the least provocation. Without a certain degree of good looks it isn’t worth being vain—thats their reasoning, I always suppose. The talk was hampered by the suspicion that she was a jingo: & secondly an older fashioned type then we’re used to. She has the disconcerting though worthy habit of remaining quite silent when she disagrees. She disagreed with me when I said I thought cooperative housekeeping (implying beds) was an improvement on the old style. Goldie shot his direct, well pointed arrows; my only criticism in his case is the feeling which his method produces of being a method. They dig for views too cleverly, these elderly Dons—Still—still—Pippa has faded curiously; looks older, & more worn. She spoke of old days of parties, H. B. Smith, George Duckworth, Jack Hills & Christmases at Corby. She thinks that still the way to live; those people so “civilised” compared with our cropheads. But now she has no time for society; does suffrage, which will turn now into a campaign for equality, by day & night. “Mercifully, she said, there are people like you who keep out of it. Its most important that there should be people like you. That is so long as you’ve got or earned economic independence. Thats essential. No, I’m not clever. I’ve always cared more for people than for ideas—& now I must go. I’ve got work to do. I mustn’t be lured into sloth here.” So she went. It struck me that age consists not in having a different point of view, but in having the same point of view, faded. Goldie shows this too. An evening alone."
1918.02.04,"Up to the Times with a Coleridge article; & once more I lost myself, owing partly to the multiplicity of Water Lanes. Met L. at the Club, where people for once had agreed to silence, & solitary reading of books, so we were left to ourselves. We have started a bottle of saccharine, & so save our sugar."
1918.02.05,"Karin came to give her lecture. She arrived at tea time. I can’t help being reminded by her of one of our lost dogs—Tinker most of all. She fairly races round a room, snuffs the corners of the chairs & tables, wags her tail as hard as she can, & snatches at any scrap of talk as if she were sharp set; & she eats a great deal of food too, like a dog. This extreme energy may be connected with deafness. She has become a Bolshevik. She has offered her services to the Labour party, & hopes they’ll send her up & down England, organising constituencies, since she’s tired of reading & writing—never did much like it, & now scents a scrimmage & wants to be in the thick of it. Socialism is nibbling at our friends in a curious way. She & Adrian have scruples about the size of their income, & wish to earn money, partly because half their income depends on Mrs B. She gave her paper on League of Nations well, though speaking too quick. The difference that education makes is very marked though. I think they took her points. I was surprised to hear that she was much relieved when it was done. She stayed the night, & the next morning, which with a fitness of simile now to be explained, costs me a tooth to lose. Moreover, she sits over the fire, & I have to shout. But I see that Adrian must find her energy, her not fastidious or critical but generous & warm blooded mind, her honesty & stability a great standby—"
1918.03.02,"What is the use of finishing a sentence left unfinished a month ago? Here we are; evening; I came back from Asheham, or rather Charleston, an hour ago. After Karin went that Wednesday, rather a monotonous time began for me. Influenza began on the Friday; I was kept in bed 8 days; on the next Tuesday [19 February] we went to Asheham. My chief complaint is that I was divorced from my pen; a whole current of life cut off—Secondly I saw no one; for 5 days I wasn’t in a state for reading; but I did finally read Morley & other books; but reading when done to kill time has a kind of drudgy look in it. I was asked to write a book in a series—Makers of the 19th Century; but after deliberation refused, nor did it at any moment seem possible. But I write this down partly to give an official look to this diary, & partly because it marks a middle aged condition. Undoubtedly the country develops the spiritual side of life. One day I sat in the garden reading Shakespeare; I remember the ecstasy: every other day at least we had to walk to Southease for milk; we were only allowed one quart a day—7d a quart. The garden shows great promise. L. dug up the large bed, & transferred plants from the round middle bed to our path bed. The buds visible on the trees; sheep in the hurdles on the side of the down. For 9 of our 10 days we saw no one; my letters even failed fairly completely; but the days melted into each other like snowballs roasting in the sun. On Thursday [28 February] Nessa came for the night, & I went back with her to Charleston for Friday night, L. taking the servants up to town. Henry Moss had just arrived. We all met for dinner, for to my relief N. & I had tea alone in the drawing room. Moss & Mrs Brereton give off a fairly strong atmosphere of the paid & paying guest kind which is not pleasant. Mrs B. an elderly upright firm unflinching woman, whose integrity has been her chief capital in life. She reminded me strongly of Nurse Reid: she has the professional competence & composure. Moss one might meet—practically anywhere. He is a pale insignificant young man, either very shy or very much out of his element. We carried on as best we could, entirely unhelped by him, & though Mrs B. spoke from a sense of duty, she allowed nothing to blossom in her presence, but dealt with each remark literally & sensibly. Ann, the daughter, is much more charming than one might expect—though no doubt marriage trials & poverty have flattened out Mrs B’s charm prematurely. She calls H. Moss her “adopted son”, which sanctions their withdrawal after dinner to his bed sitting room, where they are supposed to make up stories for the Saturday Westminster. On Saturday morning Nessa, Duncan & I sat in the studio & gossiped. Part of the time we discussed art. This is what I like doing best with them. They say that there’s no one worth considering as a painter in England today—no one like K.M. or Forster even with whom its worth discussing one’s business. In France this is reversed. Nessa showed me Saxon’s letters. He has made her his confidante. He has been very unhappy; & made out his moments of exaltation & depression with his usual minuteness. In one he said that it was curious no longer to care for anything, death being as desirable as life. And then details about his health. We discussed also the peril of society, which has to some extent washed off poor old Desmond’s bloom, & would submerge Maynard, if he were an artist. I left at 1.15, walking in a high wind with 2 parcels slung across my shoulders, to Glynde; through the park. Back here for tea, & met L. buying the Hanwell Gazette. I found a letter from Saxon—a little cold, I can’t help thinking, at least showing one, after his letters to Nessa, that in this crisis I’m not his confidante. Its queer how one chooses one figure each time one’s in a state for reasons not perceptible to the figure herself. Last winter I was to hear everything."
1918.03.03,"A vile windy day. Sent off my Conrad article, at last—& printed a few labels for Bunny, but we stayed in, & were very happy."
1918.03.04,"L. took 4 pages to the printer today to print off. I being useless for this purpose went off to get into touch with London again, which I did at the three usual points—Mudie’s, London Library & Seventeen Club. London, from a spectacular point of view was at its worst; like a middle aged charwoman with hair scrubbed off a bleak forehead. In St James’ Square a village of houses has been built to shelter some ministry, I suppose; & it was strange to see how holes have been cut in the walls & the roofs to allow the trees to stand undamaged. Some of the clerks will have a tree trunk to wipe their pens upon. I found a silent group at the Club, all men, & unknown to me, with the exception of Alix who sat still as a statue reading one of Berty Russell’s books. I interrupted though this is against my principles, & we had tea together. Her chief piece of news was that she & Saxon are going to set up together in Faith’s house after Easter, for the duration of the war & 6 months beyond it. I fancy that they see something a little comic in this combination of the hopelessly enamoured, & indeed one can’t help smiling rather at the thought of silences in which each will be thinking of someone else; & one fancies their common bond leading to a great deal of sympathetic collaboration, but the plan is evidently a good one. It recommended itself first to Mrs Bridgeman, the housekeeper, who thought two such quiet people should live together. I did my best, this time, to keep low in tone, serious, & as far as possible sympathetic. Alix’s feeling had been, she said, that I ‘floated’, & didn’t mind how my prosperity reminded both her & Fredegond of all the things they lacked. But why should F. lack anything? I left her sitting there, as I believe she always sits, till they turn out the lights, or James comes to take her to dinner. What will she be at 45?

Home to find the two darkies [Perera and Jayatilaka] here. L. spent 3 hours or so printing, but did it in the end."
1918.03.05,"Another bitter day. L. up to a meeting at the 17 Club. I spent the afternoon “dissing”, ran out into the High Street, and was inveigled into the penny Bazaar, where the simplicity of shopping tempts one to spend. The Guild meets tonight for Nick to address it."
1918.03.06,"Again one has to wonder why the women come—what inducement there is in such a passive employment as sitting silent, half asleep, in a chair for an hour. Nick was in the right style for them too; simple, detailed, casual, much at his ease. He spoke for an hour. The thing that remains in my mind of the lecture is the waiting for trains, & the marching out “with moon & stars looking very cynical” he said, along perfectly straight roads lined with poplars. His matter of fact way of speaking, as if necessity must be borne—however outrageous to his sense of decency & common sense also struck me. He seemed in good spirits; proud of Barbara; telling us of her conquests, which he believes in implicitly; talking more than usual, & telling me how after the war they’d like to live in the country & make good furniture after designs by Carrington. He’s a human being of very good nature without special gifts to bend him this way or that; the same is true of her, I think. Its a rare production in our particular circle. L. to a meeting; we now have a mania for gambling over Demon patience. I lost 4/ over this in a week. Impudent letter came from Williams, about L.’s book. He is showing, or means to show, the doubtful passage to co-operators, & therefore can’t start printing yet. L. now threatens to ‘put the matter in the hands of his lawyers’!"
1918.03.07,"In these 2 days I’ve ‘dissed’ 4 pages, in the hope that we may finish 8 pages of the story before we go away again. The raids seem so distant now that this precaution seems excessive. The servants still sleep in the kitchen however, as a shadow of moon remains. Philip came after lunch, & he & L. walked to Kew. I met them on the towing path. He is obviously very wretched; has no future wishes evidently, save to get out to France. He brought some of Cecil’s poems, which we have offered to print at once, in a small book, in our old type—As giving him occupation it would be a good thing to do. & he offers to come & help. The more one sees of the effects on young men who should be happy the more one detests the whole thing. Philip takes more interest in the military side of it than Nick, I think. He has refused an offer to work in London. A bitter day, & our coal finished tomorrow. The last raid dropped a bomb on the coal merchants."
1918.03.08,"From yesterday’s writing it looks as if the raids were casting their shadow before me, & were sent expressly by God to rebuke my arrogance. However this may be, we played our patience; I lost my 3 and so to bed, the only thought in our minds being, I think, something to do with patience or printing. I’d taken my third & final roll in bed, when there was an explosion. For half a minute a raid seemed so improbable that we made out it was one of the inexplicable outbursts of motor omnibuses. However, next minute the guns went off all round us & we heard the whistles. There was no denying it. So we got our things together & went to the kitchen. This was at 11.30. Looking out we could only see stars yellowish in some sort of mist; no moon; but a still night. As we lay down on our mattresses there was a great though distant explosion; & after that the guns set in very thick & fast to north & south, never, but once, so near us as Barnes. At 12.45 we had cocoa & went to bed. The bugles sounded at 1.35—two hours from start to finish.

I shall never forget the ecstasy with which L. burst into my room at breakfast. The wretch Williams has caved in. He agrees to cancel the contract. L. was as triumphant as a fighting beast who has driven his enemy to skulk into the bushes. I think he has reason to be. For one thing it looked as though he could still worry & impede for some months to come; & L. might have been forced to arbitrate. As it is, the way is open, & instead of dealing with a surly unwilling spiteful mangy exasperating cur, he can make his own terms—which he’s doing this afternoon with Allen & Unwin. Going up in the lift at Holborn the other day I stood next a boy of 14 or so, whose head only was visible among the crowd. I noticed that it was an extremely interesting, sensitive, clever, observant head; rather sharp, but independent looking. One couldn’t tell from his cap whether he was well off or not. I came to the conclusion that he was the son of an officer with whom he stood. When we got into the street I looked at once at his legs. His trousers had holes in them. From that one could judge what a wretched affair his life will be. I began setting up Cecil’s poems this afternoon. They’re not good; they show the Woolf tendency to denunciation, without the vigour of my particular Woolf. I had all sorts of accidents & only finished one."
1918.03.09,"L. found Unwin very ready to consider the Co-operation book, &, what is more, unqualified in his abuse of Williams, who could, he says, be sued for the damage he’s done to the book’s prospects. He proposes to issue 2 editions—one paper, one cloth, at once; after, that is, reading the book which he means to do directly. I daresay Williams will still try to keep his paw upon the manuscript.

We went to a meeting called a ‘Suffrage Rally’ in Kingsway this afternoon. It was a very fine afternoon & through a glass door one could see the day light—a difficult light for speakers to speak down. So prosaic, reasonable, & unconcentrated. The hall was fairly well filled; the audience almost wholly women, as the speakers were too. The pure essence of either sex is a little disheartening. Moreover, whether its a meeting of men or of women, one can’t help wondering why they do it. I get one satisfactory thrill from the sense of multitude; then become disillusioned, finally bored & unable to listen to a word. In truth this meeting seemed to beat the waves in vain. The vote being won, only great eloquence could celebrate the triumph. None were eloquent; & yet they had to beat up a froth. The one who impressed us most was the Russian speaker, who had imagination, & seemed to feel what she said. But at best large indisputable platitudes, finely dressed & balanced, are the only things that can be put into speeches. I watched Mrs Pethick Lawrence rising & falling on her toes, as if half her legs were made of rubber, throwing out her arms, opening her hands, & thought very badly of this form of art.

We had tea at the 17 Club. One room was crowded, & silent; at the end of the other Aldous Huxley & a young woman in grey velvet held what should have been a private conversation. A. has a deliberate & rather dandified way of speaking. All we learned & virtuous people bent over our reforming papers in dead silence; an occasional sentence of the muffled dialogue came out plain from the other end of the room now & then. They were discussing Evan Morgan & his affairs of the heart I think.

We went on to the London Library; & as we walked down the steep street someone came ambling & crouching up to us—Bob. T.—laden with an infinitely shabby baggy portmanteau—full of books, I think. So we went on together; & first he confided in L. & then in me—At least he has the air of making a confidence, or asking for one. He wanted to know whether he could add my name to the list of devout Jacobeans. Percy Lubbock & Logan Smith play this very characteristic game, of exquisite interest of course to Bob. They’ve counted 20, & Bob was seriously exerting himself to find a 21st. But I refused—with some vehemence at first, thinking I was to be asked to subscribe to a memorial. Nothing so substantial; only an elderly cultivated game."
1918.03.11,"I spent 7/ on books this afternoon; a fact to be recorded, since its the only mention of buying books this year, or last, perhaps. As a matter of fact I’ve accumulated 12/ as Times money; add 5/ for a birthday present, & I have 17/—an unparalleled gain. First, however, I beat the town for chocolate or sweets. In the whole of the stores, not one ounce of choc, to be had; but some simple square drops, such as one used to buy in a bag for a penny. Half a crown will now buy a pound of them. Half a crown in old days would have bought a coal-scuttle full. Then I went on the top of a bus, for the day was of the quality of June, only fresher, & sadder too, to Nutt’s shop to get a Leopardi; then to Mudies where I bought Mill on Liberty; then to the Charing Cross Road where I bought the Happy Hypocrite, by Max Beerbohm; & Exiles of the Snow, by Lancelot Hogben. In this way I laid out 7/. But I was amused to find that the lust after books revives with the least encouragement. I want a copy of Congreve. I could have had one containing all the plays I shall ever read for 2/6 I daresay; but this demon suggested that I might enquire for the Baskerville in two volumes. The bookseller shared my lust which increased it; in short I told him to make enquiries. He would not commit himself to name any probable price, from which I judge that he is calculating on the lust to possess it when I see it. And, after all, nothing gives back more for one’s money than a beautiful book—obviously I’m slipping. I sauntered round his shelves, as I had done in most of the shops. He is careful, select, bookish; no bargains but the type of book one might like to buy. These bookshops have an air of the 18th century. People drop in & gossip about literature with the shopkeeper who, in this case, knew as much about books as they did. I overheard a long conversation with a parson, who had discovered a shop in Paddington full of Elzevirs. He denounced the government, particularly for its waste of paper. They should abolish all newspapers, & stick a sheet in the p. office, if there happened to be any news.

So to the Club, where I found L. Fredegond, Gerald [Shove], Goldie, Brailsford, & Alix. The poet Hogben was also there. I laid his little book on the arm of my chair. Gossip of the usual kind. Poor Hogben’s book is precisely the dreary imitative stuff one might have expected; or even worse than one might have expected—what Lytton would call “illiterate”; under the influence of Swinburne, incredibly ungifted, & weakly rebellious.

Home. L. to a L. of N. meeting."
1918.03.12,"This page should be wholly devoted to praise of the weather. One curious effect of spring in the suburbs is that it produces an astonishing amount of male & female singing in the evening. We sit with open windows, & a lady warbles out notes in apparent ecstasy. She may be forgiven though, considering—Here are some facts. I sat by choice on a seat in the shade at Kew; I saw two Heath butterflies; willows, crocuses, squills all in bud & blossom. Black clothes look like dusty palls. As for fur, it makes one laugh. We met at Kew.

I may say that I’m “rejected by the Times”. To rub this sore point sorer, L. has 2 books from the Nation. Its the second week of my rejection; & it has the result of making me write my novel at an astonishing rate. If I continue dismissed, I shall finish within a month or two. It becomes very absorbing. We both notice that lately we’ve written at a terrific pace: L. 40,000 words & as yet hasn’t touched the book itself; I’m well past 100,000—"
1918.03.14,"If I’d written this diary last night which I was too excited to do, I should have left a row of question marks at the end. What excited me was the evening paper. After printing all the afternoon I went out later, bought a Star, looked at it casually under the public House lamp, & read that the Prime Minister needed our prayers. We were faced with momentous decisions. We Britons must cling together. In a week or even a few days facts must be faced which would change the British Empire for ever. We evolved from this an offer of peace to France: but it appears to be only L.G.’s way of whipping up his gallery. Anyhow, I was whipped. Gerald who was to have dined, rang up to say that a raid was expected, & he must “stand by”. The night was cloudy, & we weren’t much alarmed, partly because the warning came from official sources.

My dismissal is revoked. A large book on Pepys arrived, which I spent the evening reading, & now another on Swinburne awaits me at the Railway station. I’m divided whether one likes to have books, or to write fiction without interruption. But I may make a few shillings to pay for my Baskerville."
1918.03.15,"Happily the weather is turned cloudy; spring blotted out, but one must sacrifice spring to the war. Philip came & we printed—I making rather a mess of the poems, to my annoyance. Philip talked about Blimey who is a shepherd near the Quantocks."
1918.03.18,"I wrote the date, & then something interrupted me—a letter I think, to Lytton giving reasons for not reviewing his book. Today is Wednesday, & this the first moment I’ve had for writing after tea. On Saturday the chatter began. Lytton & Carrington came to tea—she apple red & firm in the cheeks, bright green & yellow in the body, & immensely firm & large all over. The talk has run off my mind, so that I don’t suppose there was anything said of great importance. They’d been at Barbara’s party till 5 the next morning. Fredegond & Nessa kept it off the rocks by giving an imitation of Ottoline. Nick & Saxon both gloomy in the background. Carrington going out of the room for a second, Lytton explained that he would like to stay with us without her, could it be managed. He asked me to review his book. I agreed without thinking. On second thoughts I dont much want to write under surveillance, or to ask B⁠[ruce]. R⁠[ichmond]. for what he must know to be the book of a friend. On Sunday the burden of visitors was oppressive. The list speaks for itself. Gerald [Duckworth] & Saxon lunch: Saxon tea; Barbara, Nick, Middleton Mur⁠[r]⁠y dinner. Gerald’s likeness to a pampered overfed pug dog has much increased. His hair is white. There is hardly a gleam of life, let alone intelligence in his eye. The feebleness of his hold on life save through the stomach must be fearful. He has no opinions, but merely a seaweeds drift in the prevailing current. His commercial view of every possible subject depressed me, especially when I thought of my novel destined to be pawed & snored over by him. But the odd thing was that he had nothing to say. This took till 3, perhaps; Saxon at his least urbane & most insignificant. Its melancholy that misfortune should be unbecoming, but I’m afraid in his case it is. His complexion suffers; his mind seems frost bitten. He was beaten at chess, & went, as if not wishing to meet N. & B. Nick was the only cheerful one of us. Poor Murry snarled & scowled with the misery of his lot. He works all day, & writes when he comes home. Worst of all, K.M. has been very ill with haemorrhage from the lungs, out in France, & has to be brought home, wh. is difficult, in order to see how bad she is. But I thought him very much more of a person & a brain than I had thought him before. I think this was partly due to the contrast with Nick. The difference between a good mind & a mediocre one is very sharp—Not that M. is as easy, or as agreeable. But he works his brains, always has worked them, & thus cuts his way through a different atmosphere. I had a good deal of talk about books with him, such as one couldn’t have with Nick—though he’s read Jane Austen, & can keep his end up by natural good sense & taste. B. was almost blotted out; scarcely spoke, I think. They went first; we said goodbye, the modern method of covering all obviously emotional crises with a varnish of prose & common sense makes such partings almost ostentatiously matter of fact. Murry stayed on, for a time, discussing French writers & Thomas Hardy. He will never write another novel, he says. Poetry is a short cut & “life seems to me now very precarious.”

On Monday [18 March] I stayed here & did my compositors work. L. to London.

On Tuesday we had tea at the Club, meeting all the usual people, save that Bryn’s a rarity, went to a general meeting, where L. was elected 5th on the committee; & then on to dine with Ka. Arnold Forster the other guest. Much to my surprise the first person to come in afterwards was Hilton Young. I dont think I’ve said 6 words to him since 1908—when we had that interview. I’ve always guessed that dark dealings on the part of O.H. intervened; at anyrate we broke completely. This knowledge made me at least uncomfortable. But we are elderly now. He a perfect type of naval officer, cleanshaven, shorn, red faced, all blue cloth & gold braid with a ribbon on his breast. His dark enigmatic ways (the Sphinx without a Secret) are swept away; & yet I liked him—thought him kind & trusty & a little romantic—I’m afraid no longer romantic about me. But how even begin to guess another’s feelings? I found myself pitying him for the very first time. I suppose he’s more than 40, & after all, he wished for something which he’s done without. We talked hard indeed. He find⁠[s] no romance in the navy after four years. We wondered about our vision of England. Not knowing his degree of pugnacity, talk was difficult save on general subjects. The Shoves came, & a brisk friend of Ka’s out of an office I think, as we left. Little W.A.F. very humble, very small, very innocent, as he used to be."
1918.03.20,"We printed—but just missed getting it done."
1918.04.05,"I think that Wednesday was broken off short, as they always tend to be on the verge of a move, & so far as I remember it snowed hailed thundered people. Off we went to Asheham on Thursday, in such a burst of summer heat that people in the Tube pulled blinds down, & the uproar & potency (what word will express the stir of life still cased in a soft velvet sheath?) of Richmond worshipping a Tank was like the hum of bees round some first blossom. We had the bee & the blossom in no metaphorical sense at Asheham. Once more my memory is most centred upon an afternoon reading in the garden. I happened to read Wordsworth; the poem which ends “what man has made of man”. The daffodils were out & the guns I suppose could be heard from the downs. Even to me, who have no immediate stake, & repudiate the importance of what is being done, there was an odd pallor in those particular days of sunshine. There’s always a sadness in spring of course—Our visitors broke in upon the moods which weave so thick a texture into life alone at Asheham. First Lytton. Then we waited, with eyes upon the avenue, for the appearance of Barbara. She never came though, & upon Sunday I had a letter telling the almost incredible story of her repeated attempts to get into a train; how for three days she went to Victoria; & sometimes was kept outside the barrier; sometimes was stuck opposite the gap between the carriages; never got in, & finally spent Easter alone in her studio, expecting, so we are told, to find herself in some 9 months short of a fortnight, the mother of a child. Lytton was with us one day less than a week. Our chief exercise was along the road to Beddingham. We had short, & to me, very intimate talks; intimate in the sense that he will understand from the sight of the tail what the whole body of the thought is in one’s mind. These thoughts were for the most part about books; but books include a good deal of life. I suspect that he is now inclined to question whether Eminent Victorians, 4 in number, & requiring 4 years for their production, are quite enough to show for his age, & pretensions. At anyrate he was evidently & rather painfully anxious about our opinion of their merits, & came back so often though so tactfully to the question of my review that I hesitate. I suppose the contrast (& to me there is a contrast) between his achievements & L.’s achievements made itself felt to him. Then he was sick one morning “green sickness”, Lottie described it with her usual passion & enthusiasm for painting all colours at their brightest. His ebb of health is very low; & certainly health does make one careful, perhaps a little peevish, spiritually. I remarked, whether the result of bad health or not, a distinct increase in his family pride; it has now reached almost a religious pitch; a bad sign. Like patriotism it means that certain feelings are to grow large & lusty under shelter. For instance, James must be exalted as a man of “iron will”, superb administrator &c: but the light is shed on each one of the family; & even upon cousins, like Mary H. I rather resent it. Then James & Noel came. Our patience wore rather thin. Visitors do tend to chafe one, though impeccable as friends. I’m always glad at the end of a visit to find one’s liking unmodified, as it was in all three cases,—yet I’m puzzled to account for the sense of strain & discomfort which the people one likes most manage to produce. L. & I discussed this. He says that with people in the house his hours of positive pleasure are reduced to one; he has I forget how many hours of negative pleasure; & a respectable margin of the acutely unpleasant. Are we growing old? Are our habits setting in like the Trade Winds? But this time the food difficulties certainly increased one’s discomfort. One day we came back from a long walk to find the third of a loaf of bread on the table. No more to be had in the house. This was due to bad management on Nelly’s part, but then at Asheham it’s very easy to manage badly & needs considerable thought, cycling & carrying to manage even tolerably. At one point the servants wrought themselves into the usual row. The relief of being back in comparative plenty & anyhow next door to shops is quite recognisable. We came up on Friday, went straight to lunch at Clifford’s Inn, dived into Partridge & Cooper, & then I came home and L. went to see Bonwick.

The result of seeing Bonwick is what I foretold (see page [109]). They have offered him the editorship of the new Review, & indeed make his acceptance a condition of starting it, which they propose to do at once. Some arrangements must be come to with Wright, but they will solve themselves I suspect. L. has 10 days in which to decide. There’s the question of staff, of salary & so on. If he accepts, he will be able to give up feeding the omnivorous & callous throated Eagle with reviews. Considering the merits of that cheap & thin blooded creature, (I speak of his journalism) & his methods of running the paper, his lack of power judgment & competence, I shall consider L. wise to take the other job merely as a means of escape. But in itself too it might be not a means but an end. Thus we had rather a sanguine happy sort of return, considering how disappointing returns generally are."
1918.04.06,"This morning I had a letter from Barbara telling me that Nick was dangerously wounded on the 30th. The wound is in the back & kidneys, & they have operated.The last news said he was well through the operation. They have heard no more. If he recovers, perhaps he won’t be sent out again—but who knows? At least she has had the blow soon, & if it were me, I should think that a blessing in itself. But the state of waiting for telegrams & letters, without any certainty when they’ll come, & this baby in prospect, must be as fair a combination of torture as human beings can invent for each other. However, Saxon is moving house; she helps him; his voice on the telephone sounded as if pleasure of some sort had not entirely deserted him. But when a crisis happens, scarcely anyone meets it naturally; either they’re too composed & prosaic, or the other extreme. Saxon has a curious cul de sac of his own.

Rain all day till this moment, when it has turned brilliant. Plum in blossom in the garden, & flowers very healthy looking. To turn over books in Hiskoke’s. I bought Collins’ poems & Colley Cibber’s Autobiography—1/ both together. L. to Staines. Flora’s husband has just gone abroad."
1918.04.07,"We are just back from tea with Barbara & Saxon in the Studio. Nick is already moved to another hospital & has written himself, so at least he must be in no immediate danger. Indeed they think he may be home any day now. We had tea; Saxon in his brown woollen vest, stepping fantastically about the room to lay the table; Barbara so evidently nervous that I suppose the child must be a fact—but that 4 days—waiting for news can try anyone’s nerves. The couple in the interior were almost too perfect an illustration of the post impressionist spirit for my taste. Even the black & white cat seemed decorated by the Omega. White wash in which the hairs of the brush remain, a striped pole, Burnet for the covers, china dogs for the mantelpiece, check cottons wherever you looked, & to the censorious eye one or two uncertainties of taste or reversions to an earlier stage, as for example a bead necklace hanging on a nail. However I came back to think my own room very ugly. The talk was sober, adequate, but not profuse. I don’t think Saxon (who had just washed his head) had anything to say; & his demeanour is a little tart & gritty at the moment. He reminded me of a hen who has laid an egg—but only one. We did not like Hampstead. The vulgarity of Richmond is always a relief afterwards.
"
1918.04.08,"There is an awkward moment between coming back from London & dinner which is the salvation of this book. For some reason one can’t settle to read, & yet writing seems the proper channel for the unsettled irritable condition one is generally in. Perhaps this condition is intensified by tea at the 17 Club, particularly if one happens to meet Roger in the Charing Cross Road, in his wideawake hat with four or five yellow French books under his arm. He is the centre of a whirlwind to me. Under this influence I was blown straight into a book shop, persuaded to lay out 3/7 on a French novel, Et Cie, by a Jew, made to fix a day for coming to Durbins, invited to a play & fairly overwhelmed—made to bristle all over with ideas, questions, possibilities which couldn’t develope in the Charing Cross Rd. Of course he was in a hurry to keep an appointment at the Burlington, & to produce one or two plays somewhere else—ill too, so he said, but somewhat relieved in his mind by reading Fabre, who makes him see that after all our war, hideous though it is—but here we parted. I ran in to a kind of backwater of Roger at the 17 Club: Goldie, & Miss Dudley at least. Mrs Manus & Langdon Davies & L. can’t be included under that heading. We sat in the groundfloor room; & poor old Goldie wrinkled his forehead & flung himself lightly & ardently into one question after another in his usual way—the way of a bachelor who lives by plying his mind & moving by that means from person to person, having no settled abode. A sort of gipsy or vagrant. He mourned all the deaths of the young men—Eric Whitehead the last to be killed. Said that he would fight if young enough; as it is he sits on committees. I left them to conduct another committee, & went to Poland St. to get my watch. On the way I walked through a narrow street lined on both sides with barrows, where stockings & ironmongery & candles & fish were being sold. A barrel organ played in the middle. I bought 6 bundles of coloured tapers. The stir & colour & cheapness pleased me to the depths of my heart. But I couldn’t pay 5/6 for my watch, owing to the seductive magic of Roger in the Charing X Road, & so had to leave it, ticking away like a young watch. Home by Victoria. A sunny evening, swarming with people."
1918.04.09,"This is most curious weather; also most unpleasant. Rain descends at intervals from a dark grey sky; even when it isn’t raining the sky is still grey. Its warm, damp, & the young leaves have a lurid look in the winter atmosphere; the green is as if seen at night by electric lights. We quarrelled yesterday, about my jug of cream; & L. was unreasonable, & I was generous. The quarrel ended at 4.25 sharp. At 4.30 Miss Mattaei arrived. I remember her at Newnham. She has left, we understand, “under a cloud”. It is easy to see from her limp, apologetic attitude that the cloud has sapped her powers of resistance. We skirted round the war, but she edged away from it, & it seemed altogether odious that anyone should be afraid to declare her opinions—as if a dog used to excessive beating, dreaded even the raising of a hand. She & L. discussed their business, which has to do with W⁠[ar]. & P⁠[eace]. & may result in an offer to her of a place on the staff. She has to earn her living. “I must tell you one thing, she said, when the talk was over, my father was a German. I find it makes a good deal of difference—it is a distinct hindrance commercially.” L. agreed that it was. She is a lanky gawky unattractive woman, about 35, with a complexion that blotches red & shiny suddenly; dressed in her best, which was inconceivably stiff & ugly. But she has a quick mind, & is an enthusiast; said she loved writing.
"
1918.04.10,"A very wet dark day. Printed. I set up one page in 1 hour & 15 minutes—my record. At this rate, the book might be done in a month. I had a letter from Miss Harriet Weaver yesterday asking whether we would consider printing Joyce’s new novel, which no other printer will do, owing presumably to its sentiments. They must be very warm, considering the success he had with his last. She is to come here, though we can hardly tackle a book. I like this dipping into the great bran pie. By the way, I’m rejected by The Times once more; & thus reel off my book at a great pace, & I suppose books will flood in all in a heap one of these days. To the printer, who has almost set up his new machine, but without power & without a compositor we are still far from getting our rights."
1918.04.11,"To the 17 Club this afternoon. But one must describe the weather. Imagine living inside a yellow balloon, the ceiling of which floats up & down, with an atmosphere inside of exhausted air. Such is our situation. When the ceiling sinks nearly to the top of our heads we have to turn on the electric light; as we did at luncheon. Occasionally rain falls, but brings no relief. Going to London all the lights in the train were on. I went to the Omega, got my pictures & ran into Roger, carrying a roll of manuscript, which was, he said, his translation of the Lysistrata. This he has done, on a moderate knowledge of Greek, & wishes to have acted, but doubts how far one can go. I carried the pictures all the way to Gerrard Street, stopping at Poland Street to pay 5/6 & get my old gold watch, whose distinction & dignity are very marked after 6 months of Ingersoll. At the Club I found—need I repeat that old scene once more? I think the change from toast to roll & honey interested me more than the fragments of Scurr Cousins & Marshall, or than the pale constrained solemnity of poor Alix. Having robbed her of a fortnight with James I felt rather guilty. L. came in from the Natives meeting. He is going up again to a farewell party to Bertie at Mrs Hamilton’s. Last night he went, for less than 30 minutes, to a Labour Party meeting."
1918.04.13,"L.’s farewell party was freely sprinkled with our non conforming friends. I don’t know why their virtues in combination are so depressing. There was Dora & Adrian & Karin (she announces that she is with child) & Burns & Alix & so on. Bertie broken down, & safe to be imprisoned either for his article or for his conscience. The new bill rakes in all the elder generations. All their consciences are now being racked; but so far they seem inclined to stop short of prison.

Friday was a pleasant day; the sun out, & the blossom & leaves of a natural colour. We spent the afternoon printing. It was the first evening we had alone for a long time. Sunk deep in our chairs we were interrupted in our books by Walter Lamb. Upon review of the conversation we agreed that he was slightly above his usual level. He told long stories of his walk in a snowstorm, with every detail given a prominence more interesting to him than to us; the wildest romance would be flattened, however, by that voice. Lord Canterbury is again to the fore. He is a Persian scholar & has given W. the Arabian Nights. He lives in a house which is not fashionable enough to do him justice. He has an Italian footman who secures meat from a friend in any quantity. A small loin of lamb was left at W.’s door the other morning. He expects to fall again before the temptation. He has given up reading, finding no time for it; but examines boys in the Classics. Told us stories about J. J. Thompson, whose mother keeps a small shop where Watty used to buy sweets as a boy. So we slipped on; W. sitting between us, L. yawning without concealment, I yawning with an attempt at concealment. The Academy is storing its precious pictures, only 18 in number, in some Tube. They are told to expect immense bombs at the end of the month, which will dig 20 feet deep, & then explode.

Today Saturday we printed, & finished 6 pages. As we only began on Tuesday we have done a record. A cold dismal day, & very bad news in the newspapers. Stout red-faced elderly men are visibly perturbed. And Ireland has Conscription. If one didn’t feel that politics are an elaborate game got up to keep a pack of men trained for that sport in condition, one might be dismal; one sometimes is dismal; sometimes I try to worry out what some of the phrases we’re ruled by mean. I doubt whether most people even do that. Liberty, for instance.

Last night Desmond rang us up. I’m afraid our friends’ motives won’t stand scrutiny. His book comes out on Monday; he, though forgetting everything, yet remembers a vague joking promise of mine, uttered at least a year ago, to review it in the Times. He is sending me a copy. He wants to stay here. I’m now debating how to deal with these damned authors—"
1918.04.18,"There is a grave defect in the scheme of this book which decrees that it must be written after tea. When people come to tea I cant say to them, “Now wait a minute while I write an account of you”. They go, & its too late to begin. And thus, at the very time that I’m brewing thoughts & descriptions meant for this page I have the heartbreaking sensation that the page isn’t there; they’re spilt upon the floor. Indeed its difficult to mop them up again. And at this moment the mere length of my list of unrecorded visitors frights me from beginning. Judge Wadhams, Hamilton Holt, Harriet Weaver, Ka, Roger, Nessa, Maynard, Shepherd, Goldie, not to mention the Guild & Alix & Bryn & Noel, (who may be called the 17 Club:) all these have accumulated since Sunday; & each deserves something to mark their place, & I did mark it at the time. But how recover the impression of Wadhams & Holt? It was a tremendously successful visit [on Sunday 14 April]. We had prepared ourselves most accurately. They made speeches & looked at the pictures & complimented L. all according to forecast. They were impressive to me in the first place for their vivacity which combined with their large well nourished bodies made them appear powerful; next because they treated me with respect; & then because they were simply & intensely in love with the League of Nations. Judge Wadhams had “spotted” every minister in America. They were in touch with every group of people in the world, as far as I could gather, with an army of stenographers who send out pamphlets with the personal touch wherever a pamphlet can lodge. Compared with this our record is tame. “We put you right on the top, Mr Woolf, of the constructive thinkers of the war—I can see your place on my shelves at this moment—… Pardon me, you have used the word “social” more than once. I dont rightly understand what you mean by it….” We both explained for 10 minutes. “No; I don’t understand.” “Well we must proceed to the Sidney Webbs; but we’ve done no more than scratch your surface Mr Woolf, & we must try to do more next time—With thanks to you, Mrs Woolf, for letting us see your home—” & off they went.

But almost instantly Harriet Weaver appeared. Here our predictions were entirely at fault. I did my best to make her reveal herself, in spite of her appearance, all that the Editress of the Egoist ought to be, hut she remained inalterably modest judicious & decorous. Her neat mauve suit fitted both soul & body; her grey gloves laid straight by her plate symbolised domestic rectitude; her table manners were those of a well bred hen. We could get no talk to go. Possibly the poor woman was impeded by her sense that what she had in the brownpaper parcel was quite out of keeping with her own contents. But then how did she ever come in contact with Joyce & the rest? Why does their filth seek exit from her mouth? Heaven knows. She is incompetent from the business point of view & was uncertain what arrangements to make. We both looked at the MS. which seems to be an attempt to push the bounds of expression further on, but still all in the same direction. And so she went. And Ka came & was made to drink castor oil out of an egg cup, & lay on a sofa, & was nearly sick, & had a disturbed night & was better next morning.

Then I went to Guildford. I don’t see how to put 3 or 4 hours of Roger’s conversation into the rest of this page; (& I must stop & read Viola Meynell) it was about all manner of things; on growing old; on loneliness; on religion; on morality; on Nessa; on Duncan; on French literature; on education; on Jews; on marriage; & on the Lysistrata. Occasionally he read a quotation from a book by Proust; (whose name I’ve forgotten), & then from his translation [of the Lysistrata]; & we woke next morning to find the hills covered in snow, & came up in a bitter wind & rain to the Omega; so to Gordon Sqre; where first the new Delacroix & then the Cézanne were produced. There are 6 apples in the Cézanne picture. What can 6 apples not be? I began to wonder. Theres their relationship to each other, & their colour, & their solidity. To Roger & Nessa, moreover, it was a far more intricate question than this. It was a question of pure paint or mixed; if pure which colour: emerald or veridian; & then the laying on of the paint; & the time he’d spent, & how he’d altered it, & why, & when he’d painted it—We carried it into the next room, & Lord! how it showed up the pictures there, as if you put a real stone among sham ones; the canvas of the others seemed scraped with a thin layer of rather cheap paint. The apples positively got redder & rounder & greener. I suspect some very mysterious quality of potation [?] in that picture. All day it rained, & L. was out to tea, & brought Goldie home to dinner. Goldie was “humiliated” by the fall of Bailleul, but told his neat well groomed stories, & I went to the Guild, which pleased me, by its good sense, & the evidence that it does somehow stand for something real to these women. In spite of their solemn passivity they have a deeply hidden & inarticulate desire for something beyond the daily life; I believe they relish all the pomp of officers & elections because in some way it symbolises this other thing. They recanted their abuse of the woman on syphilis, which I think to their credit. Since then they have learnt, they said that she only spoke the truth. They wish me to get them a speaker on Sex Education, Mrs Hiscoke telling us that she had had to get a friend to explain the period to her own daughter, & she still feels shy if the daughter is in the room when sexual subjects are discussed. She’s 23 years old.

On Wednesday [17 April], L. went to lunch with Rowntree, & accomplished another stage of his progress to the Editor’s chair. A dummy copy is to be prepared. R. still hedges, on the question of expense, but remarked all the same “Thou art the man!” L.’s hand shook so that he had no luncheon. This came entirely of discussing the question before he went up. I went to Caslon’s, & sat in that solid impressive room among the empty desks & smooth tables while they went to fetch me 1/6 worth of h’s (lower case) & the Printer of the bank of England ordered 2,000 lbs of type to be conveyed at once in a van, the weight being beyond the capacity of a taxi. I find immense satisfaction in hearing the talk of these solid, competent business men, who give their orders with such weight & simplicity & never a word wasted, & such character of a plain sort, in every movement & feature. To tea at the 17 Club; & Alix & Bryn & Noel there, & I rather disliked them all. On Thursday we took a little walk, but in the teeth of such wind that there was little pleasure in it. Then L. had to dine with Margaret. He is becoming almost a diner out. But in our circle this is a matter more of business than of pleasure. One goes either to meet someone, or to settle something, or to say goodbye to a prisoner. Bertie’s case still hangs fire however. Today I got Desmond’s book, sent, I’m sorry to say, by request of the author. Richmond, when I asked for D.’s & Lytton’s books said “Certainly—if you can keep it secret”. I couldn’t promise to do this, & therefore wrote to tell him not to send them. And now I must inform Desmond & Lytton. They won’t suffer really I believe, but they will be anxious instead of safe, & I’m in two minds as to whether I’m glad or sorry. I think I could have said some very clever things, & a few true things, but undoubtedly one cant avoid a certain uneasiness in writing formally of people one knows so well."
1918.04.19,"A day of gigantic effort for L. Eight pages printed it off. He went at 1.30 & is still (6 p.m.) at the printers, standing in the cellar & slipping page after page between the pins, having had only a short time off for tea. By tonight I shall have 8 pages to diss. & then to set up; though the type runs to 9 pages, 3 lines with the new h’s: t being the one to give out at last. Snow, storms of wind, bitter cold, & occasional sunshine.
"
1918.04.21,"How many poor people, clergymen & retired officers for the most part, must be tapping the glass & looking gloomily at their lawns covered with withered blossom—withered still half closed, & then blown off the twig. Orchards must be ruined by this time. At Kew yesterday the magnolias were a most melancholy sight; the great pinkish buds just ready to burst into the most magnificent of flowers, & now browned & shrivelled never to open, & while they live to be ugly. We noticed several branches ending in white gloves, according to L. a sign that some experiment in grafting is being tried. Even the daffodils are all blown crooked. Fruit trees brown & nipped. The weather goes on with its wind & rain & occasional snow. I went to a concert at the Palladium this afternoon; but on the whole I regretted it. A man called Julian Clifford played Mozart as if it were a Dream Waltz, slowly & sentimentally & with a kind of lugubrious stickiness which spoilt my pleasure in the G. Minor. L. to Staines. I must now write to Desmond, who has been telephoning, I fear, with thoughts of that review."
1918.04.26,"There are five or six days missed out—I don’t remember why, but partly at least because there wasn’t much to say. On Monday [22 April] I remember having tea at the Club & meeting Fredegond, Ermengard, a lady farmer & someone I took to be Bryn, but she answered to the name of Daphne. The Shoves are driven to the land again; had left it to the very last moment of course, & being under compact to have a job by Monday were still in doubt whether to try Cambridge, Hertford, or Hampshire. I talked mainly to Ermengard—a rare visitor, but somehow familiar. As L. remarked these country women get a slow bovine manner, rather refreshing to my taste. She breeds prize bulls, plays a double bass in the evening, & writes improper stories for children. She seems to have settled into a corner absolutely fitted for her, where she exists pleasantly, having a Quaker faith now to round her off. I got the impression of some large garden flower comfortably shoving its roots about & well planted in the soil—say a Stock, or a holly-hock.

On Tuesday [23 April] Wright dined & slept here. I listened with respect to a long conversation, in which both L. & he played their parts with perfect knowledge of the rules of the game. Such was the impression that their deliberate, easy & yet concise manner of speech made upon me. How far W. minded his fate it was difficult to say. The rules of the game require complete urbanity. He was extremely nice to play so well of course. He offered to help as much as he could. His opinion of his own powers as Editor being naturally higher than ours or indeed than the Trustees, this was very nice of him, but I expect there’s truth in his own saying that he’d rather get what he wants done by others than do it himself. He labours under a variety of diseases, & is very deliberate, taking twice the time to finish a meal that we do, & perhaps 4 times as long to finish a sentence. The question of salaries was discussed. W. thinks this will be referred to him. He suggests from £200 to £250 for Miss Matthaei; between £300 & £400 for L. This is more than we expected. However it depends on more people than Wright (Eagle here rings up to say he’s standing for Parliament—a labour candidate—At that rate the Manx cat has a chance).

On Wednesday [24 April] Lottie spilt half a case of type on the floor, so that I had to spend 4 hours in sorting every compartment—about the most trying work there is. She had mixed the letters in thoroughly, thinking or hoping that though divided in compartments the letters were all the same.

On Thursday I was recumbent & L. went to do proofs at the office.

On Friday we set up, & took a short walk. The weather varies between fog & sunshine, saving us at least from raids, though the moon is full."
1918.05.01,"There’s a fate in saying that we’re safe from raids; On Friday [26 April] I went to the Hippodrome, to see life; L. seeing a different variety of it at the 17 Club. The incredible, pathetic stupidity of the music hall, (for surely we could have risen higher, & only politeness made us laugh,) almost made me uncomfortable; but the humour of Harry Tate, though a low grade was still the queer English humour; something natural to the race, which makes us all laugh; why I don’t know; & you can’t help feeling its the real thing, as, in Athens one might have felt that poetry was. Home about 11. At 12 the usual maroons, & even extra whistling. The fine night made this likely; we bundled our bedding into the kitchen & took up our appointed stations; L. and I lying by the grate; N. & Lottie whispering in the cellar. After 20 minutes, I thought I heard bugles. One’s ears can imagine so much that I said nothing. Ten minutes later Nelly burst out “The bugles!” So they were. We went upstairs, inclined to blame some clerk whose ears played him tricks which the night made into certainties. But Desmond tells us that 3 American aeroplanes crossing the coast without giving the signal caused the false alarm, which woke the whole of London, though ignored by the press.

On Saturday [27 April] we went to Hampton Court, the first visit for a long time. But this weather (I am unjust though; Saturday was fine). We had a tremendous talk about the Equator. In the middle of a demonstration with two pebbles, Jack Radcliffe passed (or so I thought). This diverted my attention. A serious reprimand had to be administered. It was discovered that I took the Equator to be a circular mark, coloured dull red, upon the end of a football. The ignorance & inattention combined displayed in this remark seemed so crass that for about 20 minutes we couldn’t speak. However, I was forgiven, & told about the tropics of Cancer & Capricorn. The question originally was about the time of moon & sun rise & setting in different months.

On Sunday [28 April], Desmond came to dinner; that is after dinner. He has the hard sea worthy look of an old salt, cased in stiff black, with a few gold scrolls about him, & hoots made out of plain leather. But within this shell he is as tender & vague as ever, & very tired after his days work which results, he is alarmed to find & so are we, in practical action upon his evidence. His mind had a factitious spryness about it, as if still working under the official eye; but this wore off, & he yawned, & couldn’t stir himself up, though L.’s yawns were partly the cause of his. Late at night he took to reading Joyce’s ms. aloud, & in particular to imitating his modern imitation of a cat’s miau, but L. went to bed, & though capable of spending a night in this manner, I had compunction, & decoyed Desmond upstairs, collecting books as we went. Next morning, having observed that breakfast at 8.30 would possibly be early enough, he stayed talking about books till 10, & rambled off quite out of tune for his office. L. dined with the Webbs. At this point it would be useful could I command the pen of some intelligent & well informed diarist, with an eye for the future; someone who could put down what were the really interesting things that Sir Wm Tyrrell, Camile Huysman, & the Sidney Webbs said.

[In LW’s hand] Went to dine at Webbs. Camille Huysmans & Sir William Tyrrell there. The latter is now Head of Commercial Intelligence Dept & is engaged on drawing up complete dossier of our terms for the Peace Conference. A small, round, grey, friendly man, more like a well-mannered literary man—if there be such—than a diplomatist. Very frank—ostensibly—& talked incessantly of policies & people. “A friend of mine was at Kiel on the day of the murder of the Arch Duke & saw the Kaiser immediately after he had heard the news. The K. said: “Es ist ein Verbrechen gegen das Germantum”. When I heard that, I knew it meant war.” “Lichnowsky has a poor mind. He is a sort of village idiot. His Polish blood however gives him a kind of intuition so that he sees further sometimes than cleverer men—the intuition of the village idiot.” The only hope, he said, was for the Allies definitely to declare themselves for a League of Nations & define its constitution. We should be surprised, if the German offensive fails, at the stiffness of the German terms even then. “Wilson under certain circumstances will be the most immoveable of Never-endians.” “The most impertinent thing ever written was Kuhlmann’s answer to the Pope. A friend of mine met K. & K. told him when he came to England to ask me what I thought of it. I said: ‘Tell K. I think exactly what he thinks of it!” He said he had always thought that the greatest mistake the Allies ever made was to refuse to allow our men to go to the Stockholm Conference.

On Tuesday [30 April] I went to London. In fact, I went to the printers in Farringdon Street, & got wind of a second hand press; but how far this is the usual talk of shopkeepers I don’t know.

On Wednesday May 1st we were to have printed off; our 8 pages were ready, & a 9th too (w. gave out this time). But the printer has his magazine on the press & wont be free till Saturday. These impediments are inevitable but jarring—We were getting along so well.

On Thursday, we tried printing the title page on the small press. Nothing would make it come right. The disease escaped us. We had to give up in despair—irritation at least. All these days as black as November; & a high cold East wind."
1918.05.03,"L. to London to see Henderson. In course of seeing Henderson he saw all the celebrities of the day. Webbs, Goldie & so on. I went to a Registry Office in the King⁠[s] Rd. to get a servant for Nessa. The woman true Chelsea; marked as China is, by her dress, manner, & refinement. She has a servant, which is more to the point. On then, by Bus & tube to Hampstead, & to tea with Margaret. I almost mistook Lilian semirecumbent upon a green pillow for a Persian cat. Janet was there in those decorous purple draperies with which people compromise between art & fashion in Hampstead. Margaret immensely fat & broad; all black; she had stood two photographs of Ottoline opposite my plate. I felt this to be the heart of the woman’s republic. L. came in, & we had a long semi-political argument arising out of Milk combines, about government. Margaret’s carpet is there to give an air of austerity to the room.

“Ah yes, my lifes a compromise—all a compromise” she said. I was struck as usual, by her genuine character, & also by the unadorned sense of Lilian, always to the point, & surprisingly ready with her views, considering her air of modesty. As a matter of fact I believe she comes at things better than most women, being entirely unencumbered by any vanity; as she may well be; in clothing, manner, appearance, she is of the most ordinary type possible; & thus her talk, & her pipe, come with force. Janet shows signs of real old age; acquiescent; not blunted, so much as increasingly meditative—shakes her head a little. But she looked very well."
1918.05.04,"Hodson came to lunch. A soldier now, though by profession a civil servant. A hard, straightforward man, all about him seeming as close cropped as his head. A man of average gifts, I suppose, & thus a sample of what the world does to human beings. He has no special gift or fortune to palliate life. In this light I thought him rather sad; so grim, unpretending, & taking what comes as if it were anyhow good enough for him. He didn’t like the war, but joined “as a duty”. First the bachelors went, then the married men, then those who could afford to. His passage cost him £200. But there was no trace of heroism in this: mere “such is life”. He went to Kew with Leonard. I to the printer who remains shut. The first fine day since April 1st, or thereabouts. Hot, blue sky, no wind. Birds singing; & people swarming."
1918.05.05,"But when the wind turns to East, it pours. Such a spring I can’t remember, though for blackness the summer I spent in bed at Twickenham matched it. According to Nessa the country has the same climate. This being so, we walked out in our mackintoshes, up the river & down the Avenue. Scarcely a couple to be seen. I pitied the orange barrows, half covered over, with some wet man sheltering near under a tree, his Sunday sales demolished. The tea gardens, too, look dishevelled, with their daffodils bent & drenched. Outside Dysart House we heard a cuckoo, inside some forlorn week end party was listening to a pianola. Desmond put us off, I confess to our relief; his mother burnt her face lighting a gas stove. L. was rather headachy, perhaps owing to a swollen tooth."
1918.05.06,"L. was so uncomfortable this morning that we went out at eleven, for it was sunny & beautiful, the wind being in the East. We meant to sit in Kew Gardens, but they don’t open till 12: & therefore we sat on Kew Green, which has been turned into allotment gardens: ugly patches of raw earth, spotted with white paper stuck into sticks. At twelve we entered. To the general loveliness & freshness was added a sense of being out when we should have been at home; this always turns things into a kind of spectacle. It seems to be going on without you. We sat under a tree, & became a centre for sparrows & robins, & pestered by the attentions of a gigantic aeroplane.

L. went to Harrison’s, & had his tooth out, for it was very bad & pouring poison into him, sufficient to cause many headaches, so Harrison said. I went to London on my usual round; the one I like best. In my beatific state I forgot the principle thing I’d gone for; a typewriter ribbon; but never mind; that will be another days treat. Mudie’s I dont altogether like because I’m kept waiting, but I love Holborn, & the Charing Cross Road, & I rather like turning into the 17 Club, & finding or expecting to find someone I want to talk to. I dont like buying hats though: though I’ve conquered some part of the horror by learning how to look into the eyes of milliners, & make my demands boldly. Eighteen shillings for a hat seems a great price; but I paid it; & it relieves me so much to have bought it that I’m happy again in the end. But what women’s faces in the streets! As senseless as playing cards; with tongues like adders. I found James reading the Antigone in the Club. Presently Leonard came, with Adrian. Adrian looks immensely long, & his little bow tie somehow gives him a frivolous rather than distinguished air, as if a butterfly had settled on him by mistake. He has some job in an office. We gossiped. Blood is a very strong tie; so much can be taken for granted, after the first shyness. Then Barbara came in, in her round black hat with the cherry coloured ribbon, as neat as if she’d never been in France; but all the same I think she is a little different. Nick is in hospital, & very irritable. She spends her spare time with Saxon. I daresay the seesaw is not working quite smoothly; but one cant honestly deduce this from a shadow round her eyes! We went on to the London Library, & so home."
1918.05.07,"I write expecting Philip Morrell to dinner—not that one need dwell upon that—Wind East & violent rain & grey sky again. A letter from Harry Stephen, suggesting a visit, as if he’d been in the habit of dropping in after dinner once a week all these years. The ties of blood? Something very odd moves in the Stephen brain. L. better, though not entirely right. The tooth was an ancient mammoth. I must read Logan’s Trivia now. L. has gone to a [League of Nations] meeting at the House of Commons. I’ve had a rush of books as usual: three Tchekovs, Logan, Squire, & Merrick hanging over me."
1918.05.28,"The rush of books was disposed of, & Squire was well drubbed too; at the same time such a rush of people coincided, that I was clogged into complete dumbness, I see; but to take up the pen directly upon coming back from Asheham shows I hope that this book is now a natural growth of mine—a rather dishevelled, rambling plant, running a yard of green stalk for every flower. The metaphor comes from Asheham.

But first let me recall Janet, Desmond, Katherine Mansfield & Lilian; there were others,—yes, there was Harry Stephen & Clive. Each left with me a page full of comments, but useless now partly I think from my habit of telling these incidents over to people, & once told, I don’t want to retell them, the telling leaves a groove in my mind which gives a hardness to the memory, stereotypes it, makes it a little dull. But I wandered through Richmond Park in the moonlight with Desmond. We jumped a palisade into Miss Hickman’s funeral grove, & found the dark green mounds pointed with red rosettes. The rhododendron is a lovely flower for the moonlight. And we beheld a china watercloset also lovely in the moonlight, the divinity of a sheltered lodger, wedged in among the ferns & the flowering bushes. Desmond, who has been pestering me with inscrutable persistence, over the telephone in letters in visits to lunch with Prince Bibesco, dropped all that, drank a whole bottle, & bubbled like a tipsy nightingale, amorous, humorous, reminiscent, &, remembering the dead, perhaps melancholy in a happy sort of way. But he spoke rather pointedly of the charm & intelligence of Molly.

“Yes, I’ve never feared tragedy in your lives” I said, nor does one, though from what we hear, they strain at the collar now & then. But modern life has the merit of allowing for that. Katherine was marmoreal, as usual, just married to Murry, & liking to pretend it a matter of convenience. She looks ghastly ill. As usual we came to an oddly complete understanding. My theory is that I get down to what is true rock in her, through the numerous vapours & pores which sicken or bewilder most of our friends. It’s her love of writing I think. But she is off to Cornwall. Harry Stephen told his old stories, wrinkled his nose, & alluded several times to his great age. He is 58. An undoubted failure; but that has a freshening effect upon people; they are more irresponsible than the successes; but yet one can’t call Harry exactly irresponsible either. He is modest; humorous; all his pride for his father & ancestors. He still takes out an enormous pocket knife, & slowly half opens the blade, & shuts it. Janet was decidely more spirited than of late. She discussed Greek with L. She is still puzzling out theories about Plato: very open minded, & ready to understand whatever one may spring on her. I sprang first, Joyce’s novel, then the Murrys; who are to be neighbours. Lilian read a paper to the Guild in a thoroughly co-operative spirit; I think I should take exception to their maternal care of the women’s souls, if I were connected with the movement. But I see the terrible temptation of thinking oneself in the right, & wishing to guide & influence.

Then Clive was in his best man-of-the-world vein, fresh from Max Beerbohm, & inclined to think himself one of our foremost. He sent me his book, where I find myself with Hardy & Conrad; & Nessa & Duncan bracketed first. He babbled & prattled & hinted at all his friends & parties & interests—not offensively, to me at least. He gives, or wishes to give the impression that he sits drinking in the Café Royal with Mary, & the young poets & painters drift up, & he knows them all, & between them they settle the business. His book is stout morality & not very good criticism. He seems to have little natural insight into literature. Roger declares that he doesn’t know about pictures. On the other hand, he has the strong English sense of morality. At Asheham we had Roger, a picnic, & I spent a night at Charleston. That is by way of company. But the important thing was the weather. The heat was such that it was intolerable to walk before tea; we sat in the garden, I indolently reading, L. not sitting but gardening. We had the best display of flowers yet seen—wall flowers in profusion, columbines, phlox, & as we went huge scarlet poppies with purple stains in them. The peonies even about to burst. There was a nest of blackbirds against the wall. Last night at Charleston I lay with my window open listening to a nightingale, which beginning in the distance came very near the garden. Fishes splashed in the pond. May in England is all they say—so teeming, amorous, & creative. I talked a good deal with Nessa—much about servants & other possibilities. Roger, of course, came up from Bo-Peep, & there was Mrs B⁠[rereton], burnt brown, solid, stolid, institutional, & very competent. Roger & I croaked a kind of frogs chorus together—how we loved & admired & were only snubbed for our pains—Nessa sitting almost silent, stitching a dress by lamplight. Roger is growing more egoistical, or it is more apparent to me; & his complaints were more genuine than mine. All interesting people are egoists, perhaps; but it is not in itself desirable. There were numbers of Belgian Hares, & equal numbers of children to judge by the sound, though they are kept to their own rooms & hours by Mrs B. & don’t appear at all. Saxon & Barbara arrive at Asheham as we go—this being our compromise, for we didn’t want them as visitors as they, coolly enough, proposed that we should have them."
1918.06.06,"These gaps are accounted for by the weather. Its not weather for drawing up to the fire & settling in. Indeed, I find some difficulty in reading. The windows are both open; the children next door are playing in the garden; the usual song comes from the singing teacher’s room above the laundry; the birds are vocal in the trees. I want to be wandering down grassy spaces. Its impossible to concentrate. Things therefore pass unrecorded. A good deal of sociability goes on in this weather—Adrian & Karin dined with us on Sunday; she resolutely artistic in a distressing way; bright green, with sturdy embroidery let in. They live rather apart from our world; from all worlds, I cant help feeling, though this may be wrong. A. never troubles himself to see anyone & together they make too dense a block to be good guests at a party. A. was amusing, however. Prejudice leads me to think my own relations rather distinguished. He certainly makes one laugh with his stories of Saxon “Fifteen minutes it takes him to get from the recumbent to the sitting position.” A. is observant, malicious, but more kindly than of old. He has the taste, & she the energy. I’ve seen Alix too—indeed asked her back here to dine with me, L. being out. I think the faintest ray of dawn is observable on the pitchy black of her horizon. She is able to conceive the possibility of one day finding some book to read. She has tried Bertie’s mathematics, relinquished it, but did not altogether dismiss my suggestion of legal history. She wants to work at something that matters to no one; & will never be used, seen, or read, & can be done for no more nor less than 3 hours a day.

Then Carrington came to tea with me, L. making a speech again, (his activities are beyond counting now—what with League of Nations & all its evil designs. War & Peace, & its possibilities, to which one must add the persistent darkies, & the 17 Club committee). Carrington stayed over 2 hours; & I think that by itself is a sign of youth. She is odd from her mixture of impulse & self consciousness. I wonder sometimes what she’s at: so eager to please, conciliatory, restless, & active. I suppose the tug of Lytton’s influence deranges her spiritual balance a good deal. She has still an immense strange admiration for him & us. How far it is discriminating I don’t know. She looks at a picture as an artist looks at it; she has taken over the Strachey valuation of people & art; but she is such a bustling eager creature, so red & solid, & at the same time inquisitive, that one can’t help liking her. She posted me up in all the gossip. Jos has married his deaf governess, & thereby blasted the hopes of Heaven knows how many Marjories. She is dismissed in the harshest way, humiliated in the face of all her friends—or so I should feel it. Lytton complains that the critics haven’t attacked his judgments. They have copied each other & complimented him without much fineness. Still his book goes into another edition; the praise from the elderly, the Ottolines & the Goldies, is lavish. I haven’t yet read it through; indeed, I’ve rather shirked formulating my own opinion, expecting to find it rather complicated. At any rate, as I’m on the verge of cooking dinner & going up to hear the Magic Flute I shan’t begin now. And Oliver has taken a new mistress, & Barbara & Saxon have left Asheham, & I can think of no more gossip for the time being."
1918.06.07,"One thing Adrian said amused me—how it positively frightened him to see peoples’ faces on the Heath “like gorillas, like orang-outangs—perfectly inhuman—frightful” & he poked his mouth out like an ape. He attributes this to the war—though I can remember other pronouncements of the same kind before that. Perhaps the horrible sense of community which the war produces, as if we all sat in a third class railway carriage together, draws one’s attention to the animal human being more closely. L. was told the other day that the raids are carried out by women. Women’s bodies were found in the wrecked aeroplanes. They are smaller & lighter, & thus leave more room for bombs. Perhaps its sentimental, but the thought seems to me to add a particular touch of horror.

I went to the Magic Flute, & thought rather better of humanity for having that in them. Goldie was in the same row with me, thinking I daresay much the same thoughts, though the proximity of two youthful men may have coloured them differently. There were Roger & Pippa, & Sheppard & finally Mary Hutch. & Jack & Alix & James—all collecting in the hall for a moment in the twilight, for the sun, at 10 of a hot day, was hardly out of the sky. Mary & Jack in their dress clothes, took me back some 20 years; more accurately they took me back to the New English Art Club, she with her plastered hair, & he with his ruddy face & black riband across his shirt front. Home, & in the carriage I saw Jean [Thomas], & remained hidden behind an officer. I dodged her successfully on getting out, & then, hurrying up the main road, distinctly heard myself called, “O there’s Virginia.” I hesitated, but judging such rudeness impossible, turned back, saw Jean! was received with the utmost surprise, for she had been talking about a cab, though thinking, so she said, of me—She introduced me to Ann, who used to figure so when I was in bed; the lady with the romance in India, which Jean prayed she might have strength to overcome. I could only see a featureless shape, & strode on again, Jean begging to come & see us, very cordially.

I admit it may be vanity; but people do certainly show themselves very cordial & anxious to come all the way out here—I think we make a good mixture—at any rate, here are the Sangers, Kot & Gertler, Pippa all waiting to be fitted in, while Ottoline never ceases to gape wide for a week end. And we’ve promised one to the Waterlows."
1918.06.08,"Another gap of ten days takes me to the conclusion of our Waterlow visit. With the sort of clumsiness one might expect of them, they’ve pitched upon a house in the village of Oare; taken it for 28 years; in spite of the way it misses all the good qualities one might have had, with such a range to choose from. You have a view of a dull farmyard; only a glimpse of down, & the house stands in the village street, too much in a hollow to be capable of a view. Sydney has mellowed & grown less susceptible to the good & bad opinions of his friends. She is a gnome like figure; but acute as the unattractive women tend to be, depending upon hard work for their wages. She produced excellent food, & manages the two unattractive children without a nurse. “All is black round me” she said, during a discussion on Saturday night, “I get no acute sensations; I wonder if its worth while.” S. talks of taking to literature again. The defect of the household lies in their relationship. She has no admiration for him; he no romance about her. Clear eyed people could scarcely feel otherwise; but how I hate the average! Strictly speaking, they’re both above the average. The average is a very queer study though: humble, aspiring, & without illusions.

None of these qualities are common with the people we see for the most part. I must run over the names of those we’ve seen in 10 days, so far as I can remember them. Ray for the night; Molly for dinner & also for the night; the Sangers & Murry;—the others are now forgotten. Ray lectured the W.C.G. How strange it is to see one’s friends taking their fixed shape! How one can foretell middle age for them, & almost see them with the eyes of the younger generation! “Rather a terror”, I think they’ll say of Ray. She has the look of conscious morality which is born of perpetual testifying to the right. She has grown heavier, more dogmatic; her attitudes are those of the public speaker & woman used to knocking about the country. She speaks in all the counties of England. She has lost such feminine charm as she had; she seems mature. But she is made of solid stuff; & this comes through & pleases me, & L. likes her better than the cropheads. We discussed the moral eminence of Moore, comparable to that of Christ or Socrates, so R. & L. held. They challenged me to match him in that respect by any of my friends. I claimed for Nessa Duncan Lytton & Desmond something different but of equal value. R. tends to think us a set of gifted but good for nothing wastrels. Her days work gives her some claim to look down upon us; but it would be unfair to say that she condescends or judges. She merely makes one aware of a different ideal. What ideal does Molly live for? A very wandering will o’ the wisp—but she chases it, & sticks in the bog, poor woman, & hasn’t the clearest of notions as to what she’s after. She has Desmond’s Character on her mind. She imagines that he is much talked about, & greatly derided. Its worth noting for my own benefit how very little talk goes on compared with the victims notion of what must go on. She had ready an elaborate defence of D. but finding it unneeded, she confessed to the truth—that she finds him a little spoilt, terribly without a will, & much at the mercy of any fine lady or gentleman with good wine. I couldn’t deny all this. I believe she worries herself acutely. Let alone the worry of money; she has a sense of failure, of decadence, & infulfilment. She means to give up London & live in the country, as an attempt at cure. But there’s something sordid about it now—no longer pure fun. She finds his mind vitiated; his views no longer so interesting.

Murry & the Sangers came here to supper last Sunday. Dora becomes increasingly ungainly. She has become so lame that in order to take off her boots, she has to kick out one leg, & then hunch herself round into an attitude where she can crook hold of it again. Indeed, I had to do it for her. Murry was pale as death, with gleaming eyes, & a crouching way at table that seemed to proclaim extreme hunger or despair. Charlie has his wintry brightness still; but weighed down by all this cadaverous company, he scarcely chirped his best. And after dinner such a duet of despair was croaked by Murry & Dora as warmed the cockles of Dora’s heart.

“At Christmas, said Murry, I was near suicide; but I worried out a formula which serves to keep me going. Its the conception of indifferentism. I have hope no longer. I live in 2 layers of conscience. (but I forget what these were.) Dora egged him on, & sounded his praises when we went through the struggle with the boots again.

But to us he seemed less nice, perhaps more anxious for effect, this time than before. Despairing young men who have worked out philosophies & describe them remind me too much of Henry Lamb. But there’s more than that in Murry. I expect he is used to being an oracle in the underworld.

Then Leonard went to the annual dinner, which was almost a dinner in honour of Lytton; but not very interesting to L. at least; & I went to Don Giovanni, to my infinite delight; & last Friday [14 June] we went to the League of Nations meeting. The jingoes were defeated by the cranks. It was a splendid sight to see. The chief jingo was H. G. Wells, a slab of a man formidable for his mass, but otherwise the pattern of a professional cricketer. He has the cockney accent in words like “day”. He was opposed by Oliver [Strachey], Mrs Swanwick & Adrian. There were also present such gnomes as always creep out on such occasions—old women in coats & skirts with voluminous red ties, & little buttons & badges attached to them—crippled, stammering men, & old patriarchs with beards, & labour men, & ourselves. Lord Shaw presided, & Sir W. Dickinson. It was comical to see their polite horror at the sight of our party, but Hobson won, by virtue, I expect, of his academic appearance. Wells, when he found himself thwarted lost the sort of effervescent good temper he has, & struck out as wildly as he could, & spat sarcasms at Williams & Hobson; & finally left the room; but we found him caballing in the hall with McCurdie & Spender, & L. is now in London hearing the result at a meeting of the executive.

"
1918.06.24,"The League of Nations intrigue hasn’t stayed in our favour, owing to various chicaneries practised by Sir Willoughby after the General Meeting. But I’m not competent to give a clear account of them. The amusing thing to me is to see Adrian transformed into an orator, an agitator, a man with convictions. I can’t take it quite seriously; I mean I attribute it partly to his need of defending his own attitude as a C.O. He is a little sheepish; & yet works out points, circulates letters, whips up converts, & organises meetings of the godly at the 17 Club, where they plan the most extreme measures. Its odd how people invariably fall into these separate groups, & can’t be united, each asserting a complete grasp of the right. But all this week has been harassed beyond any enjoyment by the great servant question. As I haven’t traced the stages, I won’t begin now. The question was whether N. & L. should go to Nessa for 3 months. At first they agreed with gladness; then they hesitated; then they asked for assurance that we would have them back; then they formally accepted; then they violently refused; then Trissie arrived, on a sudden, as ambassador; spent the night, argued, won her case & lost it again. Finally she and I found a widow & child in Soho who take the place; & now all is as it was, after more conversations, emotions, letters, telegrams, parleyings, compromises & diplomacies than would have set Europe in flame. Trissie’s character, so far as I can make out, is the one thing irretrievably damaged in our eyes; the rest have slightly risen in value. At one stage in this agony, Gertler & Kot dined with us. Gertler is a plump white young man, got up for the occasion very sprucely in sponge bag trousers. His face is a little tight & pinched; but the word he would wish one to use of him is evidently “powerful”. There is something condensed in all Jews. His mind certainly has a powerful spring to it. He is also evidently an immense egoist. He means by sheer will power to conquer art. But bating this sort of aggressiveness, he was well worth talking to. L. noticed his amazing quickness. He would soon have told us the story of his life. I felt about him, as about some women, that unnatural repressions have forced him into unnatural assertions. He examined our furniture & pictures. He likes shiny lodging house things best, he said. He has never felt akin to anyone. He thinks himself very much cleverer than most painters. Kot sat indulgently silent, professing scarcely to notice what was before his eyes. They both described their Jewish families. On Gertler, as upon Murry & Katherine, rests to my feeling the shadow of the underworld. You could put no trust in him; on principle, I can imagine, he is unscrupulous. Kot is different—rather in the style of the solid lodging house furniture, but with an air of romance.

We had a visit from Margaret; which opened with a tremendous broadside of cooperative shop; lamentations, aspirations & too sanguine expectations; all exaggerated, so I felt, in comparison with their real value. The vote at Congress against Peace seems to her of unspeakable importance & horror. She still talks of resigning next year; but we were interrupted in this by a strange attack in one of L.’s eyes; he dashed off to the chemist, & left alone with Margaret I became purely ribald. L. got Fergusson to take out a small fly; came back, & went on again, & M. stayed till the last train. She is a fine specimen of the public woman; a type, after all, no less marked than the literary type, though not yet so fully observed & recorded. Their eccentricities keep me amused, when to tell the truth, I’ve ceased to follow their plots & denunciations. They have the habit of considering themselves driven to death, overwhelmed with work, without a possibility of rest; & never once since I’ve known her has Margaret owned to any state of health save that of being very tired. But these peculiarities are not more than jokes to me; & the directness & superb vigour of her character always overcome me with admiration. Given a keener mind, or a subtler, or some sort of discipline that she’s never had, she might have done marvels. I sometimes guess that she thinks her work less good than it should have been. Or it may be only the terrific shadow of old age, in to which no one, not Roger or Goldie or any of them, can enter without a shudder.

But these remarks on public servants might be written over again for Ka too. She dined with us last night & slept, leaving punctually for her office this morning. With an effort she will talk of other things, but she seems bent & bowed under a load of responsibility, which I believe to be timber at present. In addition, she broods over the war. Her own happiness, I suppose, went out very completely with Rupert’s death; & I fancy she’s making up her mind to a life infinitely poorer & colder than she expected. If this is so, her illusion about the value of a desk in the shipping office, & her hallucination about her own driven, exhausted, harassed condition are merciful. To us, they seemed a little excessive. Its the atmosphere bred in an office as much as anything, the common attitude. She’s been offered a Hall at Newnham. So we all step into the ranks of the middle aged, the responsible people, the burden bearers. It makes me a little melancholy. Failure would keep us young at any rate.

Before tea this afternoon I finished setting up the last words of Katherine’s stories—68 pages."
1918.06.27,"The echoes of the great Charleston affair may still be heard, especially in the region of the kitchen. But it will be needless I hope to take action on their account any more; I wasted Tuesday afternoon writing first a violent & then a pacific letter to Nessa with my version of our Virtue & Trissie’s baseness. L. took proofs meanwhile. The Labour Congress of course makes it impossible to bring that book to a close. L. was there all day yesterday, & had the sensation of Kerensky’s surprise visit. I still find it difficult to make head or tail of Labour party politics, or indeed of any other; but with practice I suppose it wouldn’t be harder than reviewing Mr Merrick. The interest in politics thrives among our friends just now. Adrian & Karin have become rebels & extremists & are seen in every gallery & meeting place. L. had to repeat the whole story twice over after dinner, first for Margaret & then for Bella. Bella is anti-Bolshevik; but the significant thing is that everyone takes some side or other. Everyone makes the state of the country his private affair.

Mrs Woolf & Herbert dined with us on Tuesday. She has, I think, the qualities of a person who has never altogether grown up, in spite of 9 children & all her cares. She gossips & enjoys herself & bursts into tears because she feels she ought to burst into tears; but she tells her memories with spirit, & somehow deals with life very freely & easily & with the liveliest, childlike interest in it all, mixed with the most absurd conventions. She chattered away about her first marriage, & how they’d travelled in Austria, & how she’d had a set of sables, & bought her trousseau at Swan & Edgars. “But Rasselas says the truth—a very fine truth” she observed. “Happiness is never perfect—I’ve never found perfect happiness—always something missing, Virginia,” & there she was taking back a bunch of cornflowers to Bella because it was the anniversary of Dick’s death. Herbert cordial, distant, & detached as usual.

At the Club yesterday I picked up the Times & read of Aunt Minna’s death 2 days ago at Lane End. She is buried there today. She was in her 91st year. A more composed, & outwardly useless life one can’t imagine. She merely lived all that length of time, without adventures, sorrows, difficulties, doubts, actions. She was always unperturbed. I think her great quality was her good sense. She was never in any way absurd or tiresome, & if necessary she would have been a person to ask some sorts of advice from. I saw her a few weeks ago, apparently unaware of death, taking her house for 4 years further, & saying precisely what she’d said any time—about good & bad novels, about George & Margaret & how Dalingridge wasn’t really good country, but of course one mustn’t say so. An elderly toady was with her, who had been a great beauty once, & was still fine looking, & a kind woman, according to Aunt Minna. I expect that the poor old lady was more stoical than she let on: certainly she never seemed selfish or callous; always had her own small affairs which gave her just as much interest as she wanted, & she was too level headed, too clear sighted to pretend for a second to feel more than she did or to ask for expressions of feeling. Gerald I think she was fondest of; his change of mood troubled her a good deal. She was very proud of George & Margaret. She thought it necessary to tell me that at her age she couldn’t ride a bicycle. I believe too much money had always kept her more at a distance from life than was good for her. She was a great supporter of the Duckworth family, & dies the last of them all.
We had a visit from Margaret; which opened with a tremendous broadside of cooperative shop; lamentations, aspirations & too sanguine expectations; all exaggerated, so I felt, in comparison with their real value. The vote at Congress against Peace seems to her of unspeakable importance & horror. She still talks of resigning next year; but we were interrupted in this by a strange attack in one of L.’s eyes; he dashed off to the chemist, & left alone with Margaret I became purely ribald. L. got Fergusson to take out a small fly; came back, & went on again, & M. stayed till the last train. She is a fine specimen of the public woman; a type, after all, no less marked than the literary type, though not yet so fully observed & recorded. Their eccentricities keep me amused, when to tell the truth, I’ve ceased to follow their plots & denunciations.

Before tea this afternoon I finished setting up the last words of Katherine’s stories—68 pages.
"
1918.07.01,"Just back from tea at the Club, laden with 2 cloths had on approval from Souhami’s. L. at the League of Nations. We’ve talked a great deal since I wrote last. First there was the party at the Club on Friday. I came late & met Lytton first & then little Sanger with his name written & pinned to his buttonhole. All sorts of people one half knew from the papers—men with shaggy hair & great eyebrows—women cadaverous or flamboyant—Macdonald, Huysmans, Mrs Despard, Thomas & so on. I was pitched strangely enough into the arms of Widow Creighton who remembered me, she said. Age perhaps has toned her dogmatism. I found her easy enough; a sincere fine old thing, her face emerging out of a mist of flesh, & looking infinitely seamed & worn, like an immensely old sun shining through the mists. She said middle age was happier than youth. I was shot on again. We dined with A. & K.: a good dinner downstairs, & then sat by their open window looking on to Parliament Hill. At 9 we went on to Ray’s party—a dull affair, neither respectable nor bohemian, inundated with Belgians. I talked to Jack [Hills] however; very much like our version of him—emphatic, sententious, & very trusty & kind. I felt him pathetic too; so much seems to have gone wrong for him. On Saturday I went to tea with Janet—but my hand shakes so with carrying parcels that I can’t write."
1918.07.02,"My hand shakes no longer, but my mind vibrates uncomfortably, as it always does after an incursion of visitors; unexpected, & slightly unsympathetic. One’s talked nonsense; one’s ashamed; they’ve been uncomfortable; the contact of one with the other was difficult. I was reading Macaulay’s Life over my tea. (L. seeing Snowden in London) when Mrs Woolf was announced. Edgar & Sylvia called in on their way through Richmond. He is a good deal nicer than she is; as I think I’ve recorded earlier in this book, I take her to be as near the average of her sex, class, & age as may be; given Putney as birthplace, & middle class origin & rather moderate means. The great machine turns out millions like her every year. However they are supplied with a number of ready made remarks into the bargain, so we talked away our 20 minutes,—& now they are gone. But what led him to marry her? “My dear boy” she calls him. I started folding K.M.’s story this afternoon; & went round to the printers, who will only give half a promise to have his press free tomorrow. Every conceivable obstacle is flung across our road, though we do our best to come out this next week. Influenza, which rages all over the place, has come next door."
1918.07.04,"We had a great bout of people yesterday, as we tend to do nowadays. Mary Hutch. Clive, & Borenius. They had been seeing pictures at Sir Cook’s house, & came in later, elegant, frivolous, all garrulous except Mary who scarcely speaks, wanting tea. L. was printing; so I sat in the midst and we engaged in conversation. Borenius is I fancy a good-natured bore of the foreigner type. They tell long very explicit stories, launching out on them on the least provocation; but for one evening it did very well. They dined here; & again we assembled in the drawing room & talked till we could scarcely see each other. B.’s stories filled considerable space; how he’d been made a Count & other stories encroaching upon Asquiths & Cunards. Clive jolly & jovial, cracking his whip & kicking up his heels; & we discussed pictures & jealousy, & derided a good many of our contemporaries. But, as usual, I enjoyed it; L. not quite so much. I took Mary Hutch, over the house; a very shy, or somehow unforthcoming woman; nice I expect, beneath such a fuss & exquisiteness of dress & get up that one has doubts whether she can be nice. She is going to write a story for us, if she can ever leave off scratching it out.

Today, Friday [5 July] L. printed off the last of Prelude, only the title page & dedication still to do. Today the printers machine is running, rather to our alarm, as he seems ignorant of it. We may have his press for £25. Very fine & hot."
1918.07.09,"I cant fill up the lost days, though it is safe to attribute much space in them to printing. The title page was finally done on Sunday. Now I’m in the fury of folding & stapling, so as to have all ready for glueing & sending out tomorrow & Thursday. By rights these processes should be dull; but its always possible to devise some little skill or economy, & the pleasure of profiting by them keeps one content. Yesterday we had a day off, & went, together for a wonder, to Souhami’s; & I hereby make a vow to buy all draperies, covers, cloths, rugs from him in future and never again go near the Omega or the Burnet’s. We have obliterated that painful staring check under a pale green & blue persian cloth—infinitely preferable. L. up in London seeing Bonwick about the dummy copy, & at 17 Club meeting. An Indian is now established in that institution perpetually playing chess. Saxon, by the way dined with us on Saturday, & supplemented this dinner by a long unnecessary intimate discussion of his feelings & health on the telephone. He doesn’t get on with Nick, he says, though Barbara manages all right. I believe he takes natural pleasure in feeling himself preferred in spite of the awkwardnesses. Now to my stapling."
1918.07.10,"We have sent off our first copies this evening, after spending the afternoon in glueing & covering. They surprised us when done by their professional look—the stiff blue cover pleases us particularly. I must read the book through after dinner, partly to find possible faults, but also to make up my mind how much I like it as literature.

Adrian & Karin dined here last night, & he spoke to the Guild on Peace—very composed, clear, well spoken, putting on his spectacles & reading in his pleasant intellectual voice from notes. He has traces of the judicial mind & manner. The women were more stirred than usual, though their reasoning isn’t very very strong; & they are of course ignorant. But they would all have peace tomorrow, on any terms, & abuse our government for leading us on after a plan of its own. When asked to join a Peace Meeting in Hyde Park on Sunday, Mrs Langston, as spokeswoman, intimated that on no account could they violate the Sabbath. What a terrible grip Xtianity still has—she became rigid & bigoted at once, as if God himself had her in his grasp. That I believe is still the chief enemy—the fear of God. But I was tactful enough to keep this view dark. Karin very voluble with her advanced views, though I never see how she comes by them. One can’t trace any passion.

Rain for the first time for weeks today, & a funeral next door; dead of influenza."
1918.07.12,"Just back from the Club, & therefore in the restless state most safely to be appeased by writing; reading, though I’ve Don Juan, the Tragic Comedians, Verrall upon Meredith, Crees upon Meredith, the poems of Heredia & the poems of Laforgue to read, to say nothing of the Autobiography of Tagore, & the life of Macaulay, being out of the question before dinner. Mudies, I confess, sickens me of reading: I feel disinclined even to write, what may become one of these books, so like bales of stuff upon a drapers shelves—only with out the solid merit of good wool. I stood there with the pallid & respectable & got my allowance. Great storms have been beating over England the last 3 days, the result of the Bishop’s importunity, God being, as usual, spiteful in his concessions, & now threatening to ruin the harvest. I owe God a grudge for his effect upon the Guild.

At the Club we met Lytton by appointment, & had tea downstairs, talking mainly of his book, & his success, & the violent attack upon him by Mrs Ward in the Lit. Sup. yesterday. She sees German brutality in his picture of Nightingale & Clough, professing to let the coarse caricature of Arnold pass. How this lights up the stuffed world of the first class railway carriage that she lives in! Lytton is getting Walter Raleigh to answer, though I think nothing short of a coronet will impress her imagination. He stays this week end with the Dutchess of Marlborough, whom he met in the Cunards’ box at the opera; & was fresh from Mrs Asquith. Mrs A. is of opinion that the Autobiography of Haydon is superior to the Confessions of Rousseau. She pressed upon him a copy of Hubert Crackanthorpe’s works. He is under no illusion so far about the brilliancy or desirability of this set as familiars, though very happy & comfortable & mellow in his success. Country Life begs him to continue the series in its pages. Lalla Vandervelde is going to act a play of his. His only anxiety is whether fame will continue. Maynard watches eager for him to be converted; but I see no chance, unless pleasure will be his doom: no, I think he’s safe, & really improved, as I suppose most people are by encouragement.

Yesterday & the day before we spent glueing the book, & have now paid all our debts; so that I suppose a great many tongues are now busy with K.M. I myself find a kind of beauty about the story; a little vapourish I admit, & freely watered with some of her cheap realities; but it has the living power, the detached existence of a work of art. I shall be curious to get other opinions. L. rather gloomy now about the prospects of his Review. Thomas has taken his name off the Board, on the ground that the Trade Unions have the same end in view. This is rather cool, as L. gave them the idea. I have bet 1 shilling that all will be settled by Oct. 1st; & L. editor; & the Review in being."
1918.07.16,"On Saturday [13 July] we took it into our head to do a little marketing, since the book is off our hands temporarily; & so went to Kingston with a basket, but found peas & beans much the same price there as here. L. bought a vellum Grotius at a bookshop which promised better than it produced.

On Sunday, a wettish cloudy day as all these days have been since the Duke of Rutland fell on his knees, we went to Staines to say goodbye to Philip who has notice to go to the front on Monday. I cant help having a good deal of sympathy with my mother in law, not only in this parting but in her general attitude to life. It is so lacking in self-consciousness; & has a natural kind of rightness & wisdom, though she never says a clever thing, & in fact says many foolish ones, & her conventions are so absurd that they scarcely count. We walked up & down a narrow lane between beds of Herbert’s vegetables; & she cried; & laughed; & then gave me 2 large eggs; & ran about among all her children, very lively & haphazard, & affectionate, evidently liking this sort of miscellaneous company of sons & their wives better than anything on earth. But to give this effect I should need a chapter, & rather hope one of these days to take one.

Monday, was as usual a day for London & tea at the Club. I was so foolish as to fritter 3/—1/6 on the blue penholder with which I write, &, when I dont write suck; 1/6 on paper, at a grossly extravagant shop in Pall Mall. I justified these extravagances by the fact that you can get into the National Gallery for nothing. I spent an hour wandering there, & then came back & tried to describe my impressions to Vanessa. But I see why I like pictures; its as things that stir me to describe them; but then only certain pictures do this; & I insist (for the sake of my aesthetic soul) that I don’t want to read stories or emotions or anything of the kind into them; only pictures that appeal to my plastic sense of words make me want to have them for still life in my novel. But the atmosphere of picture galleries, always gloomy, is worse than ever now, when the glory of war has to be taught by a life size portrait of Lord Kitchener, & almost life size battle scenes; though as the battles are 18th century battles, one can only look upon them as scenes in a gymnasium on rather a large scale. I forget now who was at the Club for tea; but one may still safely seat Alix in one chair, & dress her in green gray coat & skirt with a leather belt round her waist, & a despatch box by her side. As she’s not doing work for Alix one can’t tell whats in the despatch box.

Tuesday was a day when I stayed at home & folded & stapled paper. A French secretary from Mr David Davies interrupted me. L. makes Tuesday a kind of receptacle for shooting meetings into.

On Wednesday 17th we glued 50 copies of Prelude. So far our present supply is ample. It seems doubtful whether we shall sell more than a hundred. Clive writes a tolerant but not enthusiastic letter about it. “Doesn’t set the Thames on fire, or turn his fastidious head” so he says. Bob Trevelyan dined with us, & Adrian came in late. Bob has been through the great crisis of his life—which will find him in talk for many a day. He has escaped the army, & may now go either to France or Holland. His literary work is interrupted very seriously. He upset me so by his statement that in his absence Bessy would “live with Crompton Davies—I mean stay with him.—In fact she’s there tonight to see how she likes it—” that I did nothing but laugh, at discreet intervals. Leonard & Adrian joined in. He is a ridiculous figure precisely like the false Mandrill, especially now that he’s bent with the rheumatic, & can only creep & crawl. He is one of our egoists; what’s more he manages to be more malevolent than anyone I know, under a cover of extreme good nature. He reminds me of the man with the pointed stick, who picks up scraps of paper. So Bob collects every scrap of gossip within reach—& even stretches after those that are still beyond his reach. He told me that “he’d heard I was taking my book about to publishers”, who presumably, refuse to take it. Then he lamented the failure of K.M.’s story; accepting my corrections of both statements, but so half heartedly that he’ll repeat them wherever he goes. He insisted, too that he had met me at the Verralls’, when he was an undergraduate in the 90ties—And he rambled over a long argument about great musicians & great writers; & he praised our friends books with one breath & found rather more fault than he had given praise with the other. But his relish of all this gossip & malevolence is such that you can’t grudge it him. He went off at 9.30 this morning with L. & talked all the way up in the train about his experiences before the Tribunal."
1918.07.18,"L. spent 3 hours trying to make sense of Sir Willoughby Dickinson & the rest; & at 4 I met him in the Reading Room of the London Library. First, however, I met a milk white horse in St James’ Square, wearing an ancient Spanish saddle, mounted upon red embroidered velvet. An old men led it. No sign of advertisement was visible. Perhaps some great Duke rides abroad like this. We went on to tea at the Club—& what a tea! Two dry biscuits, so that we had to resort to cake on coming home. All the copies that we glued yesterday have gone white in the back. We dont know the cause. Richmond rang up to offer me Rupert’s Life for next week. I told him that I should like to explain Rupert to the public. He agreed that there was much misunderstanding. “He was a very jolly sort of fellow”; he said. I’m trying to get letters out of James.

The Germans are not succeeding this time, & the weather is windy, hot, violently wet, & sunny all in turn. We are once more getting safe through the moon."
1918.07.23,"I think it was on Friday that I was given my green glass jar by the chemist—for nothing! Its a jar I’ve always coveted; since glass is the best of all decorations, holding the light & changing it. At Lewes for round jars, the chemist asks £2.2. On Friday anyhow, Jack Hills & Pippa dined here. All went very easily & freely. Jack has weathered life with great credit, upheld so Pippa says, by his human sympathies, & turned by them in the direction of woman’s suffrage, reform, education for the poor & so on, though remaining nominally a conservative. I’m somehow reminded of an excellent highly polished well seasoned brown boot by the look of him. He always seems fresh from the country. He gave us a long & very vivid account of his campaigning, from which one could easily gather his immense virtues as leader of men. To my surprise too, he knows about Georgian poetry, & has read Lytton’s book, & condemns the Victorians. Perhaps one was inclined to be supercilious; to confound him with George & Gerald. Pippa spent the night. She appreciates Waller immensely. We talked about the future of women next morning. She is head of a kind of exchange for finding places & training women who want work, & sees the future in those terms of course.

On Saturday [20 July] we went to Tidmarsh. From the point of view of country there is nothing that we at least can say for it; though the house & garden are nice enough. The river brings such a flood of cheap humanity down to it; red villas perched everywhere; people spending the week end at Pangbourne with leather cases & fishing rods. Lytton & Carrington were alone. No servant was visible & most of the waiting seemed to be done by Carrington. She is silent, a little subdued, makes one conscious of her admiring & solicitous youth. If one were concerned for her, one might be anxious about her position—so dependent on L. & having so openly burnt the conventional boats. She is to run her risk & take her chances evidently. Lytton was fresh from the Dss of Marlborough & Dabernon, who is taking his play in hand. Whatever there is in the way of London society is, I suppose now open to him. He is making his investigations not with a view to a permanent settlement; rather to round off his view of human nature. He declares he knows more different sorts of people than any of us; but we disputed this. A great deal of talk about Rupert. The book is a disgraceful sloppy sentimental rhapsody, leaving Rupert rather tarnished. Lytton very amusing, charming, benignant, & like a father to C. She kisses him & waits on him & gets good advice & some sort of protection. He came up with us on Monday, to lunch with Dabernon. Margaret dined with us. I lay on the sofa & caught only a few unintelligible phrases.

Tuesday. L. went as usual to his committees. There are difficulties about the Review. Macdonald wants to make it part of his Socialist Review. Then there are difficulties about the League of Nations. Unwin is bringing out the Cooperation book, but all these movements are as difficult & as much hindered by jealousies and spites as well can be."
1918.07.27,"As usual, this diary has skipped a day or two. But first one must pause to say that here a new volume starts, the third, & therefore there is every appearance of a long, though intermittent life. If it survives the summer, when the evenings are unfavourable to writing, it should flourish in the winter. Perhaps the lack of coal may kill it. We may have to live entirely at the 17 Club. But to look ahead is disastrous, considering how much has still to be recorded of time past. On Wednesday [24 July], I had one of my field days. To London, first to meet James at the Club. He was to tell me about Rupert for my article. His first words however were, “Have you heard of Ka’s engagement?” “To Hilton?” I asked. “No, to Arnold Forster.” This annoyed me considerably. I am glad that she should marry, though she bade fair to be a marked spinster, but marriage with W.A.F. will be merely a decorous & sympathetic alliance, making her more of a servant of the state than ever. Then, as James had a medical examination, we couldn’t say much about Rupert, save that he was jealous, moody, ill-balanced, all of which I knew, but can hardly say in writing. Fredegond appeared next; I took her half way to Charing Cross. She had been having confidences from Alix, & was in the flood of affection for her. These emotions are too much in the Fisher spirit for my comfort. Her poems are soon coming out. Then, having spread my rumour about Ka, which only comes through Bob, through a letter from A.F. & thus may not be true, & I hope it isn’t, I went up to Gordon Sqre; where the vans were taking the furniture, Nessa in & out of the room all the time; & of course Clive & Mary appeared; & then everything goes over the same little rapids. We all dined at the Mont Blanc. Clive has never forgiven me—for what? I see that he is carefully following a plan in his relations with me—& resents any attempt to distract him from it. His personal remarks always seem to be founded on some reserve of grievance, which he has decided not to state openly.

“You’ve wrecked one of my best friendships” he remarked; “by your habit of describing facts from your own standpoint—”

“What you call God’s Truth” said Nessa.

“One couldn’t have an intimacy with you & anyone else at the same time—You describe people as I paint pots.”

“You put things in curl, & they come out afterwards” Mary murmured from the shadow of her sympathetic silence.

Clive however had bitterness of some sort in what he said. He meant me to see that somehow I had ended our old relations—& now all is second best. It was clear also that he lives in dread of some alliance between Mary & me which shall threaten his position with her. He protested that to show her letters of his would be unfair, on my part or on Nessa’s. She is a blank book after our much written, rewritten & scratched out torn out pages. The situation is complicated & delicate enough. He can’t make up his mind to cut adrift from me altogether. But he paid for my dinner, & we wound up good temperedly. The rain pelted down, & I rushed for my train. I wish I had had the patience to write down the more intelligent parts of our talk: criticism of books & life, & not of people & feelings. But I become too critical of badly written criticism, & write so hurriedly that it would certainly be bad.

On Thursday we had a day off; in which we glued some more copies of Prelude; I think only one more order has come in. People complain that though clever & all that, the story isn’t complete.

On Friday, 26th, L. went on his round of League of Nations, & Club. I to Omega for Roger’s new paper, to Gordon Sqre for pictures, & then, laden intolerably, to the Club for tea. By rights of importance I should remark that today L. was asked to stand for Parliament. I haven’t yet turned my mind that way. A natural disposition to think Parliament ridiculous routs serious thought. But perhaps it is’nt so ridiculous as speeches make one suppose. Journalists were given tea at the Club. I went upstairs, hid behind a door, & saw Mrs Hamilton for the first time, or rather heard her, holding forth like a jolly club man; for I didn’t dare look.

James to dinner. He promises to send us Rupert’s letters to typewrite at Asheham; but some queer Strachey intrigue is at work on the matter.
"
1918.07.29,"I’m paralysed by the task of describing a week end at Garsington. I suppose we spoke some million words between us; listened to a great many more, chiefly from the mouth of Mrs Hamilton, who strains at her collar like a spaniel dog, & has indeed the large hazel staring eyes of one of them. There was Gertler; Shearman & Dallas for tea; Brett. Ottoline, 3 children & Philip. The string which united everything from first to last was Philip’s attack upon Murry in The Nation for his review of Sassoon. He was half proud of himself & half uncomfortable; at any rate, I was taxed with being on Murry’s side before 10 minutes was out; & then to prove his case Philip read Murry’s article, his letter, & his letter to Murry, three times over, so I thought, emphasising his points, & lifting his finger to make us attend. And there was Sassoon’s letter of gratitude too. I think Ott. was a little bored. Happily the weather was fine, the food good, & we flowed about happily enough, & without serious boredom, which is more than one can ask of a week-end. In fact, for some reason I was rather well content. My bed was like layer upon layer of the most springy turf; & then the garden is almost melodramatically perfect, with its grey oblong pool, & pink farm buildings, its soft whitish grey stone & enormous smooth dense green yew hedges. Down these paths we wandered; once or twice with Ott.; once with Mrs Hamilton. She is a working brain worker. Hasn’t a penny of her own; & has the anxious hard working brain of a professional, earning her living all the time. I’m not sure though that she didn’t compare very well with Ott. Some time after tea we three meandered off “to the woods”. But we never got there of course. Ott. sat upon a gate very soon & discussed the character of Ly Margaret Sackville; & as usual Ott. deplored & marvelled at the very characteristics which, one would have said, she knew at first hand. However, her drift is always almost bewilderingly meandering; & I believe she often doesn’t know her own motives for taking a special line. The difficulty is that anyone listening perceives some motive unconfessed; & this gives her talk rather a distracting wearying effect. Halfway up a hill in the sun, she stopped, leant on her parasol, looked vaguely across the landscape, & began a discourse upon love. Some wind seems to blow half her words away—another reason for finding her difficult to listen to—

“Isn’t it sad that no one really falls in love nowadays? Its the rarest, rarest thing—I mean they dont see each other ideally. They dont feel that every word is something too wonderful just because the other has spoken it. Bertie does of course—but then his choice is so often unfortunate.”

Here, chiefly in order to get us home, I said that love meant a great many different things; & that to confine it to romantic love was absurd. I also maintained that one could love groups of people, & landscapes. Unluckily this remark led Ott. to lean on her parasol once more, & look longingly at a wheatfield.

“Yes. I love that—just for itself—the curve of that wheatfield seems to me as divine as any human being. I’ve always been like that ever since I can remember. I love literature too—”

“I love quite absurd things—the I.L.P. for instance”, said Mrs Hamilton.

At last we got moving again, & we asked the poor old ninny why, with this passion for literature, she didnt write.

“Ah, but I’ve no time—never any time. Besides, I have such wretched health—But the pleasure of creation, Virginia, must transcend all others.”

I said it certainly did; though I think the remark ought to have been made to include Mrs Hamilton too. We trailed back through the village, where all the peasants were lounging in the road, with their pipes & their dogs & their babies. The most affable, & I’m afraid, obsequious greetings were exchanged; the dazzling appearance of Ott. & her pearls seeming to strike the agricultural labourer neither as wrong nor ridiculous, but as part of the aristocratic show that he’d paid for. No one laughed. Old ladies in black were eager to stop & talk about the hot weather. They seemed all a little excited & very anxious to please. “Very nice people, aren’t they?” she said when we came in; & I daresay nothing for the next 300 years will make them otherwise.

I was taken to Gertler’s studio & shown his solid ‘unrelenting’ teapot (to use Brett’s word). He is a resolute young man; & if good pictures can be made by willing them to be good, he may do wonders. No base motive could have its way with him; & for this reason I haven’t great faith in him. Its too moral & intellectual an affair; or perhaps the natural gift is not abundant enough to cover his conscience & will power. He says straight out what he thinks, sits very upright; everything tight curled, tense, muscular about him; his art an agony often, as he told me. But at last he understands that he wishes to paint form in the brightest colours. Form obsesses him. He sees a lamp as an imminent dominant overwhelming mass of matter. Ever since he was a child the solidity & the shapes of objects have tortured him. I advised him, for arts sake, to keep sane; to grasp, & not exaggerate, & put sheets of glass between him & his matter. This, so he said, is now his private wish. But he can think pianola music equal to hand made, since it shows the form, & the touch & the expression are nothing."
1918.07.31,"Arrived at Asheham. I sit as if in the open air—the drawing room providing only a shell of shade in the intense heat. The air dances over the field; & the smoke of the farm on the meadows mixes with the haze. The garden is overgrown, & the flowers crushed out. However, at this moment L. is cutting our beans for dinner.

We spent yesterday doing jobs in London. I saw a dead horse on the pavement—a literal case of what politicians call dying in harness, & rather pathetic to me—to die in Oxford Street one hot afternoon, & to have been only a van horse; & by the time I passed back again he was removed. This shows what my business was. Mudies. The Club. I loitered past jewellers windows looking for a stone to replace my sapphire lost in the train going to Garsington. Pale cracked emeralds of doubtful value tempt me greatly. Lytton & Alix at the Club—the last scene of that familiar drama. Lytton was on his way to catch a train. Alix, I suppose, never catches them. Terrible though it is to think of, she is sitting in the 17 Club at this moment—a kind of Fate, surveying the passage of moral generations. Lytton had lunch with Lord D’Abernon together with Lord Ribblesdale & a vulgar appreciative little manager, who asked to read his Chinese play & gave hopes of producing it. Lytton affects to think poorly of it. I’ve forgotten what I think. I complimented him on the change in Carrington—he has improved her. “Ah, but the future is very dark—I must be free. I shall want to go off.” I suggested that she might follow suit, which did not perhaps quite please him. In the street we passed Oliver & the flashing Inez; & were then stopped by Kot. who wanted us to come & meet D. H. Lawrence—or perhaps to ask him here. Kot’s blood shot eyes, & general sordidity struck us, in the middle of St James Square. He is a mysterious figure—not only in his occupations, but in his desire to be a friend of ours, though he seems without many friends. Anyhow, he was the last person we saw in London, since Mr Cox of the London Library doesn’t count.

Today the servants were off by a 7 o’clock train; & we came by Clapham, & meant to go by East Grinstead, but found places in the Lewes train after all, & got to Glynde about 2.30—not a bad journey. Everyone congratulated themselves on finding room at all, after the rumours about crowds that have been put about. In my carriage we were “a family party”, according to the extremely capable, friendly dogmatic Jew business man who took us in charge. These are queer meetings; so impressed on one at the time; then so rubbed out. Already I’ve half forgotten the soldier with the nickel knee plate & the metal arch to his foot, though he talked at the top of his voice, & boasted, & made me hate him; & I have forgotten the women with children, who drank a few drops of whiskey, & how we were all offered drinks of tea, & bites of sandwiches—& were helpful & kindly & on our best manly & womanly behaviour. We ate our lunch under some trees coming from Glynde."
1918.08.03,"There’s nothing but rustic news to record, since as we expected the Murrys have put us off. Katherine writes that she’s ill. I cant help guessing that she may be rather hopelessly ill. Anyhow its out of the question that she should come here. The weather hasn’t held good. Yesterday was as wet a day as England often produces. Almost always the afternoon is dry in England; & so it was more or less. We went mushrooming in the evening, & got a handkerchief full. So one of our great excitements has begun again. One ripe blackberry was found at the top. As I lay in the grass a hare loped past me. Perhaps we’re rather pleased to be alone after all.

Better weather today, though a black sky is about the ugliest thing in nature. L. to Lewes. He went to fetch a parcel from the New Statesman which wasn’t there. I round M.’s walk, & over the top. My record must be solely of beetles & butterflies. A ray of sun brings out the brown heaths in any number. Over Newhaven an airship floated, & the sky being blue for a space the sea was too. It struck me as odd to think of all the blazing blue safely burning behind the clouds; & how a ray on the earth made a different place of it. I must go and pick ’shrooms, the sun being out."
1918.08.04,"While waiting to buy a book in which to record my impressions first of Christina Rossetti, then of Byron, I had better write them here. For one thing I have hardly any money left, having bought Leconte de Lisle, in great quantities. Christina has the great distinction of being a born poet, as she seems to have known very well herself. But if I were bringing a case against God she is one of the first witnesses I should call. It is melancholy reading. First she starved herself of love, which meant also life; then of poetry in deference to what she thought her religion demanded. There were two good suitors. The first indeed had his peculiarities. He had a conscience. She could only marry a particular shade of Christian. He could only stay that shade for a few months at a time. Finally he developed Roman Catholicism & was lost. Worse still was the case of Mr Collins—a really delightful scholar—an unwordly recluse—a single minded worshipper of Christina, who could never be brought into the fold at all. On this account she could only visit him affectionately in his lodgings, which she did to the end of her life. Poetry was castrated too. She would set herself to do the psalms into verse; & to make all her poetry subservient to the Christian doctrines. Consequently, as I think, she starved into austere emaciation, a very fine original gift, which only wanted licence to take to itself a far finer form than, shall we say, Mrs Browning’s. She wrote very easily; in a spontaneous childlike kind of way one imagines, as is the case generally with a true gift; still undeveloped. She has the natural singing power. She thinks too. She has fancy. She could, one is profane enough to guess, have been ribald & witty. And, as a reward for all her sacrifices, she died in terror, uncertain of salvation. I confess though that I have only turned her poetry over, making my way inevitably to the ones I knew already."
1918.08.07,"Asheham diary drains off my meticulous observations of flowers, clouds, beetles & the price of eggs; &, being alone, there is no other event to record. Our tragedy has been the squashing of a caterpillar; our excitement the return of the servants from Lewes last night, laden with all L.’s war books & the English review for me, with Brailsford upon a League of Nations, & Katherine Mansfield on Bliss. I threw down Bliss with the exclamation, “She’s done for!” Indeed I dont see how much faith in her as woman or writer can survive that sort of story. I shall have to accept the fact, I’m afraid, that her mind is a very thin soil, laid an inch or two deep upon very barren rock. For Bliss is long enough to give her a chance of going deeper. Instead she is content with superficial smartness; & the whole conception is poor, cheap, not the vision, however imperfect, of an interesting mind. She writes badly too. And the effect was as I say, to give me an impression of her callousness & hardness as a human being. I shall read it again; but I dont suppose I shall change. She’ll go on doing this sort of thing, perfectly to her & Murry’s satisfaction. I’m relieved now that they didn’t come. Or is it absurd to read all this criticism of her personally into a story?

Anyhow I was very glad to go on with my Byron. He has at least the male virtues. In fact, I’m amused to find how easily I can imagine the effect he had upon women—especially upon rather stupid or uneducated women, unable to stand up to him. So many too, would wish to reclaim him. Ever since I was a child (as Gertler would say, as if it proved him a particularly remarkable person,) I’ve had the habit of getting full of some biography, & wanting to build up my imaginary figure of the person with every scrap of news I could find about him. During the passion, the name of Cowper or Byron or whoever it might be, seemed to start up in the most unlikely pages. And then, suddenly, the figure becomes distant & merely one of the usual dead. I’m much impressed by the extreme badness of B.’s poetry—such of it as Moore quotes with almost speechless admiration. Why did they think this Album stuff the finest fire of poetry? It reads hardly better than L.E.L. or Ella Wheeler Wilcox. And they dissuaded him from doing what he knew he could do which was to write satire. He came home from the East with satires (parodies of Horace) in his bag & Childe Harold. He was persuaded that Childe Harold was the best poem ever written. But he never as a young man, believed in his poetry; a proof, in such a confident dogmatic person, that he hadn’t the gift. The Wordsworths & Keats’ believe in that as much as they believe in anything. In his character, I’m often reminded a little of Rupert Brooke, though this is to Rupert’s disadvantage. At any rate Byron had superb force; his letters prove it. He had in many ways a very fine nature too; though as no one laughed him out of his affectations, he became more like Horace Cole than one could wish. He could only be laughed at by a woman, & they worshipped instead. I haven’t yet come to Lady Byron, but I suppose, instead of laughing, she merely disapproved. And so he became Byronic."
1918.08.09,"In the absence of human interest, which makes us peaceful & content, one may as well go on with Byron. Having indicated that I am ready, after a century, to fall in love with him, I suppose my judgment of Don Juan may be partial. It is the most readable poem of its length ever written, I suppose; a quality which it owes in part to the springy random haphazard galloping nature of its method. This method is a discovery by itself. Its what one has looked for in vain—a⁠[n] elastic shape which will hold whatever you choose to put into it. Thus he could write out his mood as it came to him; he could say whatever came into his head. He wasn’t committed to be poetical; & thus escaped his evil genius of the false romantic & imaginative. When he is serious he is sincere; & he can impinge upon any subject he likes. He writes 16 canto’s without once flogging his flanks. He had, evidently, the able witty mind of what my father Sir Leslie would have called a thoroughly masculine nature. I maintain that these illicit kind of books are far more interesting than the proper books which respect illusions devoutly all the time. Still, it doesn’t seem an easy example to follow; & indeed like all free & easy things, only the skilled & mature really bring them off successfully. But Byron was full of ideas—a quality that gives his verse a toughness, & drives me to little excursions over the surrounding landscape or room in the middle of my reading. And tonight I shall have the pleasure of finishing him—though why, considering that I’ve enjoyed almost every stanza, this should be a pleasure I really dont know. But so it always is, whether the books a good book or a bad book. Maynard Keynes admitted in the same way that he always cuts off the advertisements at the end with one hand while he’s reading, so as to know exactly how much he has to get through.

Everyone so far has failed us: Katherine ill: Ka & Will A.F. obliged to work next Sunday; so, in a wild desire to couple Bonwick with someone who will mitigate his tedium, we’ve wired both to Marjorie Strachey & Mrs Hamilton. Rather wickedly I dwelt to Marjorie, upon the fair hair of B. but she has drawn it upon herself by her confession, or rather statement, that she intends to marry."
1918.08.12,"(I believe this is near about the anniversary of our wedding day, 6 years ago) [10 August 1912]. Bonwick came; but Marjorie & Mrs Hamilton only sent telegrams. Being a man of business he made the most of his holiday, & came toiling up the hill to find us, where we were picking blackberries. A straight commonplace rigid kind of man; impervious to anything at all different from the usual. Going down the hill he told us that he spent a fifth of his income on Prisoners of War, in order to justify his exemption as a C.O. Our talk was almost wholly about The Nation. It was his only topic. The poor man has a strong Cockney accent; a perservering aspiring selfsatisfied mind, making great play with his literary connections, & pretending to be the most important part of “We” when he speaks, as he always does, of the Nation. To tell the truth, I got my first inkling of the lure of gold through hearing him talk. He gave out that he deals in hundreds & thousands. They are Rowntree’s hundreds & thousands, but Mr B. has the easy powerful air of one who deals in them. “Rowntree asked me if the Nation could afford it (1000 a year) & I said yes. So he did it—Yes, we pay our writers increased rates now. Hobson chanced to say that he had never made so little by the Nation, so I told Rowntree the fees ought to be raised.” I imagine him sitting at a desk in an ante room & opening the door for people who want to see Massingham. He told us that Mrs Phillimore has been offered £500 for a book of her religious sketches. He told us lots of gossip, how Edward Garnett was turned out; & how they got scores of letters against Roger’s articles; & madmen write to them “I am the son of God”. But I was more impressed by his commercial bearing than by his anecdotes. He told them a little as if he were superior to all these literary people—(but I confess that the mosquitoes are biting my toes, & a moth is dropping perpetually from the lamp, so that I can’t remember all the things I meant to say about Mr Bonwick. Leonard is staying with him at “my place” near Croydon tonight, & goes tomorrow to York to see Rowntree. L. declares that the profound psychologist would find B. chiefly remarkable for a complete lack of humour."
1918.08.16,"My visit to Charleston & L.’s to York are both partly responsible for this skip. But I’ve skipped too much to give a very full account of one or of the other. Bonwick’s villa precisely expresses Bonwick: & a stuffy smell thrown in; windows curtained in thick white; pictures of Niagara. They spent 17 hours in travelling to York & back; & the result, still to await another meeting of Trustees, though Bonwick is sure they mean to agree. The Labour people are to be dropped. My visit to Charleston was spent mostly in sitting in the drawing⁠[room] & talking to N. while she made herself a small brown coat. Duncan wandered in & out; sometimes digging a vegetable bed, sometimes painting a watercolour of bedroom china, pinned to a door. In the evening there was the lumpish Bunny, inclined to be surly; & N. inclined to take him up sharply. What did we discuss? There was Ka’s engagement, concerning which Duncan had a good deal to say; one of his statements being that A.-F. is 45, & always has been. Another is that he lent to certain affections & practised them in an Italian villa. I made out a description of Garsington. The hunger of poor Ottoline for some recognition in Sussex is proved by her offering herself for any day in the summer after July 8th. She was abruptly told that none suited—which explains her eagerness to insert her foot here. Then we discussed the A⁠[drian], S⁠[tephen]’s: he a dead weight, & she a live one, according to N. who warns me we shall repent of asking them here—this in front of Duncan too, who said nothing to contradict. So our relationships change, imperceptibly enough. When N. & I were alone, I supposed we discussed the two parrokeets & money, which is not any longer such a distant, speculative sort of commodity as it used to be—at least to her. We discussed the children too; the sort of talk that runs on when one knows all the facts, but wishes to ascertain how they’ve changed position—What for instance is Lytton’s view of Mrs Asquith; & hers of him; & Maynard’s of them both. Gertler’s notions of painting: his views of their painting; Duncan’s fame: Bunny’s socialism. Bunny thus defines his position: all capitalists are wrong; therefore for him to live upon Vanessa is good, inasmuch as she enjoys money that she has no right to, & could not possibly spend her interest better than by maintaining him. This evolved from a sentimental declaration by him that he ought to spend his life in giving honey to his friends for nothing. His brain must be a tangle of sentiments & half-realised socialism. I bicycled back on Wednesday & found L. & we were very happy, until it came to the fat bacon—when, alas—!"
1918.08.19,"Its possible that we may have solved the problem of having visitors—not to see them. At this moment A. & K. are in the house, as an occasional sound from the drawing room proves. But we only meet at meals; so that it is possible to think of things to say in the intervals. I find that deafness imposes itself upon the mind as well as the voice; it frightens away the quicker shyer deeper thoughts so that all the talk that reaches a deaf person must be of the same hearty, plain, matter of fact kind. Try as one will, one can’t do otherwise. Carrington came for the weekend. She is the easiest of visitors as she never stops doing things—pumping, scything, or walking. I suspect part of this is intentional activity, lest she should bore; but it has its advantages. After trudging out here, she trudged to Charleston, & only came in at eleven last night, just as we were shutting the windows. Poor lugubrious Bunny escorted her, protesting that a 10 mile walk was nothing compared to the joy of having some one to talk to. She trudged off again this morning to pack Lytton’s box or buy him a hair brush in London—a sturdy figure, dressed in a print dress, made after the pattern of one in a John picture; a thick mop of golden red hair, & a fat decided clever face, with staring bright blue eyes. The whole just misses, but decidedly misses what might be vulgarity. She seems to be an artist—seems, I say, for in our circle the current that way is enough to sweep people with no more art in them than Barbara in that direction. Still, I think Carrington cares for it genuinely, partly because of her way of looking at pictures.

I finished by the way The Electra of Sophocles, which has been dragging on down here, though it’s not so fearfully difficult after all. The thing that always impresses me fresh is the superb nature of the story. It seems hardly possible not to make a good play of it. This perhaps is the result of having traditional plots which have been made & improved & freed from superfluities by the polish of innumerable actors & authors & critics, till it becomes like a lump of glass worn smooth in the sea. Also, if everyone in the audience knows beforehand what is going to happen, much finer & subtler touches will tell, & words can be spared. At anyrate my feeling always is that one can’t read too carefully, or attach enough weight to every line & hint; & that the apparent bareness is only on the surface. There does, however, remain the question of reading the wrong emotions into the text. I am generally humiliated to find how much Jebb is able to see; my only doubt is whether he doesn’t see too much—as I think one might do with a bad modern English play if one set to work. Finally, the particular charm of Greek remains as strong & as difficult to account for as ever. One feels the immeasurable difference between the text & the translation with the first words. The heroic woman is much the same in Greece & England. She is of the type of Emily Brontë. Clytaemnestra & Electra are clearly mother & daughter, & therefore should have some sympathy, though perhaps sympathy gone wrong breeds the fiercest hate. E. is the type of woman who upholds the family above everything; the father. She has more veneration for tradition than the sons of the house; feels herself born of the father’s side, & not of the mother’s. Its strange to notice how, although the conventions are perfectly false & ridiculous, they never appear petty or undignified, as our English conventions are constantly made to do. Electra lived a far more hedged in life than the women of the mid Victorian age, but this has no effect upon her, except in making her harsh & splendid. She could not go out for a walk alone; with us it would be a case of a maid & a hansom cab."
1918.08.24,"I had to look carefully before I wrote Saturday; stranger still one won’t know that its Sunday tomorrow, I suppose. If I weren’t too lazy I think I should try to describe the country; but then I shouldn’t get it right. I shouldn’t bring back to my own eyes the look of all those old beautiful very worn carpets which are spread over the lower slopes of the hills; nor should I convey the look of clouded emerald which the downs wear, the semi-transparent look, as the sun & shadows change, & the green becomes now vivid now opaque. However I confess that I shirk almost equally the task which has accumulated for 7 days of describing our visitors. They are with us for another week, so I need not try to hit them this very moment. Bridge has broken down the partition between our sitting rooms. L. is playing at this moment, 5.40, binding himself to stop at 6; but it is doubtful if he will. I hesitate a little to write evil of my guests, nor do I think evil—exactly. I refer, in rather crablike fashion, to something coarse, material, insensitive about Karin. One would never find much interest in her; though nothing despicable or mean. No: but she’s a capable American, who will get all that can be had for the asking; & nothing that can’t. I have a theory that if one sense fails another does double work; she eats enormously. She has no concealed vices. Would she be more interesting if she had? She is not stupid; or dull; or trivial; on the contrary she is bright, capable & stirring: stirring Adrian to read books upon economics, & even stirring him to learn shorthand which according to her is useful in a literary career. She intends him to have a career. At any rate she is going to ask for that, too; for certainly Adrian will never ask for anything for himself. Yet (I confess it is “yet” to me) he is happy; gives one the sense of being well provided for, as he provides her with good manners, good looks, & good taste. I feel myself frightfully superior, so refined as to be almost apologetic to Leonard; so full of fine feelings, sub⁠[t]⁠le perceptions, intellectual tastes & the rest that I almost blush to sit here alone, writing or reading Milton. She informs me that I with my tastes would have much in common with Hope Mirrlees; “with my tastes” indeed! This account emphasises our points of difference; outwardly we are all good friends, talkative & in agreement, & not relying on gossip merely to despatch dinner with. We talk about the Labour party, & politics, & anarchy, & government. She understands an argument, deals with an article manfully—And in her way she’s a nice honest creature, not so sure of herself when it comes to taste; & knowing it too—though taste has led her, alas, to embroider a pair of shoes which A. obediently wears. I must leave what I have to say about Milton, the German prisoners, life, & other subjects for next time."
1918.08.27,"Now I confess that I have half forgotten what I meant to say about the German prisoners; Milton & life. I think it was that? (all I can remember now (Friday, Aug. 30th) is that the existence of life in another human being is as difficult to realise as a play of Shakespeare when the book is shut. This occurred to me when I saw Adrian talking to the tall German prisoner. By rights they should have been killing each other. The reason why it is easy to kill another person must be that one’s imagination is too sluggish to conceive what his life means to him—the infinite possibilities of a succession of days which are furled in him, & have already been spent. However, I forget how this was to go on. The prisoner, who looks very lean & hopeless, seemed to like talking; I met him later & we smiled, but the sentry was not there.

Here we are almost at the end of August, & finishing off A. & K.’s visit. They go to Charleston tomorrow. Its odd how in a visit of this kind one wears through different stages. My stages are on the whole nearer to warmth & liking than to irritation; though there is an element of criticism in our relationship, based partly on K.’s manners, appetite & appearance. Which last, poor woman, she can’t altogether help; still there seems no need to emphasise the natural process by an orange dressing gown, held in by a broad band. Her appetite is frankly a schoolboy’s. “What beef!” she exclaimed today. “Dont you feel elated at the sight of good meat?” Meals add a sort of romance to her life such as I in [my] way get, shall we say, from the post or the newspapers. I can imagine Karin, for instance, thinking with a little thrill that next day is the day for salt beef; as I think perhaps I shall get my book from the Times, or an interesting letter. L. on the other hand, is irritated, & being irritated by superficial disagreeables finds deeper causes for them than I altogether agree with. Our usual method is to begin “Why did Adrian marry her?” Then I say “I can quite understand it—she has energy” & so on. Then L. says “I’d a thousand times rather have married Ka—In fact I’d rather have married any one in the whole world. I couldn’t sit in the same room with her.” Still, I do see why Adrian married her. First & foremost she makes him like other people. He has always, I believe, a kind of suspicion that whereas other people are professionals, he remains an amateur. She provides him with household, children, bills, daily life, so that to all appearances he is just like other people. I believe he needs constant reassurance on this point; & takes constant delight in her substantiality. Yes, one wants to be found doing the ordinary things when one’s friends call. I too have this feeling to some extent. I suppose indeed that I share many of A.’s feelings. A feeling comes over me when I am with him that instead of being comfortably obtuse we are crepuscular to each other; & thus, among other things, fearfully shy when we are alone. With other people in the room we get on much better. We had a walk to the post marked by those cloggings of the wheels, which are so discomfiting; nothing seems possible; then with an odious jerk one jars on again. This was better managed than of old. He lost his diffidence & air of hearing himself talk when he told me about Karin; how deaf she is, & how depressed she gets, & how she thinks that people won’t talk loud on purpose, & thus dislikes all Stracheys & others of the low voiced mumbling family. He is very proud of her vitality. I suppose it provides him with a good deal of the stuff of life, which he does not provide for himself.

Yesterday, 22nd, I bicycled to Charleston, lunched, & came home in the evening. It was the first autumn day, warm, softly blue, & blurred with haze. Duncan spent the night before with us. He stumbled along until, by means which he only knows the secret of, he had us all laughing until the tears came. His chief effort was a description of Lady Strachey reading aloud Laurence Housman’s The Dying ploughboy speaks from the Grave—

“I hear the bells jingling, & I lie in my mothers bed. The finest poem in the language too.” Then we discussed the bursting of people’s bladders, the National Gallery, incest, perhaps, & other gossip. All sitting in the drawing room, until it grew too dark to see. We have lamps almost at dinner; but not quite. I gossiped with Nessa. A new plan is on foot to supply her with Liz for a cook. Trissie is going—but never again into service. She is one of the transition cases—the servant not yet turned lady, but past servanthood. Karin & A. have gone into Brighton to see a specialist about her ear."
1918.09.03,"Pernel came on Saturday; & her coming was to have coincided precisely with the Stephens’ going; but there was a hitch here; as the fly refused to take them, & thus we enjoyed another meal with Karin. I regret to say though that either nature’s protests or our mute ones have diminished her appetite, so that she was no longer a show piece for a visitor. She announced her intention of being wheeled to Charleston on Adrian’s bicycle; which considering her shortness, breadth & great pillar like legs, produced a comic picture, & so I think Adrian judged it, for he dissuaded her from mounting till they were at the bottom of the drive.

I think the best way to sum up the impression of Pernel is to quote our simultaneous exclamation on going to bed on Saturday night “What a relief to talk to a human being!” Part of the relief, of course, is the effect of her good ears; but beyond this she is sub⁠[t]⁠le, finely graded, with fine shades of understanding & perception which are not, after all, entirely a matter of ears. I suppose if Karin were witness in her own behalf she might point to a certain faintness, remoteness, & donnishness in Pernel; she does perhaps survey life through a tinted shade, but her eyes are good ones, & she is too sensible, humorous, & indolent to have taken the shape of a professor, or indeed to believe very heartily in Newnham or education or anything but books & ideas & poetry & so on. A more unambitious person does not live; but she has not the dulness & flatness which generally exist in these self effacing unselfish old maids. I wonder what we talked about? Partly about Hope Mirrlees, whom we’ve asked to write us a story; & Jane, & Lady Strachey, & writing novels, & food. Last night, L. read Hardy’s poems aloud. The night before we discussed complexes. Then it turned out that she had been to a lecture upon potato blight. I should never be surprised to find that she knows everything about Turbines or Bees: everything that can be learnt from books that is. She lacks the ambition, perhaps the power, to handle the things themselves. Here Karin again has a plea to be considered. I suppose she has done more things than Pernel. The weather was very windy, but the mushrooms have come again. She was rather unable to see them; & I suspect she mooned rather than looked about her. She always arrives here provided with two shilling books with bright covers one to read coming, the other going. During the week end she always reads one classic & one nonsense biography, such as Lady Jeune. I suppose however that she is in her quiet dreamy way obstinately conscientious, & something of a martinet towards herself.

“Nothing would ever induce me to marry” she said, with the utmost conviction. Indeed I should fancy that her bachelor life, with many women friends, & a great many books, & lectures to prepare on French literature suit her perfectly.

This is written on the return from our great Brighton treat. Everything succeeded. L. foretold a wet day by the light on our shutters, but on opening them we found a perfect September morning. The sun is thinner but very clear, & the air sparkling, now that we are past August. The colours are being burnished on the trees too. The shadows seem lighter & paler. No one could confuse the 3rd of September with the 31st August. A perfect treat must include a visit to the 2nd hand bookshops. (I bought the life of Col. Hutchinson); sweets (we found chocolate unlimited) lunch at Mutton’s; the band on the pier; some human grotesques; tea at Booth’s; Buns at Cowley’s; a trail past shops with many temptations to buy, for the most part resisted; & a debauch at some stationer; & so home, to find the downs & this house lovelier than ever. All these things we did; & we had too a feeling of lightness because of the villages won in France. Queant & Lens are taken, as we learnt from a shop window. Can’t one see the curtain lifting, very slightly, & some promise of a world of food & so on beyond? I couldn’t help thinking that the sight of an English gentleman walking the stubble after partridges with his sons & his retriever was a foretaste of better days."
1918.09.08,"At anyrate today I am the wife of an Editor. Leonard got a letter from Bonwick to tell him that he is to get his first number out in January. He wants to know what office accommodation L. will require. It is, I think, a great triumph to have steered through the shoals of MacDonald, Trades Unions, Rowntrees, Bonwicks & all the rest. The idea is very amusing & stimulating too. I like playing with imaginary offices, & sheets of notepaper, & little boys with buttons, & myself walking up the steps to take a cup of tea, & surveying the Strand from the window. Perhaps there’ll be a shake down bed in the corner. Then Miss Matthaei in her little stall, & long galley proofs: distinguished foreign visitors; telegrams from distant capitals; general importance & glory; everything a solid improving success; yes, a very nice prospect even on its picturesque side, which I admit is the one most perceptible to me. At the same time we had a letter from Hoper offering to let us have Asheham on a yearly tenancy, in case he may ever want the house—but theres no present prospect of this. We feel fairly safe again. Ka, another letter says, is to be married at 11 tomorrow. I can’t help reading into her letter a sort of protest as to the merits of Will, & her love for him. Yet even so, I own that when I think of her I see her as a rounder warmer more complete person than she was single. I suppose I had got into the habit of seeing her faithful solitary lonely till the end of time; I like happiness too well to be very fastidious about the husband.

What has happened this last week—following upon the superb success of Brighton? For one thing the weather has been so tremendously generous, giving us after a veil of morning mist, such an endowment of sun & such clouds of alabaster firmly laid against the blue, that even people like—shall I say Melian Stawell?—must have felt jovial & random & unencumbered with high moralities. Or are they always bothering how to share the sunshine? I remember lying on the side of a hollow, waiting for L. to come & mushroom, & seeing a red hare loping up the side & thinking suddenly “This is Earth life”. I seemed to see how earthy it all was, & I myself an evolved kind of hare; as if a moon-visitor saw me. A good life it is, at such moments; but I can’t recapture the queer impression I had of its being earth life seen from the moon.

Yesterday poor Bunny came for the night, bringing 8 combs of honey, for which he charges 2/6 each. How we were robbed at Brighton! 3/- for a mixture of milk & saccarine. Poor old Bunny! He is as if caked with earth, stiff as a clod; you can almost see the docks & nettles sprouting from his mind; his sentences creak with rust. He can only lay hands on the simplest words. I suppose his vocabulary is now surpassed by Mrs Attfield & equalled by Fred. However, by dint of kindly treatment we softened him; & I must confess that for 20 hours we did very well. We wanted to know about mushrooms; & upon all funguses he is an authority; indeed he discovered one of the smallest for the first time. Then he could tell us about the agricultural labourers’ Union, which is being half secretly organised even among our Freds & Wills. He has a humanity which is not all theoretical, though he will insist upon breaking his brains over possible Labour parties. He talks to the German prisoners, who are social democrats, only fought because they would be shot for refusing, & consider the whole war a device of the artistocracy. Bunny looks forward to a democratic future. I sacrificed half my morning & sat with him hemming handkerchiefs. As an example of his uncouth absurdity which one can’t help liking he described to me a scene with Hope Mirrlees in Paris. He was furious—the creature is a most enthusiastic friend—because Lawrence’s novel was reported burnt. Hope was staying in the same hotel. He burst out to her upon the iniquity of burning books. They had never met before. She was so much of his way of thinking that he exclaimed “You darling!”—& offended her—although, as he explained, he was on the far side of the room, & used the word ‘darling’ in its other sense. I suppose he never had a rich vocabulary. Anyhow, Hope hinted that he ought to be in the army. Bunny could see nothing wrong or odd in calling a young woman “you darling!”

“Virginia, he said, intimately, I want to ask you to give me a photograph of—Alix.” He had one in mind, which I was forced to give him, to muse over, as I can fancy, by the hour, in his half sentimental simple good hearted way, while he ploughs Mr Hext’s fields with the motor plough. But I was interested by his story of the attempted rescue of Sovercar, an Indian. Bunny appeared like the manly, serious, romantic hero of a Meredith novel."
1918.09.10,"I spend the first five minutes with this hook before me trying to fish two drowned flies out of my ink pot on the tip of my pen; but I begin to see that this is one of those undertakings which are quite impossible—absolutely impossible. Not Darwin or Plato could do it with the tip of my pen. And now the flies are increasing & dissolving; today there are three. At Asheham I naturally bethink me of Darwin & Plato; but in this I am not singular. My intellectual snobbishness was chastened this morning by hearing from Janet that she reads Don Quixote & Paradise Lost, & her sister Lucretius in the evenings. I thought that no one in Sussex was reading Paradise Lost at this moment. Janet holds the characteristic view that Don Quixote is more humorous than Shakespeare. The coarseness of Shre I can see would distress her; she would deal with it intellectually. All her generation use their brains too scrupulously upon books, seeking meaning rather than letting themselves run on for pleasure, which is more or less my way, & thus naturally richest & best. Margaret is said to be not so well. I’m inclined to be hard hearted, as I expect to learn to my cost one of these days—about elderly ailments in general & Margaret’s in particular. She seems to me to live in an atmosphere where cold feet are more important than bronchitis elsewhere—part of the romance of life, as food is to Karin & reviewing books is to me. And then what an attentive solicitous echo is provided by Lilian & Janet! Margaret dominates, & they taking pleasure in unselfishness, lavish sympathy & somehow make out a different scale of health for M. than for the rest of the world—but this is a little fantastic, & rises partly from the thought that I would, if I were kind, write a long affectionate amusing letter to M. I am deterred from doing this by my prejudice against the patronage of the elderly. I want neither to be patronised, nor to patronise; & I feel that the sort of letter one writes on these occasions is an act of kindness, & so neither to be offered nor received. Inevitably the social worker approaches the non-social worker with a view to getting what they can give & very slightly disparaging the giver, who can be nothing better than a giver of amusement. Boredom is the legitimate kingdom of the philanthropic. They rule in the metropolis.

Though I am not the only person in Sussex who reads Milton, I mean to write down my impressions of Paradise Lost while I am about it. Impressions fairly well describes the sort of thing left in my mind. I have left many riddles unread. I have slipped on too easily to taste the full flavour. However I see, & agree to some extent in believing, that this full flavour is the reward of highest scholarship. I am struck by the extreme difference between this poem & any other. It lies, I think, in the sublime aloofness & impersonality of the emotions. I have never read Cowper on the Sofa, but I can imagine that the sofa is a degraded substitute for Paradise Lost. The substance of Milton is all made of wonderful, beautiful, & masterly descriptions of angels bodies, battles, flights, dwelling places. He deals in horror & immensity & squalor & sublimity, but never in the passions of the human heart. Has any great poem ever let in so little light upon ones own joys & sorrows? I get no help in judging life; I scarcely feel that Milton lived or knew men & women; except for the peevish personalities about marriage & the woman’s duties. He was the first of the masculinists; but his disparagement rises from his own ill luck, & seems even a spiteful last word in his domestic quarrels. But how smooth, strong & elaborate it all is! What poetry! I can conceive that even Shakespeare after this would seem a little troubled, personal, hot & imperfect. I can conceive that this is the essence, of which almost all other poetry is the dilution. The inexpressible fineness of the style, in which shade after shade is perceptible, would alone keep one gazing in to, long after the surface business in progress has been despatched. Deep down one catches still further combinations, rejections, felicities, & masteries. Moreover, though there is nothing like Lady Macbeth’s terror or Hamlet’s cry, no pity or sympathy or intuition, the figures are majestic; in them is summed up much of what men thought of our place in the universe, of our duty to God, our religion."
1918.09.18,"I have let the first freshness of the Webbs fade from my mirror; but let me bethink me of another metaphor which they imposed upon me, towards the end of Sunday. I was exalted above a waste of almost waveless sea, palish grey, & dented with darker shadows for the small irregularities, the little ripples which represented character & life love & genius & happiness. But “I” was not exalted; “I” was practically non-existent. This was the result of a talk with Mrs Webb. In truth though they deserve more careful handling. I wonder how I can recapture the curious discomfort of soul which Mrs Webb produces each time I see her again? In the intervals one forgets; in a second it comes over one again. There’s something absolutely unadorned & impersonal about her. She makes one feel insignificant, & a little out of key. She represses warmth or personality. She has no welcome for one’s individuality. She divines a little what one’s natural proclivities are, & she irradiates them with her bright electric torch.

It was a pouring wet day, on Saturday; not a day for geniality. Webb however has some coat to shake; she is as bare as a bone. We sat down to tea, without George Young. They eat quickly & efficiently & leave me with hunks of cake on my hands. After tea we were soon disposing of our topics, & I began to feel nervous, lest our cupboards should be bare. Then G. Young appeared, having like all Youngs, rejoiced in his battle with distance & wet. Liked the walk, he said. While he changed Mrs Webb rapidly gave me her reasons for saying that she had never met a great man, or woman either. At most, she said, they possessed remarkable single qualities, but looked at as a whole there was no greatness in them. Shakespeare she did not appreciate, because a sister, who was a foolish woman, always quoted him wrong to her as a child. Goethe might conceivably have been a great man. Then, this having been dealt with, down came L. & G. Young & they all pounced together upon some spot of interest floating far out beyond my ken. I think it was to do with the General Election & the views of the private soldiers. Young came provided with facts, but I rather think these did not stand much investigation. He is a slow, stiff, kindly man, with all Hilton’s romance, but less than Hilton’s brain; & through following his ideals he has left the diplomatic service, & is now a marine officer at Portsmouth. After dinner Mrs Webb plunged from brisk argument to unconcealed snoring. Then Sidney had his turn. I thought he spoke a little quick to conceal the snores, but you have only to ask him a question & he can go on informing you till you can hold no more. He sketched his idea of a Supernational authority, & the future of Bills of Exchange. The work of Government will be enormously increased in the future. I asked whether I should ever have a finger in the pie? “O yes; you will have some small office no doubt. My wife & I always say that a Railway Guard is the most enviable of men. He has authority, & he is responsible to a government. That should be the state of each one of us.”

And then we discussed L.’s plan of a state so contrived that each person has to do some work. Here there was a long argument upon the growing distance between men of different social grades & professions, Young affirming it, the Webbs denying it. I asked (in reporting conversations one’s own sayings stand out like lighthouses) one of my most fruitful questions; viz: how easy is it for a man to change his social grade? This brought down a whole shower bath of information, but let us say that the Webbs’ shower baths are made of soda water. They never sink one, or satiate. Webb told us how many scholarships were won in London in a given year, & also reported upon the educational system of E. Sussex, which bad though it is, is slightly better than that of W. Sussex. “I myself” he said “came too early to profit by secondary education. My parents were lower middle class shopkeepers, possessed, like so many of their kind, with a blind determination to educate their sons somehow, but without a ghost of a notion how to set about it. They hit on the plan of sending me & my brother abroad to France & Germany; & so we learnt French & German at least. I can still read them, though I seldom do.” Our talk must have dealt fully with education, for I remember that Mrs Webb woke with a start & delivered herself of a statement upon the German ‘wrong turning’, & put Young right on some point about the division of character & intellect. He was simple enough to separate them & to prefer what he was quite unable to define. She thrust him through & through with her rapier, but he persisted.

Next day, which was said to begin for the W.’s at 5.30, when they begin tea-drinking in their bedrooms, I had to withdraw in order to do battle with a very obstinate review of Wells’ ‘Joan & Peter’. My ideas were struck stiff by the tap of Mrs W.s foot, up & down the terrace, & the sound of her rather high, a rather mocking voice, discoursing to L. while she waited either for W. to come or the rain to stop. They walked on the downs, till lunch. I must now skip a great deal of conversation & let us suppose that Sidney & Beatrice & I are sitting on the road side overlooking Telscombe, smoking cigarettes, in bright sunshine, while the Silver Queen slowly patrols above Newhaven. The downs were at their best; & set Mrs W. off upon landscape beauty, & recollections of India, which she turns to when lying awake at night, relishing the recollection more than the reality. Sidney, one perceives, has no organ of sight whatever, & pretends to none. Mrs W. has a compartment devoted to nature. So briskly narrating their travels & impressions, which were without respect for British rule, we set off home. I saw them from behind, a shabby homely, dowdy couple, marching with the uncertain step of strength just beginning to fail, she clutching his arm, & looking much older than he, in her angularity. They were like pictures in French papers of English tourists, only wanting spectacles & Ba⁠[e]⁠dekers to finish them. Their clothes looked ill dusted, & their eyes peering in front of them. My few private words came, as I knew they would come, when Mrs W. detached us two together, passing Southease Church. She asked me about my novel, & I supplied her with a carefully arranged plot. I wished, so at least I said, to discover what aims drive people on, & whether these are illusory or not. She promptly shot forth: “Two aims have governed my life; one is the passion for investigation by scientific means; the other the passion for producing a certain good state of society by those investigations.” Somehow she proceeded to warn me against the dissipation of energy in emotional friendship. One should have only one great personal relationship in one’s life, she said; or at most two—marriage & parenthood. Marriage was necessary as a waste pipe for emotion, as security in old age when personal attractiveness fails, & as a help to work. We were entangled at the gates of the level crossing when she remarked, “Yes, I daresay an old family servant would do as well.” On the way up the hill she stated her position that one should wish well to all the world, but discriminate no one. According to her the differences are not great; the defects invariable; one must cultivate impersonality above all things. In old age people become of little account, she said; one speculates chiefly upon the possibility, or the impossibility of a future life. This grey view depressed me more & more; partly I suppose from the egotistical sense of my own nothingness in her field of vision. And then we wound up with a light political gossip & chapter of reminiscences, in which Mr & Mrs Webb did their parts equally. & so to bed; & to my horror, in came Mrs W. early next morning to say Goodbye, & perched in all her long impersonality on the edge of my bed, looking past my stockings drawers & po. This has taken so long to write that we are now arrived at
"
1918.09.23,"& so many things have accumulated, that I can hardly proceed to that masterly summing up of the Webbs which I intended. I intended in particular to dwell upon the half carping half humorously cynical view which steals into one’s description of the Webbs. I had meant to point out the good qualities which come from such well kept brisk intellectual habits; how open minded they showed themselves; how completely & consistently sensible. That, I think, deserves a line under it. Good sense seems to me their invariable characteristic. How sensible it was not to fuss about goodbye, or a Collins; how sensibly they approach every question whether of servants or politics, putting their minds at your service without the least ostentation or flummery. Their horizon is entirely clear, unless in the case of Mrs Webb, as the medium said, a cloud of dust surrounds them; they have no illusions; they survey the whole panorama, which is amazingly clear to them, stoically, both for the race & for themselves as individuals. Sidney is the warmer & more human of the two, & one could even commit the impropriety of liking him personally, which one can hardly do in the case of Mrs Webb. How stoically with his perpetual little smile, he remarked that they are now 60, & therefore may expect a stroke within the next 5 years; but if he could arrange things with the divine messenger, he would compound somehow to die precisely at the same moment with “my wife”.

By rights Lottie should have a whole chapter to herself at this point; but to live through those things is unpleasant enough without reviving them here. At this moment owing to what she overheard L. say to me before breakfast, I am uncertain whether we have 2 servants or not, & to tell the truth, completely indifferent, such is the relief of being without them for a fortnight. Considering their unimportance they must be compared to flies in the eye for the discomfort they can produce in spite of being so small. But let us change the subject.

I went over to Charleston last Tuesday & was shown his shells by Quentin; sat with Nessa & laid bare my sorrows, which she can more than match; & then Clive & Mary arrived in a motor car for tea—so many were their parcels & bags; & indeed Mary produced chocolates, cakes & sweets in abundance. I’m ashamed to say that that is my chief impression, but I left soon after, & they promised to spend a night here, so that I left unsaid & unasked all my ideas & questions. She was, as usual, mute as a trout—I say trout because of her spotted dress, & also because, though silent, she has the swift composure of a fish. I walked home shoving my bicycle, too badly punctured to ride.

Well then the Times began to shower books upon me, & I was reduced at one point to writing my review in the afternoon, nor can I discover any reason why one’s brains should be unavailable between 3 & 5. When the telegraph girl rode up with a telegram from Clive to put us off, owing to some disease of Mary’s, we were both immensely relieved, & I threw down my pen, as they say, & ate a large tea, & found my load of writing much lessened. When I have to review at command of a telegram, & Mr Geal has to ride off in a shower to fetch the book at Glynde, & comes & taps at the window about 10 at night to receive his shilling & hand in the parcel, I feel pressed & important & even excited a little. For a wonder, the book, Hudson, was worth reading. Then on Saturday we went to Lewes by train & bought a two handled saw, & fish, & envelopes, & then met Gertler at the station & came out here.

Whether our exclamations on parting from our guests are good evidence, I don’t know, but on this occasion we both cried “Good God, what an egoist!” We have been talking about Gertler to Gertler for some 30 hours; it is like putting a microscope to your eye. One molehill is wonderfully clear; the surrounding world ceases to exist. But he is a forcible young man; if limited, able & respectable within those limits; as hard as a cricket ball; & as tightly rounded & stuffed in at the edges. We discussed—well, it always came back to be Gertler.. “I have a very peculiar character … I am not like any other artist … My picture would not have those blank spaces … I don’t see that, because in my case I have a sense which other people don’t have … I saw in a moment what she had never dreamt of seeing…” & so on. And if you do slip a little away, he watches very jealously, from his own point of view, & somehow tricks you back again. He hoards an insatiable vanity. I suspect the truth to be that he is very anxious for the good opinion of people like ourselves, & would immensely like to be thought well of by Duncan, Vanessa & Roger. His triumphs have been too cheap so far. However this is honestly outspoken, & as I say, he has power & intelligence, & will, one sees, paint good interesting pictures, though some rupture of the brain would have to take place before he could be a painter."
1918.10.02,"No, I can’t write to Margaret Davies. I spent on her the first flush of ideas after tea—It is fatal not to write the thing one wants to write at the moment of wanting to write it. Never thwart a natural process. I had so much to say here too. First, how the weather has changed, & we are on the verge of winter. Our clocks were put back on Sunday night; simultaneously I went into thick clothes; the sun lost half its heat, the nights became bitterly cold; we began to burn wood before tea; to dine by lamplight; & to shiver without fur coats on our beds. But the impulse that was to unite & fashion & give sequence to my head full of ideas perished on the ill suited page to Margaret Davies."
1918.10.07,"I infinitely regret my generous impulse to write a letter describing the Webbs to Margaret; that evening my mind was full of ideas; & Asheham deserved some richer farewell than I am able to give it, disturbed as I am by the briskness [?] of homecoming, & a little agitated by the servant problem that I have to face tomorrow. I am inclined to dwell upon the warmth & beauty of this room. I have bought another glass jar for 2/-. These things are in the foreground. It is partly due to them & partly to the dampness of the Harmsworth press that I don’t write first & foremost of the German offer of peace. Certainly it made our hearts jump at Asheham this morning. But as the Times insists upon minimising it, not much exhilaration remains.

We came up by East Grinstead to avoid the crowd, a long journey therefore, stopping at all the dullest places in Sussex—West Hoathly among others. We lunched at Valcheras, & there looked into the lowest pit of human nature; saw flesh still unmoulded to the shape of humanity—Whether it is the act of eating & drinking that degrades, or whether people who lunch at restaurants are naturally degraded, certainly one can hardly face one’s own humanity afterwards."
1918.10.12,"The first week in London is always one of the richest; & the rich weeks always tend to pass unrecorded. I have my anniversary to celebrate also; this diary is one year old, & looking back I see how exactly one repeats one’s doings. For example this week we went to buy an overcoat for L.; last year we bought boots. Again there was the question of a party; again what I may euphemistically call an ‘argument’. Nessa was in London too; & I dined with her & Clive, only there was Duncan too, & we dined at Gordon Square. But Lord Grey’s meeting has no counterpart last year; nor could I possibly have written then, as I can now write that tomorrow morning’s paper may bring news of an armistice. Possibly the fighting will be over this time next week. Whatever we have done this week has had this extraordinary back ground of hope; a tremendously enlarged version of the feeling I can remember as a child as Christmas approached. The Northcliffe papers do all they can to insist upon the indispensability & delight of war. They magnify our victories to make our mouths water for more; they shout with joy when the Germans sink the Irish mail; but they do also show some signs of apprehension that Wilson’s terms may be accepted. L. has just come in from Staines with a paper which says, with obvious gloom, that the rumour is that Germany agrees to evacuation. She is not, of course, they add, to be allowed to make any sort of terms. Meanwhile Philip is in the thick of it, & Maurice Davies’ son has been killed.

Grey’s meeting was impressive as meetings go, which is not saying very much of course; but it does amount to saying that Grey himself struck me as a solid straightforward English Squire, curiously like Uncle Herbert magnified, in appearance, & with the kind of open air honour & sagacity which one feels to some extent in a man like Waller [Jack Hills]. He said nothing but what one has read & agreed with about a League of Nations, but he said it simply, & for a ‘great statesman’ to have sense & human feeling & no bombast does produce an odd sense of wonder & humility in me, as if human nature were worth something after all. I don’t extend my charity to Lord Harcourt however, who sat in front of us, or to Mrs Asquith & Elizabeth; they were in no way venerable or even striking; but one sees that Mrs A. has triumphed by virtue of a whipcord vitality; she is as tense as a stretched bow; as lean & wiry as a whippet; vibrating like a fiddle; but not a trace (I’m judging by my view of her profile) of any thing more profound or interesting, & as for poor pasty Elizabeth she seemed to have come straight from behind Marshall & Snelgrove’s millinery counter. There was an enormous audience, & as we left people were passing about the rumour that the Kaiser had abdicated.

I went on to my dinner at Gordon Square; thence to the Coliseum with Nessa, where we had to sit out an infinite length of Miss Clarice Mayne, after which we saw our ballet—Sche—(I can’t achieve either the spelling or the speaking of it) which isn’t one of the best, & when I saw it I remembered it better done at Covent Garden. Maynard who has the generosity & something of the manner now of an oriental prince, had hired a brougham for Nessa—an infinitely small, slow, antiquated carriage drawn by a very liverystables looking quadruped. Roger, Duncan, Maynard, Nessa & I all crammed in & padded along slowly across London to Chelsea. Somehow we passed Ottoline, brilliantly painted, as garish as a strumpet, displayed in the midst of omnibuses under an arc lamp; & she reappeared in the Sitwell’s drawing room. I had made acquaintance with the two Sitwell brothers the day before [at 46 Gordon Square], & been invited to the party. That very morning a review by me of Edith Sitwell’s poems had appeared in the Times. It’s strange how whole groups of people suddenly swim complete into one’s life. This group to which Gertler & Mary H. are attached was unknown to me a year ago. I surveyed them with considerable, almost disquieting calm. What is there to be excited about, or to quarrel over, in a party like this, I asked myself; & found myself saying the most maternal things to Gertler, who was wearing evening dress, bought from the tipsy Mr Dallas, for the first time. We stood & compared our sensations. Edith Sitwell is a very tall young woman, wearing a permanently startled expression, & curiously finished off with a high green silk headdress, concealing her hair, so that it is not known whether she has any. Otherwise, I was familiar with everyone, I think. Nina Haninet, Mary H., Jack H., Ottoline, Sheppard, Norton & so forth. I found myself discoursing to Sheppard about Sophocles. Never before have I seen him even momentarily serious.

“I think of nothing but Greek plays, he said, & people—And I’m not sure that I don’t always see people as if they were in Greek plays.” I liked him better than before; still I think he found it awkward to stand discussing Sophocles seriously; & so we parted. My complete mastery of evening parties is shown by the indifference with which I am deserted, & the composure with which I decide upon my next choice. I was a good deal impressed by this; & how calmly too, I looked at my watch, & saw it was time to leave, & went out alone, & drove to Sloane Square, not excited, not depressed, but contemplative & introspective."
1918.10.15,"I did not think I should so soon have to describe a meeting with a cabinet minister—though I admit that we seem to be drifting, without much desire on our part, into a circle where the great officials are sometime to be found. This is the doing of the [International] Review, mainly; but Herbert Fisher’s visit wasn’t due to the Review; it was very obviously due to old family affection. I was sitting down alone to tea on Sunday with my odious penny paper to read (the Germans having agreed to evacuate late on Saturday night) L. being gone to Sutton to speak about our colonies & the servants out, when the bell rang & I saw several figures against the glass. On opening the door I really couldn’t at first collect my wits; there were Olive & M. Heseltine & Herbert Fisher. The H’s. went off, & Herbert came in, as they had arranged beforehand. Was I nervous or proud, or anything but interested & anxious to pick his brains for news? I don’t think I felt a moments agitation. For one thing he has lost his lean intellectual look; his hollow cheeks are filled; his eyes with that pale frosty look which blue eyes get in age; his whole bearing very quiet, simple, & when not speaking rather saddened & subdued. The number of deaths in his house caused this perhaps; but I can’t help thinking that London life has rid him of his desire to say clever things to undergraduates all the time. Anyhow we talked without stopping & without difficulty.

“We’ve won the war today” he said, at once. “I saw Milner this morning, & he says we shall have peace by Christmas. The Germans have made up their minds they can’t fight a retreat. The General staff has faced the fact, & they’ve had what I think the considerable courage to admit it. Of course we can’t accept their present terms. Why, that would leave them still the greatest military power in Europe. They could begin again in ten years time. But it rests with the French. Lloyd George is going to Paris on Monday; but they are holding out for the evacuation of Alsace Lorraine as a guarantee. We shall probably demand the disarmament of certain regiments too. But we’ve won the war.”

He then told me how we’d won the war, which was, according to him, by taking a tremendous risk some time in July & leaving the English line held without reserves, & withdrawing the army to reinforce Foch in his blow, which was timed with French precision 10 minutes before the German attack. If it had failed there was nothing between the Germans & the Channel ports. There is now a good prospect of a complete defeat of the German army; Foch says “I have not yet had my battle”. Despite the extreme vindictiveness of our press & the French press, Herbert believed that we are going to baulk Foch of his battle, partly because the Germans will accept any terms to avoid it. “Lloyd George has told me again & again that he means to be generous to the Germans. “We want a strong Germany”, he says. The Kaiser will probably go. O I was a great admirer of the Germans in the beginning. I was educated there, & I’ve many friends there, but I’ve lost my belief in them. The proportion of brutes is greater with them than with us. They’ve been taught to be brutal. But it hasn’t paid. Each one of their crimes has turned out badly. No one can face another war. Why in 10 years they could blot out London by their aeroplanes. It cost us £1,000 to kill a German at the battle of the Somme [1916]; now it costs us £3,000. But the proportion of men who have never been hurt, or even seen anything horrible is very large. Seeley told me the other day that he’d spoken to thousands & thousands of soldiers, & they all wanted the war conditions of life to go on “without these bloody shells.” There’ll be trouble when they come back. They’ll find their old lives too dull. I’m going to educate them, its true; but that won’t begin yet—not in my time. I want to reform the Universities next, & then I shall have done. I can’t stay in Parliament without office. Very likely I shall go back to Oxford to teach.”

So we talked on, not altogether like a Mrs Humphry Ward novel. I tried to think it extraordinary but I found it difficult—extraordinary, I mean, to be in touch with one who was in the very centre of the very centre, sitting in a little room at Downing St. where, as he said, the wireless messages are racing through from all over the world, a million miles a minute; where you have constantly to settle off hand questions of enormous difficulty & importance—where the fate of armies does more or less hang upon what two or three elderly gentlemen decide. Herbert thinks there are 2 or 3 geniuses in the cabinet (L. George, Balfour, & possibly Winston Churchill—his definition being that they make everything appear different) & a number of mediocrities. His qualities I suppose are balance & foresight & culture. Importance seems to smooth away surface eccentricities; to give people an appearance of simplicity; they are very courteous; but somehow no longer spontaneous people; the taint of the family butler is on them. But this was more visible when L. came in. Alone with me H. was very friendly & quiet; & gave himself no airs of dignity."
1918.10.18,"Its quite obvious of course that for some reason perhaps not creditable to me I think H.F. worth many more words than Ka say, or Saxon, both of whom have dined here since. My theory is that for some reason the human mind is always seeking what it conceives to be the centre of things; sometimes one may call it reality, again truth, again life—I dont know what I call it; but I distinctly visualise it as a possession rather more in H.F.’s hands than in other peoples. For the moment he makes all the rest of the world’s activities appear as ramifications radiating from him. But this is roughly stated—

Old Ka anyhow is not in the knot in the middle of the web. She came alone, Will having hurt his knee; & not being there in the flesh, one didn’t trace him in the spirit. She seemed unchanged; but I think decidedly happier, a little defiant on Will’s behalf. The poor little gentle, weakly creature is stated to be wild & queer & his action in giving up his patrimony & refusing to go to Balliol is brought forward as proof. For myself I distrust young men who return to nature on the Wiltshire Downs, paint pictures of the sky only, & want more than anything to fly. I own though that I’m judging from my ancient view of him at Fitzroy Sqre. Saxon, we assume, has found complete consolation in Mrs Stagg & a new set of gold teeth. We have never seen him so sprightly, bold & communicative. He is already talking of his next visit to Bayreuth. He did not knit Barbara’s child’s drawers; & only showed a slight asperity when Nick was mentioned. But I write hurriedly, giving no account of the Albert Museum, nor of our suspension over what one of the papers calls ‘the precipice of peace’, since I must read a little about Voltaire before going up to hear a Promenade Concert at the Queen’s Hall. The truth is that nothing much more definite is yet known about peace. Wilson’s second note came out on Tuesday, in which he used the word ‘peradventure’; so far the Germans have not answered. But their Retreat goes on, & last night, beautiful, cloudless, still & moonlit, was to my thinking the first of peace, since one went to bed fairly positive that never again in all our lives need we dread the moonlight."
1918.10.23,"I went up to the concert, & heard the ghosts of lovely things, since the substance somehow escaped me; partly owing to my mood, partly to the usual vulgarity of Wood. Even so the ghosts of two Bach pieces (one for a duet of violins) were exquisitely lovely. Edith Sichel, whose entire soul is now open to me through her letters, makes me determine to write descriptions neither of pictures nor of music. She makes me consider that the gulf which we crossed between Kensington & Bloomsbury was the gulf between respectable mum⁠[m]⁠ified humbug & life crude & impertinent perhaps, but living. The breath of South Kensington lives in her pages—almost entirely, I believe, because they would not mention either copulation or w.c.’s. However this brings me to our dinner with the MacCarthy’s, when I borrowed this book. The book has a sort of fascination for me. I see the outside of that world so clearly, & take a kind of ribald pleasure in putting those figures into action—sending them slumming, to Pops [concerts], to the National Gallery, always full of high thoughts, morality, kindliness, & never seeing beyond High St. Kensington. Molly, thanks to Bloomsbury, has escaped the Ritchie touch. Her book is anyhow giving her some exquisite pleasure, & pain too. Her head, so Desmond said, shrank to the size of an apple; it is now swelling to normal again. They were both in the best spirits—extraordinary if you consider that they were in their own house, & no wine allowed. They gave us an excellent meat dinner; D. has some hopes that if Turkey makes peace he will be discharged, & will then take to wandering & writing more articles."
1918.10.24,"The degradation of steel pens is such that after doing my best to clip & file one into shape, I have to take to a Waterman [fountain pen], profoundly though I distrust them, & disbelieve in their capacity to convey the nobler & profounder thoughts. Yes, I can speak of myself with more confidence today as noble & profound; I am capable of standing for Parliament & holding office, & becoming just like Herbert Fisher perhaps. To me the vote was as surprising as to some retired cleric in the vales of Westmorland, who will see in it the death knell of liberty, I daresay, & preach a sermon to that effect next Sunday. Then the great lady at Stocks must be feeling uncomfortable, though I am malicious enough to suppose that if by some process of selection she alone could represent Belgravia in the House of Lords, the change would not seem so devastating. Imagine her neatly accoutred in black trousers (so my imagination sees her) upon the bench at the Hague Conference! Her book, the reviews say, lays emphasis upon the fact that her novels were once thought beauties.

We are just in from Kingston—today being a holiday, L. not going up to London, & printing not started. McDermott is generally invisible, & when we caught him was just going out “partly in your interests, I may say”, & threw out ominous hints as to the decline of his business, which threatens our seven pounds, so we imagine (back again to the superior fluency & cogency of steel). However, having walked across Bushy Park, & heard a stag grating his throat in a very surly manner, his doe being couchant by his side, we took tram to Kingston & there heard the paper boys shouting out about the President’s message, which we bought & devoured in the [train.] The main points are that he is keeping negotiations going, though the Times came out with a great headline “No parley” this morning. He discriminates too, between the German people & the Kaiser; he will consider an armistice with the one but only complete surrender with the other. Anyhow, the question is now laid before England & France; & so another step in the tedious business is begun.

Privately our minds are exercised about the question of going to Tidmarsh on Sunday. Lytton wired to beg us to yesterday, saying “desolation extreme”. The difficulties are the nuisance of moving; work to be done; Herbert [Woolf] & his Freda dining here on Sunday. Yes, Herbert has been accepted by a certain Miss Freda Major—who she is or what she is, except that she is reported very active, I do not know."
1918.10.26,"Here I am experimenting with the parent of all pens—the black J. the pen, as I used to think it, along with other objects, as a child, because mother used it; & therefore all other pens were varieties & eccentricities. What I have to record with it is the cheerful news that I am once more (see p. [?67] for the last occasion) in hot water—this time owing to Gertler,—Monty Shearman—Mary—Clive—Vanessa;—who exploded upon my head with reproaches for having almost brought her to disaster. My conscience is clear; but I’m coming to think that friendships maintained in this atmosphere are altogether too sharp, brittle, & painful. I have written to Charleston to this effect. If I could have letters from Mary & Clive I should feel myself rewarded. L. is down at Tidmarsh, & I write to relieve myself of the feeling which comes over me in his absence of being a besieged city.

We had a day in London yesterday—somehow the charm of those days is not quite what it was. Am I getting blasé—is the 17 Club less enthralling? We went to the Omega show, met Roger, were invited to tea at his studio, discussed the change in Duncan’s style, his father’s burial, half Church of England, half Quaker, representation, reality, & so on again, Waley coming in as we left. We dined at a very hot place in Soho, where you have perhaps a stone’s weight of food given you for 2/3. On again to the Club, where Leonard made his speech about Austria Hungary. As usual I find him not only very clear but with the right degree of passion to be interesting. The audience, as usual at the 17 Club, seemed made of curiosities whose aberrations of feature had driven them up & up the backwaters of life, where they dwell in semi obscurity, only issuing from their huts to plant arrows in the sides of the sleek town dwellers. If it weren’t so ugly, it might be picturesque. Or is it merely that the body resents much use of the brain?"
1918.10.28,"L. found Lytton with a swollen finger & 2 or 3 spots on his hand sitting over the fire, & only moving when enveloped in a silk tablecloth, & wrapping his hand also in silk handkerchiefs & complaining of the cold, & describing nights of agony when a pain like toothache seizes upon him & develops into frantic agonies only to be allayed by morphia. This has been going on for a month, & Carrington is at her wits end, very naturally. Anything like pain is abhorrent to all Stracheys, but making all allowances for the exaggerations & terrors of the poor creature, he has had a sufficient dose of horror, I imagine, & the doctor privately warns Carrington that shingles may last months. However, Lytton is probably moving in to Mary in a day or two, avoiding London, because of the influenza—(we are, by the way, in the midst of a plague unmatched since the Black Death, according to the Times, who seem to tremble lest it may seize upon Lord Northcliffe, & thus precipitate us into peace). But I am far from peace. A fortnight ago all Bloomsbury rang with my crimes; M.H. was conveyed about London in a fainting condition in taxicabs; Lytton was appealed to come to her rescue; Duncan Clive Vanessa—all were in agonies & desperations. Why no one charged me with it then, I don’t know; my private theory is that Clive inspired V.’s letter as a precaution against further indiscretions, giving strict orders that his name should not be mentioned. I soothed myself by denouncing the spy system, & now am quite unable even to feel irritated. It all comes, so I think, from the indiscreet way in which people like M.H. accept positions which they are unable to fill, & thus flinching & shying constantly, keep everybody in a state of discomfort. I announce my intention to keep clear of that set in future; & as I write this, the post brings a letter from Eliot asking to come & see us.

To my great surprise a voice upon the telephone developed into the voice of Lady Mary Murray; asking us to lunch yesterday. We changed lunch to tea & went off to More’s Gardens, a block of flats on the Embankment, where after ringing for some time, a gigantic knock was answered by Lady Mary in person. L. was half inclined to think her an untidy but cordial housemaid. The Fisher Williams’ were there. A tea party is the least natural of situations, & produces the utmost amount of discomfort I think. Then the F.W.’s possessed only the brain of one moderate sized rabbit between them. Still it was the respectability that weighed me down, not the absence of intellect. There are certain dun coloured misty days in autumn which remind me of the Murray’s atmosphere. The cleanliness of Gilbert was remarkable; a great nurse must rub him smooth with pumice stone every morning; he is so discreet, so sensitive, so low in tone & immaculate in taste that you hardly understand how he has the boldness to beget children. She is a wispy elderly lady, highly nervous, a little off hand & much of an aristocrat in her dashing method, kindly, fussy, refined too—O yes, they are all refined. I sat & talked to Gilbert first about our love of sweets, then about the Greek love of wine, then about his standing with the Government. He has, he says, refused many honours, but was reprimanded for sending a review of a book on Job to America. Maliciously enough, I felt that his simplicity was maintained in the face of years of worship & adulation, & that the proper thing to say is “How wonderfully simple dear Gilbert Murray is!” But his niceness was unmeasured. The Toynbees came in. I had a long rigmarole with Arnold about his office & his learning & so forth; I think I frighten him; or perhaps I’m not used to the Oxford manner. Its suavity & politeness are strange to me. He is so shortsighted that he has a painful look of pinkness round the eyes, as if he were a grammar school boy exalted by the most assiduous industry to positions above his station. I’m always surprised to find how well meaning & even outspoken he is in spite of this.

Home to find Freda Major marooned at the station, so that L. had to fetch her. Herbert came after a field day; he’d been out since 6. & took F. home, & caught the last train to Staines. Freda is merely a toy dog enveloped in human flesh, but retaining the pretty, plaintive, rather peevish ways of her canine existence. She has stimulated Herbert to talk with greater fluency & enthusiasm than usual about the policeman strike & Ford’s motor cars."
1918.10.30,"Just in from a walk in the Park on this incredibly lovely autumn day. Various houses have orange berries growing upon them; the beech trees are so bright that everything looks pale after you have looked at them. (How I dislike writing directly after reading Mrs H. Ward!—she is as great a menace to health of mind as influenza to the body.) We talked of peace: how the sausage balloons will be hauled down, & gold coins dribble in; & how people will soon forget all about the war, & the fruits of our victory will grow as dusty as ornaments under glass cases in lodging house drawing rooms. How often will the good people of Richmond rejoice to think that liberty has been won for the good people of Potsdam? I can believe though that we shall be more arrogant about our own virtues. The Times still talks of the possibility of another season, in order to carry the war into Germany, & there imprint a respect for liberty in the German peasants. I think the distance of the average person from feelings of this sort is the only safeguard & assurance that we shall settle down again neither better nor worse.

We had a day in London yesterday; ending for me in talks with Ka & James at the Club, which now renews its life apparently. Ka has ceased to be a bureaucrat owing to Will’s illness; shed power as a chestnut its husk; & remains untouched within. James just back from Cornwall, where he had the influenza. Alix back too; without having the influenza & ready, I suppose to begin her autumn campaign, which Oliver bets that she will win. I here note that I bought my new battery on Tues. Oct. 29th; so far of extreme brilliance."
1918.11.03,"On Friday night I went up to dine with the Arnold Forsters, partly I own, to avoid Mr Seymour Cox’s lecture upon the Secret Treaties, since I thought I knew already what Mr Seymour Cocks would say. Ka & Will live just past the Spectator office in the little semicircle of houses standing off the road, but tolerably noisy nevertheless. Here he lived before his marriage. He looked unusually small, drawn & pallid, like a face seen under a gas lamp, owing to his disease; & no longer young. He reminds me rather of one of those old ladies, who have yellow hair & very pink cheeks, but you can count their years in the way the flesh is drawn tight across the bone, & crinkled with very delicate fine lines. His person & manners are against him. He makes an impression of being very sharp, rather fretful, & acid. I think all this is largely due to his peevish voice, & little angular body, which he jerks about when he gets excited, & very little makes him emphatic. Nor did I like the pale acid decorations of the room—the lavender walls, & the one white rose drooping against them; nor did I like his niggled & emotional picture of the downs. There seemed a lack of warmth, depth, & substance. Perhaps none of this very much matters. His principles are those of the modern husband—freedom & independence for the wife—equal pleasures. Principles matter too. Ka will be happy with him. We talked very briskly. I dont think I should like his taste in books; I don’t like his slang; or his admirations; but I liked his excitement over the war office gazette. I suspect he has an able excitable rather febrile mind, which, on principle, has taken to painting pictures; I could wager my own head full of brains that he’ll never paint a good one.

On Saturday, we had one of our Hampstead afternoons, L. going to Margaret, I to Janet. I’ve done the same thing so often. I’ve found her in that green distempered room, with the ugly pictures. How well I know the benevolent look of the late Mr Case as a young man, drawn upon yellow paper & very slightly tinted on the cheeks, larger than life, framed in gold, by the late Mr Richmond. I know the photographs of young soldiers, & the silhouettes, & Janet’s books, which never seem to be read, & the greek dictionary with the piece of paper sticking out of it. Then theres Diana who takes up a lot of attention; but is now a reformed character. Emphie vagulates in & out of the room. Tea is prepared. I am pressed to eat more of everything. Questioned about butter & coal. Yesterday Emphie had a new kind of methylated spirits to show me, which you can only get in Highgate. Mr Marshall rather varied the proceedings—a well kept middle aged gentleman of Hampstead who proclaimed his wish to rule the world; & his fear lest America should rule it instead. Here was a Times leading article in the flesh. But he was also a chatty old gossip; & he & Emphie had noticed so many houses unlit, newcomers who were almost unknown, trees that wanted lopping, motor cars waiting for Mr Galsworthy, preparations for opening the Y.M.C.A., that it was like Cranford, to listen. And then they went & Janet talked to me about literature, & I fell into a passing gloom. She says that a great many novels are written, & it seems fairly evident that none are “immortal”. I suppose I referred this to my own novels; indeed, she urged me to write a biography for Basil Williams. But I fancy that what depressed me was not only the personal question, but the smell of musty morality. None of us came up to the scratch—not Lytton or Forster or anyone; but I felt beyond this fairly safe criticism the depressing effect of talking to some one who seems to want all literature to go into the pulpit; who makes it all infinitely worthy & safe & respectable. I was led into trying to define my own particular search—not after morality, or beauty or reality—no; but after literature itself; & this made Janet a little anxious & insistent, as if, conceivably, she might have missed something. Where did I find it? How did I explain it? We agreed upon a certain passage in Sophocles; but as she capped this with one in Lear, I think we were talking of different things. And she pressed me to tell her what I meant; & of course I came nowhere near it, & at length she said that she thought she was beginning to find what I meant—after all these years of reading Greek! Yes, I was depressed at her age, at something unstable about her; but I was also depressed at the implied criticism of The Voyage Out, & at the hint that I had better turn to something other than fiction. Now this seems to me foolish, & I wish I could make up a cure for it, to be taken after such encounters, which are bound to happen every month of one’s life. Its the curse of a writers life to want praise so much, & be so cast down by blame, or indifference. The only sensible course is to remember that writing is after all what one does best; that any other work would seem to me a waste of life; that on the whole I get infinite pleasure from it; that I make one hundred pounds a year; & that some people like what I write. But Janet would only admit that love counted, & said that her friends had succeeded only in “coming off” in life, not in art."
1918.11.04,"Since I’m back from the Club & waiting for L. (who has gone to see Mr Hawkins of the Temple [unidentified]) I had better assuage my fretfulness with pen & ink. I have a pen of malachite vulcanite(?) which perhaps serves the purpose of a babies coral. I’ve had no letter from Charleston which makes me feel rather sent to Coventry, though I suppose communications are going on between Clive & Mary; & then I can’t help fancying that Janet’s chill falling upon the last pages of my novel still depresses me. The depression however now takes the wholesome form of feeling perfectly certain that nothing I can do matters, so that one is both content & irresponsible—I’m not sure that this isn’t a happier state than the exalted state of the newly praised. At least one has nothing to fear, & the sheer pleasure of writing seems singularly unalloyed. It proves itself so genuine that no amount of Hampstead cold water can impair it. Praise? fame? Janet’s good opinion? How beside the mark they all are!

I keep thinking of different ways to manage my scenes; conceiving endless possibilities; seeing life, as I walk about the streets, an immense opaque block of material to be conveyed by me into its equivalent of language. (Lottie’s fire has to be nursed like a dying kitten—its my fire now, her’s being dead of course, & I’ve taken 25 minutes to get a trickle of flame between the coals.) In the intervals I’ve been thinking a good deal about this melancholy state of impending age. From the way Janet took certain remarks of mine about 60 as an age limit (for the Webbs) I felt that she took age to be a shameful disease that one shrank from hearing named. At anyrate, it is obvious that she must think about it privately, not facing it, turning away from it. And then it seems as if she were now always playing for safety. She has a kind of personal resentment against anyone, like Lytton for example, who laughs at what she holds sacred; she falls into the insidious trap of believing that any departure from the great is ephemeral & impertinent; & she argues this with personal feeling as if her own reputation depended on theirs. And all the time she’s so anxious to be in the front, to share what the young feel. But if I represent the young, my feelings tend to develop on such different lines that I can only wave my hand over leagues of Sea.

To Souhami’s; Mudies & the Club."
1918.11.09,"Lord Mayor’s day among other things, & one of the two last of war, I suppose. It’s just possible that Lottie may bring us news that the armistice is signed within an hour. People buy papers at a great rate; but except for an occasional buzz round a newspaper boy & a number of shop girls provided with The Evening News in the train one feels nothing different in the atmosphere. The general state perhaps is one of dazed surfeit; here we’ve had one great relief after another; you hear the paper boys calling out that Turkey has surrendered, or Austria given up, & the mind doesn’t do very much with it; was the whole thing too remote & meaningless to come home to one, either in action or in ceasing to act? Katherine Murry, whom I saw on Wednesday, inclines to think that most people have grasped neither war nor peace. Two or three weeks ago I heard a citizen holding forth to a lady in the train, who asked him whether he thought there would be peace.

“I hope not…. We’re giving them everything they want & getting nothing.” Since then it is difficult to see how the most bloodthirsty citizens can squeeze anything more out of Germany. The Kaiser still wears a phantom kind of crown. Otherwise there is revolution, & a kind of partial awakenment, one fancies, on the part of the people to the unreality of the whole affair. Suppose we wake up too?

We began to set up Kew Gardens this week—Thursday was the first day of it, I think. MacDermott has surrendered his £7: after a little ineffective shuffling. On Wednesday I went up to Hampstead; found the tall ugly villa looking over the valley where the Murrys live. Katherine was up, but husky & feeble, crawling about the room like an old woman. How far she is ill, one cant say. She impresses one a little unfavourably at first—then more favourably. I think she has a kind of childlikeness somewhere which has been much disfigured, but still exists. Illness, she said, breaks down one’s privacy so that one can’t write—The long story she has written breathes nothing but hate. Murry & the Monster [LM] watch & wait on her, till she hates them both; she trusts no one; she finds no ‘reality’."
1918.11.11,"Twentyfive minutes ago the guns went off, announcing peace. A siren hooted on the river. They are hooting still. A few people ran to look out of windows. The rooks wheeled round, & were for a moment, the symbolic look of creatures performing some ceremony, partly of thanksgiving, partly of valediction over the grave. A very cloudy still day, the smoke toppling over heavily towards the east; & that too wearing for a moment a look of something floating, waving, drooping. We looked out of the window; saw the housepainter give one look at the sky & go on with his job; the old man toddling along the street carrying a bag out [of] which a large loaf protruded, closely followed by his mongrel dog. So far neither bells nor flags, but the wailing of sirens & intermittent guns."
1918.11.12,"We should have done well, I think, to be satisfied with the aspect of peace; how the rooks flew slowly in circles, & the smoke drooped; but I had to go to Harrison, & I think we were both conscious of a restlessness which made it seem natural to be going up to London. Disillusionment began after 10 minutes in the train. A fat slovenly woman in black velvet & feathers with the bad teeth of the poor insisted upon shaking hands with two soldiers; “Its thanks to you boys &c &c”. She was half drunk already, & soon produced a large bottle of beer which she made them drink of; & then she kissed them, & the last we saw of her was as she ran alongside the train waving her hand to the two stolid soldiers. But she & her like possessed London, & alone celebrated peace in their sordid way, staggering up the muddy pavements in the rain, decked with flags themselves, & voluble at sight of other people’s flags. The Heavens disapproved & did their utmost to extinguish, but only succeeded in making feathers flop & flags languish. Taxicabs were crowded with whole families, grandmothers & babies, showing off; & yet there was no centre, no form for all this wandering emotion to take. The crowds had nowhere to go, nothing to do; they were in the state of children with too long a holiday. Perhaps the respectable suppressed what joy they felt; there seemed to be no mean between tipsy ribaldry & rather sour disapproval. Besides the discomfort tried every one’s temper. It took us from 4 to 6 to get home; standing in queues, every one wet, many shops shut, no light yet procurable, & in everyone’s mind the same restlessness & inability to settle down, & yet discontent with whatever it was possible to do."
1918.11.15,"I’ve no money to buy another book; besides by waiting the paper question may once more take its place in the scale of my pleasures; good books, cheap books, books that make one wish to finish them in order to have the pleasure of buying another may be built up against the wall in stationers shops. Peace is rapidly dissolving into the light of common day. You can go to London without meeting more than two drunk soldiers; only an occasional crowd blocks the street. In a day or two it will be impossible for a private to threaten to knock out the brains of an officer, as I saw done the other day in Shaftesbury Avenue. But mentally the change is marked too. Instead of feeling all day & going home through dark streets that the whole people, willing or not, were concentrated on a single point, one feels now that the whole bunch has burst asunder & flown off with the utmost vigour in different directions. We are once more a nation of individuals. Some people care for football; others for racing; others for dancing; others for—oh, well, they’re all running about very gaily, getting out of their uniforms & taking up their private affairs again. Coming home from the Club tonight I thought for a moment that it must still be sunset, owing to the sharp bright lights in Piccadilly Circus. The streets are crowded with people quite at their ease; & the shops blazoning unshaded lights. Yet its depressing too. We have stretched our minds to consider something universal at any rate; we contract them at once to the squabbles of Lloyd George, & a General Election. The papers are unreadable. One’s sense of perspective is so changed that one cannot see at first what meaning all this gossip of parties can possibly have; one can’t be interested. Other people have more right to be sluggish than I have. One predicts a year or two of laxity save on the part of the professionals. They will have things their own way. Masses [?] will play football & cricket & take shooting in the country. The first effect of peace on our circle is to set Desmond loose, & to bring Gerald Shove up to London saying that he must find a way of making £500 a year. Before long the crowd of out of work intellectuals looking for places will be considerable. Desmond is doing what he knows how to do supremely well—going later & later to the office every day & taking longer for lunch, & sometimes not going back again. This he proposes to continue for a fortnight; then to fold up his blue & gold coat for ever—unless by cutting off the brass buttons he can make it do for an ordinary coat. His spirits are very high, though depressed occasionally by the question of earning a living. It came out that he means to suggest himself for Solomon Eagle’s place on the New Statesman; for the Eagle is flying higher. “I know so many people who write well” he said; & if that were all, he would make a perfect editor. After tea he told us the last section of the Ireniad. I suppose it would fill a book, from start to finish. It ended, characteristically, with his promising to go to lunch—& waiting eleven years before he saw her again. The story brought her back very plainly; perhaps his conclusion was right—one ought to pity any woman who is engaged to a young Cambridge man who has never been in love before—a young Cambridge man, I should add, who has read & has by heart all the novels of Henry James.

I was interrupted somewhere on this page by the arrival of Mr Eliot. Mr Eliot is well expressed by his name—a polished, cultivated, elaborate young American, talking so slow, that each word seems to have special finish allotted it. But beneath the surface, it is fairly evident that he is very intellectual, intolerant, with strong views of his own, & a poetic creed. I’m sorry to say that this sets up Ezra Pound & Wyndham Lewis as great poets, or in the current phrase “very interesting” writers. He admires Mr Joyce immensely. He produced 3 or 4 poems for us to look at—the fruit of two years, since he works all day in a Bank, & in his reasonable way thinks regular work good for people of nervous constitutions. I became more or less conscious of a very intricate & highly organised framework of poetic belief; owing to his caution, & his excessive care in the use of language we did not discover much about it. I think he believes in “living phrases” & their difference from dead ones; in writing with extreme care, in observing all syntax & grammar; & so making this new poetry flower on the stem of the oldest.

As an illustration of Eliot’s views I may add what Desmond has just (Thursday 21st Nov.) told me; D. asked him how on earth he came to add that remark at the end of a poem on his Aunt & the Boston Evening Transcript that phrase about an infinitely long street, & “I like La Rochefoucauld saying good bye” (or words to that effect). Eliot replied that they were a recollection of Dante’s Purgatorio!"
1918.11.21,"I am overwhelmed with things that I ought to have written about; peace dropped like a great stone into my pool, & the eddies are still rippling out to the further bank. Has Nelly Cecil sunk beyond recall? & that concert at Shelley House, presided over, so appropriately by Bruce Richmond? For the sake of the good report of my diary let me record the fact that Nelly Cecil met the Kaiser at Hatfield: & said he appeared a small man, in a grey suit, & “his people were afraid of him—They were afraid to tell him if his motor car was late…. He was romantic—very romantic.”

Too much space would be needed for an accurate description of Shelley House: briefly speaking it is a luxurious sham in imitation of the 18th century; but as people like the St John Hornbys never put all their eggs in one basket, the Italian renaissance is represented too; &, I should guess, Arthur Hughes shows that they patronise English art; but mainly they put their faith in George the Third. How much the annual income of the audience amounted to, I should not like to guess; they wore a substantial part of it on their backs: the furs were richly dark; the stuffs of the best black. And then the lovely music offered up before this congregation—among whom, as they say, I noticed Mrs Rathbone, Pearsall Smith, Hervey Vaughan Williams, & Mrs Muir Mackenzie.

However peace came & dissipated all that; & now where are we? According to Roger, on the brink of revolution; this is strictly speaking, according to Ray, & Ray, who is standing for Parliament as a Coalition candidate, says that if ever she were tempted to hoard food, now would be the time. The Lower classes are bitter, impatient, powerful, & of course, lacking in reason. For example they demand houses with 10 rooms at Guildford; & they have a prophet, Ditcher by name, who knows the truth; he knows what the brain is made of; & he has no use for the “middle class idealism” which cherishes doubts about some matters, & preaches liberty, toleration, & other humbug; for Ditcher knows the truth. These are a few facts that I gathered from Roger over a dish of tripe & leeks. I cheered him a little by reminding him of the existence of football & of King George. How they crowd—my memories of the past week! Mention of King George recalls Harry Stephen who sat like a frog with his legs akimbo, opening & shutting his large knife, & asserting with an egoism proper to all Stephens, that he knew how to behave himself, & how other people ought to behave, which science he taught, with success according to him, upon the Bench at Calcutta. He has need of the Royal Family; he wants someone descended from Egbert upon the throne; not a schoolmaster, like Wilson. The impenetrable wall of the middle class conservative was never more stolid; dynamite may smash it to powder; but—it is impervious to reason, or imagination or humanity; an educated version of the prophet Ditcher.

Poor James Strachey was soft as moss, lethargic as an earthworm. James, billed at the 17 Club to lecture on “Onanism”, proposes to earn his living as an exponent of Freud in Harley Street. For one thing, you can dispense with a degree.

But the real news of the past week is of a confidential nature. [Gilbert] Murray has asked L. to be his secretary if, as is possible, he is chosen to represent England on the League of Nations Committee at the Peace Conference. This would mean a visit to Paris. More than this need not be said; but it is an important possibility. Coming after it, the news that I today wrote the last words of my novel reads a little flat. Five hundred & thirty eight pages!
"
1918.11.30,"I see I’ve been rather slack, & I cant remember now exactly what’s made me slack. Certainly not the General Election. I’ve reduced my reading of newspapers, though the D⁠[aily]. N⁠[ews]. has an extra sheet. They somehow keep it up. Mrs Dacre Fox bellows in the High St. McDermott demands a government which will make the Germans pay. He prints poster after poster in red ink. I’ve a new niece, Judith, not welcomed, but made the best of; & Barbara has a Judith too; & Saxon dined here, talking of death without enthusiasm. He knew for certain that he would die on a certain day last summer & then—didn’t.

One night we went to the Russian dancers; & it was incongruous enough to see what they offered the tolerant good tempered public who had been bellowing like bulls over the efforts of a man to nail a carpet down. They were tolerant, but, as I fancied, a little bit contemptuous of all this posing & springing against a flat blue wall. What a queer fate it is—always to be the spectator of the public, never part of it. This is part of the reason why I go weekly to see K.M. up at Hampstead, for there at any rate we make a public of two. On Thursday Murry came in, & we had an awkward, interesting talk; too self conscious to be enkindling. I think something or other is a little inharmonious in both of them;—in my arrogance, I suppose I feel them both too much of the underworld, with all sorts of nostrums of their own; & all this talk about being artists. I dont express what I mean. Perhaps all I mean is that they seem suspicious—Beneath the surface I expect that they are both very anxious for appreciation, not at all sure of themselves, & Murry wrings his brains dry, & becomes more & [more] hopeless of finding anything to believe in. I dont like married couples where the husband admires the wife’s work immensely.

Arthur Ponsonby came up & spoke to us at the Club the other day. He is standing somewhere, & wants to get in, if only to prove that his side has a good case; he said he didn’t much care to be in Parliament itself. A weak, moderately intelligent, kindly man, permanently puzzled, & worried too, by the strange order of the world. Living in a social class different from the one he was born into may account for this. Then we had Dr Leys to lunch on Wednesday (27th, I put in by way of mark). He has spent 17 years in East Africa, & being a very sterling direct Scotchman has a terrible tale to tell about the natives. How they concentrate, how bare of superfluity they are, these professional intellectual men!

Printing off on our little machine began today, & now I must give my very best attention to Murry’s manuscript, A Fable for Critics, which I brought home in my bag, with a view to printing.
"
1918.12.03,"(What odd stray of knowledge makes me think that this is Carlyle’s birthday? Perhaps because I’m reading about Froude;—I go on to wonder whether any one else is thinking of Carlyle’s birthday, & if so whether it gives him any pleasure; & again of the curious superstition, haunting literary people, of the value of being remembered by posterity—but I had better rein myself in).

I have to read for a second time Murry’s poem, which I found hard to read; from reasons the opposite of those that make Eliot hard to read: Murry has a plethora of words; his poem is intricate & involved & as thick as a briar hedge; he does his thinking aloud; not making you fetch it from the depths of silence as Eliot does. We’ve been walking by the river, & indeed sitting beside it, so hot it is, bland, milky, & without thrill in the air. The gulls were letting themselves be carried down stream, for a diversion I suppose; little companies of three & four gliding down, & then one dives & reappears. We discussed the origin of my present fit of melancholy, & I was divinely reassured by L. so that here I sit comfortable & secure; once more established in that degree of belief which makes life possible. But I leave out the analysis, which I have gone into sufficiently. I fancy all people have these spiritual tides in them—Heaven knows why. Altogether the more one thinks of it the stranger one’s own organisation appears.

On Sunday, that is the 1st December we had a dinner party. Six people make a dinner party. They destroy private conversation. You have to be festive. We had Nick, Carrington, Mrs Manus & Sanger: & I think it was a successful party. We were sufficiently springy & spontaneous I think. Charlie made his little jokes. Nick was nearly silent, but appreciative. I foresee a testy middle age for Nick. Mrs Manus enjoyed her dinner. Carrington has more merit than most of the young. We had chairs down and abolished the sofa. I can’t for the life of me remember what we talked about, save that Charlie emphatically despised both Herbert Fisher & Gilbert Murray. He doesn’t like to be asked to meet people because they’re interesting he said. I said no, you only like failures. On Monday I went first to Harrison’s with L. then walked across Regent’s Park & had tea with Barbara. Regent’s Park at 4.30 on a December afternoon is a dreary place. So many purple leaves seem to be flattened on the path. Then the park keepers begin whistling, & I remember being afraid of being shut in, as a child. Then the mist rolls up over that vast open space. On one side of you the commoner animals in the zoo grunt & growl—chiefly pigs now, for war purposes I suppose. This did not produce a cheerful frame of mind in which to visit an invalid; & to my horror I found that she shares a room with another, a widow, whose husband was killed; & there poor woman, she sat, pretending to read a book & not to look my way, while Barbara & I gossiped, without much spirit. B. would have preferred a son; sons, she says, are more troublesome, nervous, naughty, from birth; I suppose this is the natural feeling, though not a very desirable one; assertiveness seems to her interesting. Her own baby, with Nick’s nose, slept in a cradle; grumbling a little, but very good she said. The future seemed to oppress her."
1918.12.07,"For some reason, not connected with my virtues I think, I get 2 or even 3 books weekly from the Times, & thus breast one short choppy wave after another. It fills up the time while Night & Day lies dormant; it gives me distinct pleasure I own to formulate rapid views of Henry James & Mr Hergesheimer; chiefly because I slip in some ancient crank of mine. But this sort of writing is always done against time; however much time I may have. For example here I have spent the week (but I was interrupted 2 days, & one cut short by a lunch with Roger) over Hakluyt: who turns out on mature inspection to justify over & over again my youthful discrimination. I write & write; I am rung up & told to stop writing; review must be had on Friday; I typewrite till the messenger from the Times appears; I correct the pages in my bedroom with him sitting over the fire here.

“A Christmas number not at all to Mr Richmond’s taste, he said. Very unlike the supplement style.”

“Gift books, I suppose?” I suggested.

“O no, Mrs Woolf, its for the advertisers.”

But to retrace. On Thursday I lunched with Roger in order to hear the following story.

Mrs McColl to Mr Cox of the London Library:

“Have you The Voyage Out by Virginia Woolf?”

“Virginia Woolf? Let me see; she was a Miss Stephen, daughter of Sir Leslie. Her sister is Mrs Clive Bell I think. Ah, strange to see what’s become of those two girls. Brought up in such a nice home too. But then, they were never baptised..”

Roger & I get on very well now; more genuine & free than we were, under the shadow of Gordon Square. We agree on many points; & he, at least, perceives the isolation of our little group in the large hostile world of MacColls & Duckworths. Then we discuss prose; & as usual some book is had out, & I have to read a passage over his shoulder. Theories are fabricated. Pictures stood on chairs. Here I become rather random & desperate. Wolfe brings in a picture—The question is about a slice of green on the midmost apple. Does it interpose with the violet on the edge of the potato? “Cut it out: see the way the colours show up over there:—well try varnish then.” “I think its the best thing I’ve done yet.” “O yes, there’s more life in it—its very strong, Wolfe, very strong.”

At last, inevitably late, I go on to the 17 Club, where Mrs Manus & L. sit in the upper room, correcting proofs, but Couch [? printer] has only sent a batch. Anyhow, I was too late to help; but not to pour out tea for Miss Matthaie. Why should a woman of her sense apologise all her life long because she is an unattractive woman? She looks up sidelong, like a child who has done wrong. And yet she has more in her head than all the cropheads put together. Alix I found intoning pompously downstairs, with a perverted likeness to a colonel of the upper classes holding forth upon the iniquity of Bolshevism. Her theme is the iniquity of colonels; the method seems much the same; even the voice.

Friday, as I say was spent writing by me; by Leonard in having lunch with Will A.F. & correcting more proofs. No sooner had I done a little type setting, & ruled off the hour & a half before dinner in which to read my distinguished American novelist [Hergesheimer] recommended by Mr Galsworthy, than Lottie admitted Sydney Waterlow. My only hope for passing the time was some sort of introspective confidence on his part; but no such luck. He is prosperous, complacent, self assured even to the extent of confronting the disapproval of Gordon Square unabashed. He is now on the round of his friends, not, he was careful to explain in order to test us, but to enjoy our society. Mary Sheepshanks had been summoned to dine with us in order to discuss the Review, & MacDonald’s treachery. Paler, perhaps thinner, fading into middle age imperceptibly, with the same flavour of bitterness against a world—a world of upper class women, it is at the present moment, who ask for an indemnity. Yet, compared with the greater variety of my acquaintance, she comes out abler, better informed, more rational than I remembered her in the days of Fitzroy Square. But still she accepts her “nice evening” as the grudging poor accept a charity which is rather less than they deserve."
1918.12.10,"Sunday was memorable to me for another visit to Shelley House—where I actually shook hands with Miss Sands, Katie, & Elena Rathbone. All expressed great surprise at seeing me, as if I were a strange bird joining a flock of the same species. I felt strange enough; but oddly familiar with their ways after the first. Elena was almost like an old friend—a very old friend who persists, remembering what went on before I took my dive & she hers. She pressed me, almost affectionately, to come & see them. I shall do it with misgivings. Suppose we have absolutely nothing to say? All her charming frank caressing manner may vanish. And then there is the eternal, & insoluble question of clothes. Katie rather ensanguined & flesh covered, but with a great dignity & amplitude of feature, sitting very up right, eyes half closed, in the front of the room, listening to Ravel & Schumann, which she said she admired equally.

On Monday I paid what has now become my weekly visit to Katherine. Murry was there; which makes it a little stiff, though I like them both, & her better as a wife. He scarcely speaks; makes one feel that most speaking is useless; but as he has a brain of his own I don’t mind this. Besides it is more shyness than purpose. I told such stories as I could think of; Murry then explained that he had a confession to make. It only amounted to the fact that he has bought his brother a hand press, upon which some short poems of his are to be printed, beautifully, like Kelmscott books. Arthur is learning at a Polytechnic, & wishes to do ‘art’ printing. I rather suspect Arthur’s views of art. But anyhow we are to do what we like with Murry’s long poem. At present to give it McDermott seems the most feasible plan, when the great red posters are all issued, which have begun to paper Richmond during the past few days. “Payment, Punishment…” & some other P. is the policy they advocate. We shall probably vote for no one. A wet day; but we went out having “practically” finished Kew Gardens; I mean it is all ready to print save a few lines. Light in my study gives out about 3.30. Now I shall try to do a few lines of Eliot before we go away. There is one of the usual kitchen intrigues to have Liz & children to Asheham for Christmas. Nelly doesnt like to ask me; Lottie makes up a rigmarole about saving us expense & this being the last time that she will be able to leave home. How terrible it is to be in this position to other grown people!"
1918.12.16,"Back from a week end with Roger. Lips, therefore, rather sore with talk, though his range is so wide, & we both have such a number of things to say that I, certainly, was neither bored nor satiated. Pamela was there, very rounded, supple, with a likeness to some naked wood creature in an Italian picture; she has the yellow brown complexion too. I suspect that children take the shape of their parents the other way about; a vivacious sociable enthusiastic father produces a quiet, unselfish, rather passive daughter. She is only sixteen, but mature in manner, as the result of living with grown up people. It was polling day on Saturday in Guildford, as in other parts of the world, & Roger very gloomy about the future of the world. No doubt he will soon forget about politics. The war is already almost forgotten. All Sunday, in spite of rain & fog he painted till the sky was black, having been grey through the time of daylight. I feel little hope about his pictures, but had to counterfeit an opinion as to the effect produced on the solidity of a bowl by a mornings work on it. He said that he grudged every hour of daylight spent not painting, since age draws near, & he must say what he wants to say before he dies. Age he proposes to spend alone, working all day long. At last he seems to do what he has always tried to do. We had some melancholy revelations about the treachery of certain friends towards the Omega. Roger’s great point is that though superficially unbalanced & exaggerated his sense of balance is always right in the end; he is always magnanimous & forgiving, however much weight he may lay upon imaginary or semi-imaginary grievances. The Omega case is that his artists accept commissions independently of the Omega. For that & other reasons the poor shop has been a source of unmitigated disillusion to him—a weariness & grievance. People hate art & him for loving it is now a frequent burden of his talk. Nor did I show myself one of the elect, with regard to painting at least. We visited the National Gallery together this morning; I thought a Rembrandt “very fine” which to him was mere melodrama. A little El Greco conveyed little until he illumined it; showed how it held more real colour than any other picture there. Then the Ingres was repulsive to me; & to him one of the most marvellous of designs. I always feel, too, that to like the wrong thing, or fail in sufficiently liking the right jars on him, like false notes, or sentimentality in writing."
1918.12.17,"This I cannot help fearing will be my last opportunity for writing before I go to Asheham on Friday, though I shall continue there, God being willing, in some form of new book. Tomorrow I go to K.M. Thursday I have tea with the Richmonds, & perhaps dine at the Club; so Friday is reached without any interval between tea & dinner; & even today I am stealing what belongs to Sophocles, before Mrs Hamilton arrives at 7 to address the Guild. Suppose I buy a block, with detachable leaves, I think I shall snare a greater number of loose thoughts. No doubt this is pure fancy, but then so much of one’s mental affairs are controlled by fancy. Nessa has asked us to have the children for a fortnight when the new baby is born. This is now imminent, & she fixes the 28th for the exact day. The servants go to Guildford for a week, in order that we may be free from Liz & her offspring. We shall have one week entirely alone, at Asheham, the greatest & most unmixed pleasure this world affords; enhanced very much in my mind by the absence of servants, so that often we are alone in the house. I am going to read through my novel & determine what to do with it. L.’s book is almost done; February will see it finished most likely. We have printed off the text of Kew Gardens, & got an estimate from McDermott for printing Murry’s poem. He asks £4.10. which to us seems little, for 200 copies of a 24 page book. We supply the paper, & the cover. Possibilities are opened up I think.

Weather has been so warm that I dont think I’ve had a fire in my study more than 3 or 4 times, & that only when we were printing in the afternoon. Influenza seems to be over, though Lottie had an attack lasting an hour or two on Saturday. Iced cakes are possible, but so far no more than that. As for public news, the war already seems an unimportant incident; one of our political dodges, & at this moment the news boys are shouting that Russia prepares for war. It is difficult to see how even a jingo can now believe in any good from war, or any ideal, or anything, one feels tempted to add undertaken by bodies of human beings in concert. It is said that Labour did well, & the Coalition only moderately, at the polls. Ray is said to have a good chance;—we voted on Saturday, but L. overcome with panic, very likely voted for Mrs Dacre Fox."
1919.01.20,"I mean to copy this out when I can buy a book, so I omit the flourishes proper to the new year. It is not money this time that I lack, but the capacity, after a fortnight in bed, to make the journey to Fleet Street. Even the muscles of my right hand feel as I imagine a servants hand to feel. Curiously enough, I have the same stiffness in manipulating sentences, though by rights I should be better equipped mentally now than I was a month ago. The fortnight in bed was the result of having a tooth out, & being tired enough to get a headache—a long dreary affair, that receded & advanced much like a mist on a January day. One hours writing daily is my allowance for the next few weeks; & having hoarded it this morning, I may spend part of it now, since L. is out, & I am much behindhand with the month of January. I note however that this diary writing does not count as writing, since I have just reread my years diary & am much struck by the rapid haphazard gallop at which it swings along, sometimes indeed jerking almost intolerably over the cobbles. Still if it were not written rather faster than the fastest typewriting, if I stopped & took thought, it would never be written at all; & the advantage of the method is that it sweeps up accidentally several stray matters which I should exclude if I hesitated, but which are the diamonds of the dustheap. If Virginia Woolf at the age of 50, when she sits down to build her memoirs out of these books is unable to make a phrase as it should be made, I can only condole with her & remind her of the existence of the fireplace, where she has my leave to burn these pages to so many black films with red eyes in them. But how I envy her the task I am preparing for her! There is none I should like better. Already my 37th birthday next Saturday is robbed of some of its terrors by the thought. Partly for the benefit of this elderly lady (no subterfuge will then be possible: 50 is elderly, though I anticipate her protest & agree that it is not old) partly to give the year a solid foundation, I intend to spend the evenings of this week of captivity in making out an account of my friendships & their present condition, with some account of my friends characters; & to add an estimate of their work, & a forecast of their future works. The lady of 50 will be able to say how near to the truth I come; but I have written enough for tonight (only 15 minutes, I see).

To resume; I admit I dont like thinking of the lady of 50. Courage however; Roger is past that age, & still capable of feeling, & enjoying & playing a very considerable part in life."
1919.01.22,"Today is Wednesday, Jan. 22nd. Two days more were spent in bed, & today counts as my first of complete health. I even wrote a sentence of alterations and additions this morning. I have a book on Meredith to do for the Times, & we walked this afternoon, so I am back again nearly in my old position. As I can’t get up to London, & only see little framed pictures of Alix & Fredegond sitting by the fire here, I might attempt that solid foundation which I think desirable.

How many friends have I got? There’s Lytton, Desmond, Saxon; they belong to the Cambridge stage of life; very intellectual; cut free from Hyde Park Gate; connected with Thoby; but I can’t put them in order, for there are too many. Ka & Rupert & Duncan, for example, all come rather later; they belong to Fitzroy days; the Oliviers & all that set are stamped as the time of Brunswick Sqre; Clive I put a little aside; later still there are the cropheads, Alix, Carrington, Barbara, Nick, Bunny. I must insert too the set that runs parallel but does not mix, distinguished by their social & political character, headed perhaps by Margaret & including people like Goldie, Mrs Hamilton, & intermittent figures such as Matthaei, Hobson, the Webbs—no, I can’t include either the darkies, or Dr Leys, though they stand for the occasional visitor who lunches & retires to L.’s room to talk seriously. I have not placed Ottoline or Roger, & again there are Katherine & Murry & the latest of all, Hope Mirrlees, who recalls Pernel & Pippa & outlying figures such as Ray & Oliver. Gertler I must omit (& Mary Hutch, too) for reasons which if my account gets written I might give; & Eliot I liked on the strength of one visit & shall probably see more of, owing to his poems which we began today to set up.

This is a very partial account, but I shall never place half of them accurately unless I start straight away. Lytton & Desmond & Saxon then. Well, I cherish a considerable friendship for each of them; the worst of it is how seldom we meet. With Lytton & Desmond till last month tethered to a stool in the Admiralty, months pass without a sight of them. The season of letter writing is over for all of us, I think; or perhaps we need different correspondents. Brilliant letters we wrote each other once, partly for the sake of being brilliant, & we were getting to know each other then, & there was a thrill about it (I speak of my own feelings.) But when we do meet, there is nothing to complain of. Lytton is said to be more tolerant & less witty; Desmond, they say, needs a glass of wine; Saxon has his rheumatics & his hopeless love affair. Lytton again is famous these last six months, but as that was a matter of course since his first six months there is not much surprise or change in it. Moreover, I hear he has abandoned his Asquiths or they are provided with some later light. Nothing is easier or more intimate than a talk with Lytton. If he is less witty, he is more humane. Presumably, judging from precedent & taking into account the demobilisation of the army, he is now preparing to fly, but as his alliance is not with me the direction he flies in makes very little difference. I like Carrington though. She has increased his benignity. O yes, if he were to walk in at this moment we should talk about books & feelings & life & the rest of it as freely as we ever did, & with the sense, on both sides I think, of having hoarded for this precise moment a great deal peculiarly fit for the other."
1919.01.24,"Oddly enough, the day after writing this sentence I got into touch with Lytton, after a lapse of six months or so, on the telephone. & he is to dine here next Friday. But to resume. There are three words knocking about in my brain to use of Stracheys,—a prosaic race, lacking magnanimity, shorn of atmosphere. As these words have occurred automatically, & will tease me till written down, I daresay there is some truth in them. All the unpleasantness that I wish to introduce into my portrait of Lytton is contained in them, as if in deep wells. I shall only need one drop of this gall for his portrait, but I fancy a tinge of the kind is perceptible in him too—far more in James, Oliver & Marjorie. Roger’s version is that all, except Lady S., lack generosity. It is an air, a vapour, an indescribable taste of dust in the throat, something tickling & irritating as well as tingling & stimulating. But then one must combine with this a great variety of mental gifts, & gifts of character—honesty, loyalty, intelligence of a spiritual order. One might almost attribute what I mean in Lytton’s case at least to lack of physical warmth, lack of creative power, a failure of vitality warning him not to be spendthrift but to eke out his gifts parsimoniously, & tacitly assume his right to a superior share of comfort & opulence. In matters of emotion this has a slightly stingy appearance, nor is he ever unthinkingly generous & magnanimous, risking himself. Mentally of course it produces that metallic & conventionally brilliant style which prevents his writing from reaching, to my judgment, the first rate. It lacks originality, & substance; it is brilliant, superbly brilliant journalism, a supremely skilful rendering of the the old tune. Written down these words are too emphatic & linear; one should see them tempered & combined with all those charming, subtle & brilliant qualities which compose his being in the flesh. But when I think of a Strachey, I think of someone infinitely cautious, elusive & unadventurous. To the common stock of our set they have added phrases, standards, & witticisms, but never any new departure; never an Omega, a Post Impressionist movement, nor even a country cottage, a Brunswick Square or a printing press. We Stephens, yes, & even Clive, with all his faults, had the initiative, & the vitality to conceive & carry our wishes into effect because we wished too strongly to be chilled by ridicule or checked by difficulty. Even in the matter of taking Tidmarsh Lytton had to be propelled from behind, & his way of life insofar as it is unconventional, is so by the desire & determination of Carrington."
1919.01.30,"Such is the cold today that I doubt whether I can go on with my disquisition. On such a day one would need to be of solid emerald or ruby to burn with any flame, & not merely dissolve in grey atoms in the universal grey. I saw no one in Richmond High Street who seemed to be burning with the intensity of ruby or emerald—poor pinched women, absolutely mastered by circumstances, though I did hear one speak of going home to get tea ready, which suggested the possibility of some individual life for her. A child threw her hat into the area which I had to recover, & made a whole row of them laugh by tossing it up twice so that it fell into the area again; then the Poles require copies of the In⁠[ternational]. R⁠[eview]. to be sent to Paris; & here is Nelly to say two servants may call in to see me about Nessa’s place. To my chronicle of Lytton I can only add that he writes today to put us off, being fled to Tidmarsh, since “Calvé is ill, & cannot meet me at Heinemann’s”. What he should be doing with Calvé, I dont know; but the information thus vouchsafed, suggests—well, further speculations of mine upon fame, jealousy, vanity, & so forth which I wait a more congenial season to unfold. Owing to this incubus of my friends I have said nothing of a visit from Alix, from Norton, from Fredegond, nor traced some rather interesting revelations, or developments, which may bear fruit one of these days. Alix is thinking of taking a house in Gordon Sqre “chiefly in order to live with James” she said; & this, as she announced it to L., me, & Saxon, had some quality in it that for the moment made my blood run cold. Now, to tune myself up I am going to shut Mrs Watts upon George Frederic, & open the Antigone of Sophocles. One second—I must note for future use, the superb possibilities of Freshwater, for a comedy. Old Cameron dressed in a blue dressing gown & not going beyond his garden for 12 years, suddenly borrows his son’s coat, & walks down to the sea. Then they decide to proceed to Ceylon, taking their coffins with them, & the last sight of Aunt Julia is on board ship, presenting porters with large photographs of Sir Henry Taylor & the Madonna in default of small change."
1919.01.31,"Here I solace my restlessness as usual upon returning from the Club upon this book. I visited the Omega, & heard Roger wheedling a fat German lady to buy stuff, & doing his best to be polite to Mr Powell, an art gentleman who makes glass in South Kensington I suppose, & can believe. Thence through streets of frozen mud, snow, slush, slippery & congealed into little knobs like those on an astrachan coat, to the Club (& here I am interrupted by the voice of my dear old friend, Desmond, upon the telephone—10 minutes discourse. Yes, he’s taking a house at Oare, perhaps, & wishes us to be near him, & will come on Tuesday to bring a story, & is lodging at Littlehampton, & will subscribe to the Review, & send a flimsy for 10/—no, 12/-of course, & they’ve let Wellington Square, & propose to live cheap & spend half the year in the country, which he doesn’t much like, but there it is. Here, with sympathetic enquiries about my health & tooth, we ring off.) Yes, its sympathy that Desmond has; & thus I’m switched back again to old Lytton. But old Lytton I must at once acquit of wishing to impress me with his Calves & his Heinemanns; I think he mentioned a concert, & this is it. Let me try to account for the fact that he has ‘dominated’ (why, even the word is his) a generation at Cambridge, & make it square with my disparaging remarks. How did he do it, how is he so distinct & unmistakable if he lacks orginality & the Tues Feb 4th rest? Is there any reputable escape from this impasse in saying that he is a great deal better than his books? or am I too chary of praise for those books? Am I jealous? Do I compare the 6 editions of Eminent Victorians with the one of The Voyage Out? Perhaps there’s a hint of jealousy; but, if I underrate, I think the main cause is that while I admire, enjoy up to a point & up to a point agree, I’m not interested in what he writes. Thomas Hardy has what I call an interesting mind; so have Conrad & Hudson; but not Lytton nor Matthew Arnold nor John Addington Symonds.

Life is getting crowded out altogether. But life hasn’t been very enjoyable these last few days. Conceive a conspiracy of fog, frost, strike on Tube railways, & on top of that servant hunting for Nessa. This last has ended disastrously. I braved Mrs Abbey once more yesterday, snatched my Phoebe Crane from the jaws of mistresses innumerable, only to hear now that she’s not wanted, & must be put off with a pound note to solace her. This is the imposing pinnacle to my fortnights castle building with Budge & the rest; the cards fall down & things are as they were. Letters upon letters have been written in that bold hand & business like style unnatural to me, telegrams sent, Nelly entreated, brains ransacked, & journeys of penitence made with the result that 32/- is now scattered among undeserving people. But I must record a little sunshine today, less cold; &, to balance that, the district railway on strike.

Desmond has not rung up. That is quite a good preface to the description of his character. The difficulty which faces one in writing of Desmond is that one is almost forced to describe an Irishman: how he misses trains, seems born without a rudder to drift wherever the current is strongest; how he keeps hoping & planning, & shuffles along, paying his way by talking so enchantingly that editors forgive, & shopmen give him credit & at least one distinguished peer leaves him a thousand in his will."
1919.02.15,"What a disgraceful lapse! nothing added to my disquisition, & life allowed to waste like a tap left running. Eleven days unrecorded. Still I think if I were a painter I should only need a brush dipped in dun colour to give the tone of those eleven days. I should draw it evenly across the entire canvas. But painters lack sub⁠[t]⁠lety; there were points of light, shades beneath the surface, now, I suppose, undiscoverable. The predominant tint was furnished by the need I was under of visiting Registry Offices in the coldest weather of the year. It seems to me that I must have visited a dozen; three was in truth the utmost. But then one was on the verge of civilisation, on the outskirts of Fulham; & how hard, contained, & disillusioned the eyes of the women at the desks become, as if glued in front of them they saw eternally a cook of doubtful character! They can scarcely draw a veil of politeness over them at the sight of me, dressed up in red velvet & fur for their benefit. In the end somehow, Nelly had to go to Charleston for a week, & Phoebe Crane recovered from her illness, & was despatched there, so that peace is temporarily renewed.

Yesterday, Friday, I had one of my occasional galas. Dressed in my best I went to Sickert’s pictures, which I here pronounce the pleasantest, solidest most painter-like show in England. & there I met Clive & Mary; Clive in his fur coat, Mary in the more subdued style of the New English [Art Club]. Put a yellow cane in Clive’s hand, & hang a ribbon from an eyeglass, & he would step out of a sporting print—no, a caricature tinted with pinks & yellows. He introduced me to young Nevinson, with the Prince Albert whiskers—making allusion to our both being “such celebrated figures”, which Nevinson did not appreciate. Later, Clive, Mary & I strolled chattering like a perch of parrokeets, to Verreys, with its blue paint & gilt devices. Mary had a dutiful visit to pay her husband in hospital. So we sat & talked in an inner room,—a pleasant, dissipated place, parquet floor—curved bar, little tables—green & gold flourishes, dilapidated George the 4th style, & empty at this hour, save for some dubious ladies. We talked. We vibrated in sympathy. We billed & cooed. Rosy lights shone on his cheeks. Our intercourse was very gay, vibrant, like that of stringed instruments. Duncan passed through—a strange shaggy interlude, but, always & inevitably harmonious. He blinked as if newly exposed to the light, crumbled his brioche, & gulped down his coffee, stammering out his half articulated but immensely expressive words; & saying, I remember, how Art & Letters was the dullest & dreariest of papers (“I’ll show it you—no, its not in that pocket—no, I don’t know where it is.”) & how Julian & Quentin were so much cleverer than most children. Somehow, too soon, he hoisted himself into an astonishing long straight black coat, like a non-conformist ministers, hitched down his red waistcoat, & started off in a vague determined way to Victoria Station. And then we sat on, Clive & I, talking of writing, of my writing chiefly, which he praises sufficiently to give his strictures a good deal of force. As I half suspected, he found grave faults in that crude laborious novel of mine; & excessive merits in the Mark; the best prose, he said, written in our day. Mary came in & interrupted, or rather influenced the current of our discourse, for she hardly spoke, & then we turned out into Regent Street where the lamps were lit, & the shop opposite had all its windows full of bright clothes against a green stage scene, & so strolling in the spring twilight & laughing still we made our way through Soho, & I left them, in a street with many jewellers windows."
1919.02.18,"Here I sit waiting for Alix, who can’t be coming to disburden herself of confidences as I supposed; & thus my mind returns by way of her fickleness to my friends. Where was I? Desmond, & how I find him sympathetic compared with Stracheys. It is true; I’m not sure he hasn’t the nicest nature of any of us—the nature one would soonest have chosen for one’s own. I dont think that he possesses any faults as a friend, save that his friendship is so often sunk under a cloud of vagueness, a sort of drifting vapour composed of times & seasons separates us & effectively prevents us from meeting. Perhaps such indolence implies a slackness of fibre in his affections too—but I scarcely feel that. It arises rather from the consciousness which I find imaginative & attractive that things don’t altogether matter. Somehow he is fundamentally sceptical. Yet which of us, after all, takes more trouble to do the sort of kindnesses that come his way? who is more tolerant, more appreciative, more understanding of human nature? It goes without saying that he is not an heroic character. He finds pleasure too pleasant, cushions too soft, dallying too seductive, & then, as I sometimes feel now, he has ceased to be ambitious. His ‘great work’ (it may be philosophy or biography now, & is certainly to be begun, after a series of long walks, this very spring) only takes shape appears, I believe, in that hour between tea & dinner, when so many things appear not merely possible but achieved. Comes the day light, & Desmond is contented to begin his article; & plies his pen with a half humorous half melancholy recognition that such is his appointed life. Yet it is true, & no one can deny it, that he has the floating elements of something brilliant, beautiful—some book of stories, reflections, studies, scattered about in him, for they show themselves indisputably in his talk. I’m told he wants power; that these fragments never combine into an argument; that the disconnection of talk is kind to them; but in a book they would drift hopelessly apart. Consciousness of this, no doubt, led him in his one finished book [Remnants], to drudge & sweat until his fragments were clamped together in an indissoluble stodge. I can see myself, however, going through his desk one of these days, shaking out unfinished pages from between sheets of blotting paper, & deposits of old bills, & making up a small book of table talk, which shall appear as a proof to the younger generation that Desmond was the most gifted of us all. But why did he never do anything? they will ask.

At any rate in his own intermittent way Desmond is faithful. So much [one] may affirm of Saxon too, who comes next on my list. But Saxon’s fidelity is almost that of the senile colly, or broken down ass—the pensioner who can draw upon a memory of the past for a seat at one’s table in perpetuity. His present condition makes him appear almost exclusively in the character of almoner. He has little to give at the moment, life has not been generous to him. His possessions are old friendships, old memories—things we’ve talked of ages ago. Unlike the rest of us he has had no renewal of life in marriage; his hopes in that direction have been crushed. Therefore he comes to me disconsolately, grudgingly, ungenerously were the cause not one beyond his reach, asking rather than giving; asking at this moment that I shall accept Barbara at his hand—return her to him enriched with the glow of my approval. And Barbara does not appear to me somehow of that metal—that rarity—However, poor Saxon’s life is now in the uncomfortable & unbecoming season which is so painfully well reproduced out of doors. Sleet, & mud & chill, & nothing growing; no warmth, no brilliancy, not even a modest domestic glow. He lodges with Stagg in Great Ormond Street, & has summed up his own position accurately as that of one who finds himself lonely if alone, & bored if in company. But faithful—there is something worth having in Saxon’s fidelity; something that makes his most meagre visitation not altogether fruitless. One is aware, even after two hours of tepid & almost entire silence, that he is strictly true, genuine, unalloyed. You would never find him wanting; never find him callous, insincere, or grudging the last farthing of his possessions. Granted that he is not richly supplied with the gifts one might need, still I come to think in my weary age that safety—a modest competence—a truth as flawless as diamond or crystal—is not negligible, nor without its curious flashes of high remote beauty. At any rate I rest on the thought of Saxon with some relief after hovering for the past two months in a state of uncertainty over the thought of Katherine Murry. I might turn round what I have written of Saxon in order to make a background on which to paint a portrait of Katherine. It is at this moment extremely doubtful whether I have the right to class her among my friends. Quite possibly I shall never see her again. Upstairs I have letters in which she speaks of finding the thought of me a joy, dwelling upon my writing with excitement; I have letters making appointments, pressing for visits, adding postscripts of thanks & affection to visits already paid. But the last is dated December, & it is now February. The question interests, amuses, & also slightly, no, very, decidedly pains me. If it were not that I suspect her of wishing to produce precisely these emotions, save that of amusement, I should be still more put out. As it is—well I should need to write a long description of her before I arrived at my queer balance of interest, amusement, & annoyance. The truth is, I suppose, that one of the conditions unexpressed but understood of our friendship has been precisely that it was almost entirely founded on quicksands. It has been marked by curious slides & arrests; for months I’ve heard nothing of her; then we have met again upon what has the appearance of solid ground. We have been intimate, intense perhaps rather than open; but to me at anyrate our intercourse has been always interesting & mingled with quite enough of the agreeable personal element to make one fond—if that is the word—as well as curious. I was at pains to go up to Hampstead every week since mid October or November, I suppose. And then what happened? I go away for Christmas, & we send small bright presents, carefully timed to arrive on Christmas day. I add to mine one if not two long & affectionate letters; I propose to come as soon as I get back. My time in bed prevented this. But meanwhile, for no reason given or to be guessed at with any certainty, she falls silent; I get no thanks, no answers, no enquiries. So suspecting but willing to make every test before coming to conclusions, I asked Murry whether she would like a visit; to which he replied cordially & without the shadow of hesitation. I proposed to go yesterday. About eleven she, or rather the female who keeps house, rang up & put me off, saying that K.M. was too unwell for my visit; but making no suggestion of another time, nor have I any word from her or K. this morning."
1919.02.21,"But all this is made to appear rather fine drawn & exaggerated by the simple fact that I have a letter this morning from K.M. herself asking me to tea on Monday & explaining how some new treatment gives her fever for two days & makes it impossible for her to see people. Also I am asked to write for the Athenaeum, so that little scratch in my vanity is healed. Not that I want to review any more books than come my way already. But owing to my laborious, & it appears rather misleading, accounts of my friends life has been too much neglected. Let me recollect. On Sunday last Saxon & Barbara dined here; but did little more than dine, since she had to return to feed her baby. She came frisking into the room; but her mind is a sedate literal mind; the pity is that she cant always be in a state of bodily frisk. That is her natural element, I’m sure; to expect quiet talk is against nature. Saxon watches her, judging I suppose that her charms provide for them both. I let myself in for a visit to Faith’s; a tea, to see the Baby. Faith will shortly add to the race herself. A discontent is roused in me at this proceeding on her part. I’m a human being myself; I scarcely feel that Faith will do us credit. She is a lax satirical woman, finding sharp things to say, & already at 28 possessed of a grievance. There she lounges over her fire arranging little mosaic patterns of all of us in a peevish way, & making it appear that she has no other interest in life. One feels her mind a very magpies larder of gossip. Oh yes, she knew of my meeting with Hope Mirrlees; & informed me that she supposed I was one of those unstable friends, rejoicing in quarrels. She had apparently given the matter some thought. In contrast to her Barbara was ‘very nice’; direct, unaffected, sympathetic, as far as her wits will carry her; & in some queer fashion of her own a personality. I wonder what this rises from. On the doorstep in the dark she hinted her concern for poor old Saxon. And then Saxon rang me up to apologise for not staying longer, & suggest another visit."
1919.02.25,"Well, I haven’t even quarrelled with Mirrlees—my literary ladies are faithful, though intermittent, whether purposely or not, I don’t undertake to say. But these speculations obliterate what I see I call ‘life’. The truth is I shirk the gigantic task of giving an account of Sundays teaparty, at which I met Sir Val. Chirrol, Sir Henry Newbolt & Lady, Lady Cromer, the Bruce Richmonds, & a scattering of gallant bald cavalry officers, & mounds of South Kensington dowager respectability who must be nameless. Sir Val & Katie both foretold a revolution, & seemed to picture themselves meeting death nobly for the principle of respectability at the hands of the Russian Jews. Russian Jews invest every great city—a people of enormous energy & unscrupulosity—& then, as Sir Val remarked, 1914 will never come again—“not that anyone could accuse me of pacifism”. Meanwhile Sir Henry confessed that music, especially the music of strings, moves the fount of poetry in him, & “something always comes of a concert—something will come this evening”—he assured me, as a priest foretelling a miracle, or a conjuror producing a rabbit, But the amiability of South Kensington is disarming. A kind of modesty veils what is so prominent & disagreeable in the intellectuals. They have an air of saying “I am no one—no one at all. My only function is to be agreeable. Another cup of tea? Do for goodness sake take this arm chair—& let me fetch you a slice of bread & butter—” Thats my impression of the moment; though for some reason it doesn’t encourage one to say anything more interesting than Thank you & please dont trouble, & other phrases of the kind. Of no 23 Cromwell Houses, fronting the stuffed beasts, & quite capable of staring them out of countenance, I will only say that it is furnished on the great South Kensington principle of being on the safe side & doing the thing handsomely. Good Mrs Samuel Bruce went to the Autotype Company & ordered the entire Dutch school to be sent round framed in fumed oak. And so they were; & just covered the staircase walls, leaving an inch or two’s margin in between. The drawing room—no, I cant write it all out; memory preserves only the shoulders of a horse on a gilt easel, & three large seascapes, like slabs of thick bread & butter. The company was decorous & fur bearing as usual; & the music like the voice of spirits in another world enticing the hopelessly damned. Sir Henry wrote a patriotic song to the tune of it. But how nice they are too!—Katie shouldering her way along the streets afterwards, & letting fall sentences of curious remote force, as though she were on top of a mountain, or lost in a mist, as I can’t help feeling these aristocrats are.

Not, however, Lord Eustace Percy. But at him my pen boggles, since I cannot delve any further back into the week. How modestly he started, smoking his pipe like any commoner, like poor rubber faced little Ewer himself, or wry-necked Burns, & then by degrees how authoritative & masterly lie became, & beat the table to make his points, & pulled his audience up short, & bade them “Wait a second”, or asked them “Well, What do you suggest then? What is your answer to that?” like some transcendent head master, to whom the rest of us are but little children spelling out their lesson, very badly stumbling over the long words; & Lord Eustace, in his goodness, undertakes to enlighten us. I got the impression of a very able man & a very aristocratic man, & a very nice man—a combination that is so irresistable as to be alarming. He explained the League of Nations draft.

Very well: but now we come to another of the ornate & decorated tribe; try as she will she can never lay aside her coronet; I mean poor dear old Ottoline. We dined at Gatti’s together last night. I fetched her from the family bosom of Garlands Hotel. She has the slim swaying figure of a Lombardy poplar—the ridges & hollows of the cheeks are the only sign of her years (47 I make them); & a feeble mincing step on the street, like that of a cockatoo with bad claws. She has an indomitable spirit—plucking life out with those same gouty claws as if she were young & had illusions by the score. She had swooped down upon the land agents wife, & upon Rosa Allatini—for no reason save that the land agents wife writes novels, & Rosa Allatini has had her novel burnt by the hangman. Allatini was a bad choice, save that she almost fainted & had to be fed on bath buns, which Ottoline had by her—& confided, of course, the story of her unhappy love, which made it necessary for her to be fed on Bath Buns. Birrell had been to tea, remarking how Queen Victoria liked nothing better than the sight of a drunken man; Lopokova had been discoursing all the afternoon. As we sat a⁠[t] dinner Ott picked up scraps of talk from the other diners, & admired their profiles. And so round to Gordon Square where we found Clive at the top of the house, where I used to stand & write, in the largest arm chair ever seen, by the finest fire, with a screen across the door to keep the draught out, as affable as a cockatoo & as brightly coloured as a macaw. I left them together & lost my train.
"
1919.03.05,"Just back from 4 days at Asheham, & one at Charleston; I sit waiting for Leonard to come in, with a brain still running along the railway lines, which unfits it for reading. But oh, dear, what a lot I’ve got to read! The entire works of Mr James Joyce, Wyndham Lewis, Ezra Pound, so as to compare them with the entire works of Dickens & Mrs Gaskell; besides that George Eliot; & finally Hardy. And I’ve just done Aunt Anny, on a really liberal scale. Yes, since I wrote last she has died, a week ago today to be precise, at Freshwater, & was buried up at Hampstead yesterday where 6 or 7 years ago we saw Richmond buried in a yellow fog. I suppose my feeling for her is half moonshine; or rather half reflected from other feelings. Father cared for her; she goes down the last, almost, of that old 19th Century Hyde Park Gate world. Unlike most old ladies she showed very little anxiety to see one; felt, I sometimes think, a little painfully at the sight of us, as if we’d gone far off, & recalled unhappiness, which she never liked to dwell on. Also, unlike most old Aunts she had the wits to feel how sharply we differed on current questions; & this, perhaps, gave her a sense, hardly existing with her usual circle, of age, obsoleteness, extinction. For myself, though, she need have had no anxieties on this head, since I admired her sincerely; but still the generations certainly look very different ways. Two or perhaps three years ago L. & I went to see her; found her much diminished in size, wearing a feather boa round her neck, and seated alone in a drawing room almost the copy, on a smaller scale, of the old drawing room; the same subdued pleasant air of the 18th Century & old portraits & old china. She had our tea waiting for us. Her manner was a little distant, & more than a little melancholy. I asked her about father, & she said how those young men laughed in a “loud melancholy way” & how their generation was a very happy one, but selfish; & how ours seemed to her fine but very terrible; but we hadn’t any writers such as they had. “Some of them have just a touch of that quality; Bernard Shaw has; but only a touch. The pleasant thing was to know them all as ordinary people, not great men—” And then a story of Carlyle & father; Carlyle saying he’d as soon wash his face in a dirty puddle as write journalism. She put her hand down I remember, into a bag or box standing behind the fire, & said she had a novel, three-quarters written—but couldn’t finish it—nor do I suppose it ever was finished, but I’ve said all I can say, dressing it up a trifle rosily, in the Times tomorrow. I have written to Hester, but how I doubt the sincerity of my own emotions!

Asheham was, I suppose, a qualified success only—at any rate for L. because of the discomfort; for me the discomfort such as it was was chiefly due to Philip [Woolf]’s presence. One couldn’t sink back before the log fire & read Shakespeare. That form of exalted egotism was checked, & I think perhaps Philip felt himself a little of a hindrance, as no doubt, he always feels himself now—an outsider, a spectator; unattached & very lonely. Duncan came over involved in domestic difficulties, & gave him a letter to Mr Hecks the farmer, which he was to deliver yesterday morning, in the worst downpour of the year. But we had two lovely afternoons of spring, when I kept asking myself “Now where are we? What point have we reached? Is this spring or September?” waking with a start to the fact that we are launched on another summer. Those little grey green tassels were decorating the woods, like the design on a Japanese screen. Starting out to fetch milk on one of these days we met Gunn & heard our fate. We’re to go in September. He wants Asheham to live in with his old mother. Oh dear Oh dear!—Each time I walked up the drive I though⁠[t] how nothing was ever so perfect. If it weren’t for the devil of starting something new in me, I should be in despair. L. thinks it easy to make a fetish of a house; which is true; meanwhile we hang suspended. But the need of looking for another house is a source of great pleasure. It drove us all along the Rodmell Road to Mr Stacey’s & there we heard from a pair of drab females in a chaise that Mr Robinson of Iford is going to let; so on we went, to Iford, a thickly set little village on the plain; & found a house with three green columns, a stuffed up drawing room, & a Mrs Robinson, made so L. declared & the number of her children attested, for breeding purposes. Art lamps & iridescent plates attached to the wall demonstrated the gentility of her farmer husband. Evidently they have made themselves very snug, & will want more than we can pay; even if the country there were better than it is. On the whole we incline to aim at Itford farm house—a house that could be made very attractive, with its view & its sun. We have grown out of gentlemen’s houses.

Charleston is by no means a gentleman’s house. I bicycled round there in a flood of rain, & found the baby asleep in its cot, & Nessa & Duncan sitting over the fire, with bottles & bibs & basins all round them. Duncan went to make my bed. Their staff at this moment consists simply of Jenny, the sharp Jewish looking cook; & she having collapsed, spent the afternoon in bed. By extreme method & unselfishness & routine on Nessa’s & Duncan’s parts chiefly, the dinner is cooked, & innumerable refills of hotwater bottles & baths supplied. One has the feeling of living on the brink of a move. In one of the little islands of comparative order Duncan set up his canvas, & Bunny wrote a novel in a set of copy books. Nessa scarcely leaves the babies room, or if she appears for a moment outside, she has instantly to go off & talk to Dan, Jenny’s young man & the future support of Charleston, or to wash napkins, or bottles, or prepare meals. Mrs B. & the children run rapidly to & fro between their rooms. I had an immense long talk with Ann [Brereton] about the health of the Persian cat, which, according to Mrs B. was fatally injured internally while being washed to cure it of nits; so that she demanded chloroform, which Nessa refused, & the cat recovered. Then Quentin had just been suspected of measles—The atmosphere seems full of catastrophes which upset no one; the atmosphere is good humoured, lively, as it tends to be after three months of domestic disaster. In these circumstances, I daresay I had no more than 30 minutes consecutive talk with Nessa, chiefly devoted to the great epic of the Dr the nurse & Emily. But as happens after disaster upon disaster a sudden lightening of calamity appeared this morning: Dan & his mother being engaged, a letter then arrived from a nurse who against all probability seems to wish to come if she may bring a friend. But I broke off in full tide, & had to trudge through mud to Glynde—such mud that when I went into Powell, the land agent, the sleek little clerk looked from my head to my boots in expostulation—as if such a figure couldn’t possibly require a house with 7 bedrooms & a bathroom. Unhappily there seems little chance of finding one. I’ve said nothing of my niece, who must be called so formally, since they’ve cancelled Susanna Paula, & can think of nothing else. She is a wistful, patient, contemplative little creature, examining the fire very meditatively, with a resigned expression, & very large blue eyes. I suppose not much larger than a big hare, though perfectly formed—legs, thighs, fingers & toes—both fingers & toes very long & sensitive."
1919.03.07,"Having smashed my ink pot, I have recourse to safety pots again & purple ink I see dwells in this one; but I can’t use with any effect the muffled respectability of a fountain pen. Yesterday I had a tooth out, to which the bag of a large abscess had attached itself. Harrison showed it me, previous to putting it in the fire; a token of much pain he said. The queer little excursion into the dark world of gas always interests me. I came home in the Tube wondering whether any of the people there suspected its existence. I wake from it, or seem rather to step out of it & leave it to go on hurtling through space while the World of Harrison & Dr Trueby engages my attention—“Open your mouth, Mrs Woolf—Now let me take out this little bit of wood.” Suppose one woke instead to find the deity himself by one’s side! The Christians believe it, I suppose. L. has met an immense number of people these last few days; & I should have told how Sidney Webb finds his book a most remarkable piece of work, & how it is to be printed directly by Clark of Edinburgh, & will be out, perhaps, by June. And my poor old sluggard, Night & Day, is to be taken in a parcel to Gerald [Duckworth], as soon as I can get through with these niggling, bothersome corrections. Lady Wolseley who seems a lady of the utmost distinction since she writes to the Editor of the Times in pencil, finds L.’s memoir of Aunt Anny ‘most admirable’, & the delicacy of his touches ‘a proof of Genius in him’. To balance this satisfactorily my article, according to B.R., is received with acclamation in the office, at home, & in my Club. The Richmonds want to take a house for April & May—possibly we may consider letting them Asheham. If I had L.’s experience I could here give a little story of the Coal Commission & Lloyd George behind the scenes, as reported by Mrs Webb."
1919.03.12,"Sunday was one of my Shelley house afternoons. There I met Clive, & in his company I was less than ever in touch with the gathering—as dusky, fur-clad & discreet as ever, though I fancy that I am less impressed by it all than I was, & even take Shelley House more or less as an ordinary house. I had to talk to Elena about Asheham, & find her so slow in her mind, so accustomed I suppose to the position of an ornate & handsome ornament that she positively can’t understand & scurries in her replies, as if she were a fat spaniel crossing a busy road. And her eyes are without depth. Clive gave me dinner at the Café Royal, which did not much interest me as a show, rather to his disappointment. However towards the end of dinner a woman of doubtful character dining alone with a man threw her glass on the floor, made a great rattle of knives & plates, upset the mustard pot & marched out like an indignant turkey Cock. Was this moment, with the eyes of the diners upon her, what repaid her? Was it for this that she protested? Anyhow she left her man very crestfallen, trying to appear nonchalant; & I daresay that was what she wanted. I couldn’t help thinking of the dreary scene in the flat next morning—the tears, the recriminations, the reconciliation—& next Sunday they’ll dine, I suppose, at another restaurant.

Dining with Clive now I always feel that we mark the change in our circumstances & views; our present is acted on a background of the past. The present is more amiable, considerably gayer than the past; though not perhaps so interesting. Its interest is different, rather, for I was interested in what he told me of Nessa & R. & D.—& in what I could guess of his own attitude; so happy; so vibrant, so epicurean—& yet has he his moments, not exactly of disillusionment, but of feeling that things might have been rather on a larger scale? I doubt it; I fancy he has found his level, & hence his comfort.

On Monday [10 March], I think, we had a day of industry. We are coming to the end of Eliot’s poems—but I’ve forgotten Saturday, when we had Marjorie Strachey, & the Shoves & Saxon to dinner. Saxon, like the sand in the oyster, was the origin of the whole pearl. We cannot quite face Saxon alone; & had recourse to telephone & telegraph to summon others. I doubt that he likes this. He wants more attention than one can give him in company, & he sits silent, outside the magic circle; no lure draws him in. To me the most interesting object that evening was Gumbo; instantly & undoubtingly I thought her changed. She has come to some decision; she has passed some stage. Doesn’t Conrad say that there’s a shadow line between youth & middle age? Well, since I saw her last she has crossed it into the smoother greyer waters beyond. She has just had notice to leave her school on account of her short sight. In old days this would not have mattered much; she would have been on with something new; but when I spoke of her as the acrobat flying from trapeze to trapeze she shook her head; no that is all over. She now has her two rooms in Kensington, lives on her earnings, comes home & is glad to be quiet there, glad to find that her charwoman has lit the fire—Things haven’t turned out well. Jos’s fault, I suppose. The prospect is drearier than I could face in my own case. I begin to see, now, how my friends’ lives are shaping. It looks a little as if Marjorie was to be one of the failures—not that I rank marriage or success in a profession as success. Its an attitude of mind—the way one looks at life.

I must notice that though the sky is as black as water one has washed one’s hands in, a bird is singing romantically & profusely at the window. On our walk today we passed almond trees in full flower. The daffodils are on the point of bursting. But so far I doubt if we’ve had one day of blue sky, or any heat; nor is there any shadow at Kew, where the shade is universal.

Last night Miss Fox, aged perhaps 26, earning her living, living in rooms with a friend, daughter of an Oxford don & Pippa’s secretary, dined here & lectured the Guild on equal pay. Leonard is preparing to dress for the first time since marriage in an assortment of clothes to dine with David Davies & Venizelos. This morning we had notice to quit from Hoper, & the further blow that he will not let us have the [Itford] Farm."
1919.03.15,"Today was to have been the happiest of the week, & then among my letters was one from Duncan, which looked to me ominous, & proved of course to contain a demand for Nelly as soon as possible. What else but a demand is it when he says that Nessa is becoming completely knocked up by incessant work & responsibility? So I have wired to say she will go if possible for 3 weeks; & the prelude to the wire was unpleasant, & the postscript will be still more so. For the moment this house represents a little island of refuge to the childbearers; Karin rang up last night to suggest that we should take Ann, Judith & Mabel for a fortnight, which fortnight they are going to spend at Asheham. But no one can see how difficult it is to detach a cook or to take in children when one’s organisation is framed on a different scale—however its enough to live one’s disagreeables without writing them. Moreover we refused to take Mabel & Ann & Judith.

On Thursday Bruce & Elena dined here—rather an event. But it went off peaceably enough. They, at least, are well beyond the shadow line; I found him mellower & milder & less spruce than I expected, which pleased me in the admiring editor of my works. As for Elena her distinction in black with a jade jewel is undeniable; her white hair too, on the top of a face coloured like almond blossom; & with all this stateliness & repose an air, if I mistake not, of melancholy, as of hopes not realised & acquiescence accepted instead of something warmer, which slightly touched me, guessing the cause of it. Her notes are very few. But she could discuss the Indian Bill with L. & Indian religions; so that I daresay her slowness & apparent stupidity are only that she finds herself out of her element with me. We talked, much about Asheham of course, & the evening passed quietly, sedately, & with only one or two of those awkward pauses which I remember in their house. He treats her rather as a large magnificent child. “O you’ll like that” he said when I offered her a bulls eye, & she told me she had noticed a very nice sweetshop in the street. I fancy that Bruce is a kindly & very unambitious man, who has been quite pleased to spend his time in doing kindnesses to poverty stricken young men & fitting the articles into the advertisements in the Supplement, which he says is not such as easy job as it looks. “When the great catastrophe happens” he said, alluding to Lord Northcliffe, there is a Walter who is going to buy back the Times, & make it into a decent paper again. They went down to see Asheham on Friday, but the result is not yet known to us. L. is right I think in saying that Elena’s place ought to be in a big house in a village, distributing alms. I asked vaguely for a compositor & she undertook very scrupulously to find me one, being in touch of course with various organisations.

On Friday I went to London & had tea with Mrs Hamilton—Molly that is: I had to correct myself half a dozen times. L. has now got into the habit of lunching in London twice a week, & so appeasing the gaping maws of Green & Matthew. Murry is in the next room & has asked L. to do the social, I mean social reform, side of the Atheneuam, pressing upon him a large yellow book for review. James [Strachey] has extracted the post of dramatic critic. Eliot may be sub-editor. The first number comes out on April 4th. These little bits of literary gossip strike me as slightly discreditable. They point perhaps to one’s becoming a professional, a hack of the type of Mrs W. K. Clifford, who used to know exactly what everyone was paid, & who wrote what, & all the rest of it. I can see father listening with disapproval but secret enjoyment. Mrs Hamilton made me feel a little professional, for she had her table strewn with manuscripts, a book open on the desk, & she began by asking me about my novel; & then we talked about reviewing, & I was interested to hear who had reviewed Martin Schüler, & was a little ashamed of being interested. She told me a curious thing about the sensibilities of my family—Adrian had asked her to tell me how much he’d liked The Voyage Out, which he has just read for the first time, & is too shy to write & tell me so himself. She has 2 or 3 sisters, all artists according to her, though the designs for stained glass that I saw didn’t seem to me to prove it; & one is a poet, who surrounds herself with sketches of projected books on every conceivable subject, & has written a long poem which she wants us to consider publishing. “She is a poet—certainly a poet”, she said, which roused my suspicions. The truth is that Molly Hamilton with all her ability to think like a man, & her strong serviceable mind, & her independent, self-respecting life is not a writer. But we exchanged the plots of our novels, & said “How very interesting—”"
1919.03.19,"Life piles up so fast that I have no time to write out the equally fast rising mound of reflections, which I always mark down as they rise to be inserted here. I meant to write about the Barnetts, & the peculiar repulsiveness of those who dabble their fingers self approvingly in the stuff of others’ souls. The Barnetts were at any rate plunged to the elbow; red handed if ever philanthropists were, which makes them good examples; & then, unquestioning & unspeculative as they were, they give themselves away almost to the undoing of my critical faculty. Is it chiefly intellectual snobbery that makes me dislike them?—is it snobbery to feel outraged when she says “Then I came close to the Great Gates”—or reflects that God = good, devil = evil. Has this coarseness of grain any necessary connection with labour for one’s kind? And then the smug vigour of their self-satisfaction! Never a question as to the right of what they do—always a kind of insensate forging ahead until, naturally, their undertakings are all of colossal size & portentous prosperity. Moreover, could any woman of humour or insight quote such paeans to her own genius? Perhaps the root of it all lies in the adulation of the uneducated, & the easy mastery of the will over the poor. And more & more I come to loathe any dominion of one over another; any leadership, any imposition of the will. Finally, my literary taste is outraged by the smooth way in which the tale is made to unfold into full blown success, like some profuse peony. But I only scratch the surface of what I feel about these two stout volumes.

On Monday after many failures I met Murry at the Club & we had our talk about the Athenaeum. Success has already begun to do for Murry what I always said it would do. He is more freshly coloured, even in the cheeks, than when we last met; & his mind has its high lights. Why, he chuckled like a schoolboy; his eyes shone; his silences were occupied with pleasant thoughts, I think; not that he would admit that to edit the Athenaeum was much more than preferable to a place in a government office. He talked so much about his plans, & with such zest that we sat there from 4.45 to 6.30, or past, & I had to rush. In fact I only caught my train owing to my skill as a psychologist. We were discussing his poetry, & his standing as a poet, with some intensity on his part, so that he lay back, & looked very intently at the ceiling. I was interested but guilty about dinner waiting. So I said “Yes, its true writing for one’s own press is very pleasant—Now next week I have to take my novel to Gerald Duckworth—” “Ah” his eyes came down from the ceiling at once. “What’s it called?—Oh yes—it’ll be out in the autumn I suppose. Well, d’you know I’m afraid I must be going.”

Murry is much of a small boy still, I think, in spite of his tragic airs. I suspect his boast will come true; the Athenaeum will be the best literary paper in existence in 12 months.

“What will you write Virginia?” he asked. Am I too modest in thinking that there was a shade of the perfunctory in the question? Anyhow I didn’t persecute him with any degree of pressure. I offered to look in on Thursdays sometimes & get a book; sometimes to suggest an article; he agreed quite cordially. We went over all his names, & tried to think of others, but agreed that once our intimate friends were gone through the field was mown of its poppies. The younger generation promises very little so far. An editor naturally sweeps the young writers very carefully. I doubt that I was so much of an incubus to Richmond as I thought. While we were demurring a little to the idea of James as dramatic critic, the dramatic critic looked in & saw us. I recommended Desmond for the star part. Katherine will do 4 novels every week—pray to God she don’t do mine! I feel the acid in her once more—since she doesnt take the trouble to write a card to fix an engagement; but I shall try to go up there tomorrow & judge the situation with my own eyes. Today we finished printing Eliot’s poems—our best work so far by a long way, owing to the quality of the ink. MacDermott has done Murry’s poem with such blots & blurs that we must at any rate reprint the title page."
1919.03.22,"Today among other things the coal strike is postponed, & the Guards march through London. L. might have seen them, but thought it not worth the loss of his seat in the Tube. As to private news, our new bookcase came & one part has been set up in the drawing room: the other is too large to get upstairs to my room. Further we have decided to take 2 cottages at Tregerthen if we can get them; & this brings me to Katherine Murry from whom I heard of them. The inscrutable woman remains inscrutable I’m glad to say; no apologies, or sense of apologies due. At once she flung down her pen & plunged, as if we’d been parted for 10 minutes, into the question of Dorothy Richardson; & so on with the greatest freedom & animation on both sides until I had to catch my train. Perhaps its I who live in the suburbs & think it necessary to answer letters; that would be a proper retort to my jest of the underworld. But something—something dark & catastrophic possibly to do with Murry—has taken place since we met. So much she hinted; but said she wished now to forget it—something that had absorbed her, apparently. But this was a momentary revelation as I left. Otherwise, as I say, we chattered about the Athenaeum mostly, & I was much complimented to hear how much they wish for my writing, in proof of which I have a book this morning from Murry. And again, as usual, I find with Katherine what I don’t find with the other clever women a sense of ease & interest, which is, I suppose, due to her caring so genuinely if so differently from the way I care, about our precious art. Though Katherine is now in the very heart of the professional world—4 books on her table to review—she is, & will always be I fancy, not the least of a hack. I don’t feel as I feel with Molly Hamilton that is say, ashamed of the inkpot. Before this I met Hope Mirrlees at the Club—a very self conscious, wilful, prickly & perverse young woman, rather conspicuously well dressed & pretty, with a view of her own about books & style, an aristocratic & conservative tendency in opinion, & a corresponding taste for the beautiful & elaborate in literature. For example, she had been examining Swift as to his use of words; whether he used them properly, & found him deficient compared with Burke, who writes from this point of view magnificently though detestably from any other. She uses a great number of French words, which she pronounces exquisitely; she seems capricious in her friendships, & no more to be marshalled with the long goose wand which I can sometimes apply to people than a flock of bright green parrokeets.

‘Will you write to me, Hope?” I asked.

“O no. I can’t write to people.”

So we parted in the Charing Cross Road for the next six months, I suppose.

But to tell the truth what I’m thinking about most is neither Katherine nor Hope, but the two cottages at Higher Tregerthen. About now, I suppose, Captain Short of St Ives is opening my letter."
1919.03.27,"Captain Tregerthen Short has now got my letter, & written me an answer, & even drawn me a sketch, & appears not only willing but anxious to let us have his three cottages, at a rent of a year each. I have replied, also in the course of these last few days, that we will probably take them, & truth to tell, I have spent the greater part of the time on the slope beneath our house, which Leonard has already planted with fuchsias, or crouched on a rock, watching the great foam swirl of the waves. In a pessimistic walk by the river yesterday L. made this capacity for being happy first at Asheham, then at Tregerthen, the text of a discourse upon the illusory nature of all pleasures & pains; from which he concludes that mankind is a wretched tribe of animals, & even the works of Shakespeare no good save as his skill in doing it excites one’s pleasure. Shall I own that I attribute some of this to my wretched family, who asked me up to dine with them, & I went? & also to Night & Day which L. has spent the past 2 mornings & evenings in reading? I own that his verdict, finally pronounced this morning gives me immense pleasure: how far one should discount it, I don’t know. In my own opinion N. & D. is a much more mature & finished & satisfactory book than The Voyage Out; as it has reason to be. I suppose I lay myself open to the charge of niggling with emotions that don’t really matter. I certainly don’t anticipate even two editions. And yet I can’t help thinking that, English fiction being what it is, I compare for originality & sincerity rather well with most of the moderns. L. finds the philosophy very melancholy. It too much agrees with what he was saying yesterday. Yet, if one is to deal with people on a large scale & say what one thinks, how can one avoid melancholy? I don’t admit to being hopeless though—only the spectacle is a profoundly strange one; & as the current answers don’t do, one has to grope for a new one; & the process of discarding the old, when one is by no means certain what to put in their place, is a sad one. Still, if you think of it, what answers do Arnold Bennett or Thackeray, for instance, suggest? Happy ones—satisfactory solutions—answers one would accept, if one had the least respect for one’s soul? Now I have done my last odious piece of typewriting, & when I have scribbled this page, I shall write & suggest Monday as the day for coming up to lunch with Gerald. I don’t suppose I’ve ever enjoyed any writing so much as I did the last half of N. & D. Indeed, no part of it taxed me as The Voyage Out did; & if one’s own ease & interest promise anything good, I should have hopes that some people, at least, will find it a pleasure. I wonder if I shall ever be able to read it again? Is the time coming when I can endure to read my own writing in print without blushing & shivering & wishing to take cover?

Our dinner last night at the Isola Bella was rather a brilliant affair in the Bohemian style, with a great deal of wine, & talk of books & pictures, & a general air of freedom & content—though I fancy that Roger—I was specially warned by Nessa not to let him know that she & Duncan were in the bath, which casts some light on his point of view. At the end of dinner the Padrone, as we called him, (Clive chattered Italian with the greatest gusto) brought a large sketch book, in which Nessa & Duncan & Roger all drew pictures, & we were rewarded by a bottle of Marsala. Then home; leaving Nessa & Roger in Fitzroy Street, with Clive, Mary & Duncan following behind. We talked by the way a great amount of Athenaeum gossip, all secretly delighted with our own importance; Clive & Roger to do art criticism, the most brilliant list of contributors on record; & indeed I open this book again solely to record the fact that Murry has applied to me for a signed article, which I shall send him.
"
1919.03.30,"I open this book today merely to note that Miss Eleanor Ormerod, destroyer of insects, promises well for Murry: should he take kindly to my first (Eccentrics: I myself rather liked it). That note being made & L. not in yet from Staines I may add that I’m writing by the clear shrewd light of the sun, though its five minutes to the half past five. Last night we changed our watches. So the winter gloom is over, for which I am half sorry, since the dark evening over the fire has its charm. Moreover, should I look out of the window I should see snow in the garden. Yesterday morning the glare of white on trees & roofs when I drew the curtains was dazzling, surmounted too by a bright blue sky, as tender as June; but falsely tender, since outside one was scourged by the bitterest east wind, & I’ve not felt so cold this winter. Cold dashed in one’s face, & whirled up ones legs is far more cruel & harassing than a still profound frost. The Almond blossom is all gone, as if it were Cinderella when the clock struck.

I went up to tea at Gordon Sqre on Friday, having first visited Spicer the paper makers in Upper Thames Street. Clive sat at tea; a little grumpy, growing bald, & now showing a forehead rather in the style of Hall Caine. Very queer, as Nessa said, we all felt, united again in that drawing room as though it were 1907 again, & yet with so complete a re-arrangement of our parts. Perhaps we are all much happier; at any rate more secure & therefore tolerant towards each other. Then on to the Club, & dinner with the Shoves & Marjorie, for whom of course we paid, since they had all come out with no money. Gerald’s buttons burst off too, & his coat came unsewn; & on again across half Mayfair, discreet & semi-lit, to the Club meeting—where my attention was drawn to a large picture, the Rape of the Sabines, I daresay, given by Edward Owensmith in memory of his devoted wife Elizabeth, a Christian mother who went home Feb. 1907—I find it impossible to keep out thoughts about all sorts of things, & found that Marjorie listened attentively; but I can give no record of what happened, save that L. was elected again, 5th."
1919.04.02,"Yesterday I took Night & Day up to Gerald, & had a little half domestic half professional interview with him in his office. I dont like the Club man’s view of literature. For one thing it breeds in me a violent desire to boast: I boasted of Nessa & Clive & Leonard; & how much money they made. Then we undid the parcel, & he liked the title, but found that Miss Maud Annesley has a book called Nights & Days—which may make difficulties with Mudies. But he was certain he would wish to publish it; & we were altogether cordial; & I noticed how his hair is every blade of it white, with some space between the blades; a very sparsely sown field. I had tea at Gordon Sqre; Shepherd [Sheppard], Norton, Nessa, Duncan & later Clive. The disturbing effect of the company is not so great as it was. Yet I feel that the presence of these very brightly lit brains makes things go swiftly, & without padding. And then they have different cups & saucers, & pictures on the walls, & new chair covers. Later I withdrew with Nessa, though to withdraw is very difficult owing to the regulations about coal. Much domestic talk; Lil offering herself, as it proves fruitlessly. Then dinner at the Isola Bella; talk with Clive & Duncan: Clive insisting that Eliot dislikes me, & further trying to convince us that Nessa, Roger, himself, Lytton & I are the most hated people in London; superficial, haughty, & giving ourselves airs—that, I think, is the verdict against the ladies. I admit I hate not to be liked; & one of the drawbacks of Bloomsbury is that it increases my susceptibility to these shades, which are always made very visible by Clive, in so much that I own to have sulked a little under the suspicion that Murry has confided to Clive that he dislikes my article. Home to find L. in bed; a sight to restore confidence. He had dined with Bob Trevy, spoken at South Place, & performed other activities which I give no account of. I mean, he had been to the office, & the League of Nations, & the Labour party, so that between us our range was wide yesterday. Forster is back again, & said by good Dutch Bessy to be ‘more serious’."
1919.04.10,"A great skip, how accounted for I scarcely know. Writing hard at a Times article on novels perhaps used up my desire for activity of the fingers; & then these last few days I’ve been submerged in Defoe; & only steal 10 minutes from Roxana to write this. I have to read one book a day in order to start on Saturday—such is the life of a hack. I went up to tea with Janet, & noticed the signs of age in her; gentle old ladyish smiles, & turns of speech; for her age will be a profitable season. And the Eliots, Walter & Marjorie dined here on Sunday; I amused myself by seeing how sharp, narrow, & much of a stick Eliot has come to be, since he took to disliking me. His wife a washed out, elderly & worn looking little woman, who was relieved to find Walter Lamb with his stories about the King provided for her; & indeed Walter seemed to both the ideal of manhood. Gumbo held forth in her most vivacious & commanding style. I tried to secure Faulker a nurse for Nessa & failed; went up to the Times on Monday & had an interview with Richmond—a restless vivacious little man, jumping onto a chair to see the traffic over the blind, & chivvying a piece of paper round the room with his feet. He offered many suggestions about houses in Cornwall. Yesterday Desmond appeared, & told us the strange story of Elizabeth Asquith & Hugh Gibson, which I have not time to write down, but it is remarkable that 2 years ago she knew nothing of the physical side of the sexes."
1919.04.12,"These ten minutes are stolen from Moll Flanders, which I failed to finish yesterday in accordance with my time sheet, yielding to a desire to stop reading & go up to London. But I saw London, in particular the view of white city churches & palaces from Hungerford Bridge through the eyes of Defoe. I saw the old women selling matches through his eyes; & the draggled girl skirting round the pavement of St. James’ Square seemed to me out of Roxana or Moll Flanders. Yes, a great writer surely to be thus imposing himself upon me after 200 years. A great writer—& Forster has never read his books! I was beckoned by Forster from the Library as I approached. We shook hands very cordially; & yet I always feel him shrinking sensitively from me, as a woman, a clever woman, an up to date woman. Feeling this I commanded him to read Defoe, & left him, & went & got some more Defoe, having bought one volume at Bickers on the way. Then to the Club; & met Alix, all in a new outfit to match the spring; brown too, & happier than usual, being now mistress of 41 Gordon Square, where James is to lodge, though she declares several dusky Brazilians have made their head quarters there. So home with L. walking over Hungerford Bridge on a fine warm evening & thinking of Defoe as I say. L. is now off to address the Cingalese; & Herbert Fisher has astounded us by asking himself to lunch tomorrow, & we have been to Kew, & seen the Magnolia trees in blossom."
1919.04.17,"We saw the magnolia tree in blossom next day with the Minister for Education himself. He is a strange mixture of ascetic & worldling. The lean secluded man now finds himself dazzled by office, & with all his learning & culture swept away by men of vitality & affairs. Such a tribute as he paid to Winston [Churchill] might have been paid by some dazzled moth to a lamp. He seems to see nothing clearly, or else some notion of responsibility forbids him to say what he thinks. He hums & haws when asked a plain question & murmurs on in a husky sort of whisper which seems bodiless & blurred as himself. His whole aspect is that of a worn & half obliterated scholar made spruce by tailors & doing his best to adopt the quiet distinguished manner of those who govern. This is his official side. In private he is a kindly, even affectionate gentleman, simple by nature, though tarnished either by Oxford or by his Fisher blood with a supercilious superficial manner which leads him to dally urbanely & in a way which belittles them with art & letters & everything but politics. This used to irritate—now it merely amuses me. He has long passed the shadow line, & his sarcasms seem directed at phantoms. All clever official men, even poor old Goldie, seem smoothed out of likeness to humanity; & impelled to babble on glibly & entertainingly as if they were under a perpetual contract to keep the high table amused. I do H.A.L.F. the credit to say that he does not give himself airs, save those of a person rendered responsible through no particular merit of his own. We took him to Kew, & chatted of Oxford & Walter Pater, & how Chesterton is a genius, & George Moore another, by way of relief from politics. And he approved of nature too, & likened the Thames beneath a shower to a picture in the Louvre. He stood still on the bank for some minutes, taking in the impression, not as a person who is accustomed to looking at things looks, but rather as a man who collects objects for the good of his soul. So it was too with the buds of the magnolia at Kew.

We had Oliver & Inez to dinner. As one of the couples they must be linked together thus. What binds him to her I did not find it easy to see. Animation perhaps, a kind of brisk professional manner, & it appears that she had read modern poetry & can deliver her opinions as if they were her own. I’m a little doubtful, when I find a cheap ready made young woman out of an office in Oxford Street & lodging at Harrow, enthusiastic about Robinson Crusoe; nor do I attribute it wholly to my intellectual snobbery. Her face, unlike the faces of all the other Cropheads, seemed to me vulgar, & unpleasant. One must remember though that Oliver is now verging upon 50; a little grey at the temples; abrupt & inclined to be snappish; so that his choice is not so wide as it was. However one may abuse the Stracheys their minds remain a source of joy to the end; so sparkling, definite & nimble. Need I add that I reserve the qualities I most admire for people who are not Stracheys? It is so long since I have seen Lytton that I take my impression of him too much from his writing, & his paper upon Lady Hester Stanhope was not one of his best. I could fill this page with gossip about people’s articles in the Athenaeum; since I had tea with Katherine yesterday & Murry sat there mud-coloured & mute, livening only when we talked his shop. He has the jealous partiality of a parent for his offspring already. I tried to be honest, as if honesty were part of my philosophy, & said how I disliked Grantorto on whistling birds, & Lytton & so on. The male atmosphere is disconcerting to me. Do they distrust one? despise one? & if so why do they sit on the whole length of one’s visit? The truth is that when Murry says the orthodox masculine thing about Eliot for example, belittling my solicitude to know what he said of me, I dont knuckle under; I think what an abrupt precipice cleaves asunder the male intelligence, & how they pride themselves upon a point of view which much resembles stupidity. I find it much easier to talk to Katherine; she gives & resists as I expect her to; we cover more ground in much less time; but I respect Murry. I wish for his good opinion. Heinemann has rejected K.M.’s stories; & she was oddly hurt that Roger had not invited her to his party. Her hard composure is much on the surface."
1919.04.20,"We are, for the first time for many years, spending Easter in London. We had arranged to go, but dissolved all our arrangements in 5 minutes; partly to escape what was said to be the worst journey on record; partly that L. may get 10 clear days, which will be possible at the end of the week. I own to some hopes of a wet Easter; but was disappointed. Both Friday & Saturday were of the texture of full summer. We walked along the river & through the park on Good Friday, & the sun made the crowd to swelter unpleasantly. They tramped placidly along, in their coats & skirts & bowler hats, leading their dogs, save for a random terrier who had secured a muzzle. Meanwhile the green of the leaves thrust at least one inch out of the envelopes, & today the tree against the window has some perfectly shaped small leaves, & the tree at the end of the garden is as green as it will be until September. On Saturday Bruce Richmond came in person to fetch my Defoe article; & we had a little talk about mistakes in proofs. He prides himself upon letting none through his fingers;—& charges such as do get through (& I was under the impression they were by no means rare) to Dalton. And then we walked; & I came out in my summer things, shady hat, thin muslin dress, stockings, & cloak on my arm. Today I’m sitting in a jersey & serge over the fire; but the evening repents, & through an open window the birds sing, & the leaves are yellow green in the sun. L. at Staines.

In the idleness which succeeds any long article, & Defoe is the 2nd leader this month, I got out this diary, & read as one always does read one’s own writing, with a kind of guilty intensity. I confess that the rough & random style of it, often so ungrammatical, & crying for a word altered, afflicted me somewhat. I am trying to tell whichever self it is that reads this hereafter that I can write very much better; & take no time over this; & forbid her to let the eye of man behold it. And now I may add my little compliment to the effect that it has a slapdash & vigour, & sometimes hits an unexpected bulls eye. But what is more to the point is my belief that the habit of writing thus for my own eye only is good practise. It loosens the ligaments. Never mind the misses & the stumbles. Going at such a pace as I do I must make the most direct & instant shots at my object, & thus have to lay hands on words, choose them, & shoot them with no more pause than is needed to put my pen in the ink. I believe that during the past year I can trace some increase of ease in my professional writing which I attribute to my casual half hours after tea. Moreover there looms ahead of me the shadow of some kind of form which a diary might attain to. I might in the course of time learn what it is that one can make of this loose, drifting material of life; finding another use for it than the use I put it to, so much more consciously & scrupulously, in fiction. What sort of diary should I like mine to be? Something loose knit, & yet not slovenly, so elastic that it will embrace any thing, solemn, slight or beautiful that comes into my mind. I should like it to resemble some deep old desk, or capacious hold-all, in which one flings a mass of odds & ends without looking them through. I should like to come back, after a year or two, & find that the collection had sorted itself & refined itself & coalesced, as such deposits so mysteriously do, into a mould, transparent enough to reflect the light of our life, & yet steady, tranquil composed with the aloofness of a work of art. The main requisite, I think on re-reading my old volumes, is not to play the part of censor, but to write as the mood comes or of anything whatever; since I was curious to find how I went for things put in haphazard, & found the significance to lie where I never saw it at the time. But looseness quickly becomes slovenly. A little effort is needed to face a character or an incident which needs to be recorded. Nor can one let the pen write without guidance; for fear of becoming slack & untidy like Vernon Lee. Her ligaments are too loose for my taste. But to return to life, albeit with something of an effort. I have forgotten to record Desmond’s visit. His main purpose in coming was to get himself a bed; but I can pardon these self seeking impulses on the part of Desmond very easily. My tolerance in this respect is far greater than poor Mary Sheepshanks’, who remarked bitterly that since she has gone to live at Golders Green her friends pay her visits on Sundays, for the sake of the country air. But then I am happy; & Mary S. is not; every virtue should be natural to the happy, since they are the millionaires of the race. I can give little account of Desmond, seeing that I was under contract to write all the morning, & he arrived late the night before. As L. had been kept by trains failing from reaching home till 8.45, he was out of tune for friendship. Desmond is a very sensitive man. He apologised, & did his best to charm; & did so, in both our cases, I think. But, sure enough, L.’s morning wasted in the sun of his laziness; for though he took a chair into the window & supplied himself with books, the books started ideas, & the ideas had to be communicated, & lying in my bath next door I heard fragments of Lord Robert’s speech read from the Times; & then a disquisition upon the authenticity of Barbellion’s diary; & this had gone on, with one excursion to buy an A.B.C. [Railway Guide] since breakfast. May we therefore be pardoned for inventing a cook’s sister, who was spending the holidays with us; without this dear old Desmond would be smoking his cigarettes & talking about catching a train in the arm chair opposite at this moment. As it was, he had reluctantly to take himself off at lunch time, & fling himself upon a world of crowded trains, & accurate hours; directing his steps towards Oare where they have taken a house, which Molly is engaged upon getting into at this moment. Desmond declared that he had despatched a kitchen table to her; but I own that I doubt it. And who can say whether he has yet reached Oare?"
1919.04.24,"On Easter Monday we went up to visit the Murrys & see Hampstead Heath. Our verdict was that the crowd at close quarters is detestable; it smells; it sticks; it has neither vitality nor colour; it is a tepid mass of flesh scarcely organised into human life. How slow they walk! How passively & brutishly they lie on the grass! How little of pleasure or pain is in them! But they looked well dressed & well fed; & at a distance among the canary coloured swings & roundabouts they had the look of a picture. It was a summers day—in the sun at least; we could sit on a mound & look at the little distant trickle of human beings eddying round the chief centres of gaiety & filing over the heath & spotted upon its humps. Very little noise they made; the large aeroplane that came flying so steadily over head made more noise than the whole crowd of us. Why do I say ‘us’? I never for a moment felt myself one of ‘them’. Yet the sight had its charm: I liked the bladders, & the little penny sticks, & the sight of two slow elaborate dancers performing to a barrel organ in a space the size of a hearthrug. Katherine & Murry & Murry’s brother met us at their door. We thought she would have enjoyed herself, from the likeness of her prose to the scene; on the contrary, she was disgusted. We had rather a stiff tea. Murry’s brother is a bumpkin; & the Rhodesian woman under a cloud of lacerated feelings I suppose; Katherine haggard & powdered; & so on. But it was no one’s fault; & their talk of Tregerthen combined with the image of it on a hot day made us determine to take it here & now. We have written to this effect to Captain Short. I try not to hope, since I feel sure we shall be disappointed.

“Let it three days ago” or no answer at all; that is what I imagine.

Last night the Coles dined here, & gave me my first view of them. Sharp, positive, hard minds; in tense taut bodies; in Cole’s case the mouth seems fixed in a kind of snarl at the world. A positive domineering young man he seemed; & she, with less force, equally sure of herself. A good laugh would do them both good; yet how laugh with those tight stretched drums for cheeks, & those curled sneering lips? I don’t accuse either of them of a desire to be savage or destructive: I write from the outsiders unsympathetic point of view. But Leonard, though he works at their works, is still humane & deliberate. Its the perpetual strife that strings them up in this way, I think; no speculative or contemplative or imaginative power seems to be left them. And what’s it all for? Who gains, even if they do win their victories. But I fancy that Mrs Cole is not a very clever woman; & such wits as she has use up all their force in keeping nimble. She has nothing left over to play with. This I write from the recollection of them which came to me on waking. “I dont like the Coles” I said to myself, before I had time to set my faculties to work upon this judgment.

Tomorrow we go down to Asheham for 10 days; alone; leaving the servants to clean here, & intending to find a house for £35 if we can, for that is our solution at present. The weather has gone to pieces; the image is a true one; it is much as if some serenely sailing ship had been wrecked on a splinter of rock & left only tatters & spars to be tossed in a swelter of grey sea."
1919.05.05,"The day mother died twenty something years ago. The smell of wreaths in the hall is always in the first flowers still; without remembering the day I was thinking of her, as I often do.—as good a memorial as one could wish.

Now it is a fine evening, the first since I wrote here last; & I’m just back from Asheham, Leonard still to come in. A fine but cloudy day; an immense weight of sun piled up behind the clouds. I race through, so as to have time for a bath. Ah but how happy we’ve been at Asheham! It was a most melodious time. Everything went so freely;—but I cant analyse all the sources of my joy—& here’s Leonard in, to find a stack of books from the New Statesman, & the drawing room floor littered with blue-black papers from Roger. Lottie & Nelly chattering away about their house cleaning."
1919.05.07,"& thus my writing got interrupted, but I had the hot bath I remember, after duly, though a little insincerely, admiring what had been done in my absence. To recapitulate the events of Asheham is no longer in my power, or perhaps, since they were mainly of a spiritual nature requiring some subtlety to relate, I’m too lazy to try. Happiness—what, I wonder constitutes happiness? I daresay the most important element is work, & that rarely fails either of us now. Leonard, of course, had his telegram from Sharp, & an article to do in a hurry; but 1500 words now merely fill a morning pleasantly for him. Then there were two moments of some anxiety: first, a letter from Captain Short to say we can have Tregerthen, which we now possess; then a letter from Gerald to say he has read Night & Day with “the greatest interest” & will be delighted to publish it. I suppose, as I go to the trouble of copying his words verbatim, that I was a good deal pleased by them. The first impression of an outsider, especially one who proposes to back his opinion with money, means something; though I can’t think of stout smooth Gerald smoking a cigar over my pages without a smile. However, a good deal beyond this letter in importance was Captain Short’s. For a day to two I did nothing but put my pen down or my book & see Tregerthen. Considering the extreme inhospitality of Eastbourne agents, I daresay we are well advised from a practical point of view, to be sure of some retreat. But Asheham, as if to keep our loyalty, breathed its usual charm. It compares very well with Charleston; indeed I’ve never come back to it without that feeling of being incredulous as one perfection was added to another. This time we spent most of our day in the house, owing to the weather. L. scarcely left the garden. One walk insufficiently clothed to Southease was very bitter. I got over to Charleston, though; & had a night & morning alone with V.—so far as she can ever be alone. There was Pitcher, the new gardener; Angelica; Julian & Quentin of course; the new nurse; & a fire which wouldn’t burn. Indeed living is fairly bare at the moment. I had the rare sensation of its being necessary to eat, in order to support life. They have bread by the yard, as if slid along a slot; all the necessaries; but not an ornament. My life, by comparison, seems padded at every turn. But they all looked as vigorous as possible. The floors strewn with Burnet stuffs for the Flat; & as usual, a good deal of domestic talk; sleep in the ground floor room at night, where this time last year about I heard the nightingales, & the fishes splashing in the pond, white roses tapped at the window: that night when I was told that Angelica was in evidence. Nothing but wind & rain this time, & no coal in the house.

Yesterday, Tuesday, we both renewed London life in the usual way; save that I had to buy stuff for dresses, as well as paper labels & glue. Tea at the Club, where Alix, dusky & dreary, borrowed 10/ in order to give James his dinner. They were going to hear Bertie lecture; I preferred the songsters of Trafalgar Square. The steps of the column were built up, pyramid fashion, with elderly respectable householders grasping sheets of music, which they rendered, in time to a conductor on a chair beneath, with great precision. It was Life boat day, & the elderly people were singing sailor’s chanties & Tom Bowling. This seemed to me a very amusing & instructive spectacle; & being famished for music, I could not get past, but stood & felt thrilled with an absurd visionary excitement; & walked over Hungerford Bridge making up stories."
1919.05.12,"We are in the thick of our publishing season: Murry, Eliot, & myself are in the hands of the public this morning. For this reason, perhaps, I feel slightly but decidedly depressed. I read a bound copy of Kew Gardens through; having put off the evil task until it was complete. The result is vague. It seems to me slight & short; I dont see how the reading of it impressed Leonard so much. According to him it is the best short piece I have done yet; & this judgment led me to read the Mark on the Wall, & I found a good deal of fault with that. As Sydney Waterlow once said, the worst of writing is that one depends so much upon praise. I feel rather sure that I shall get none for this story; & I shall mind a little. Unpraised, I find it hard to start writing in the morning; but the dejection lasts only 30 minutes, & once I start I forget all about it. One should aim, seriously, at disregarding ups & downs; a compliment here, silence there; Murry & Eliot ordered, & not me; the central fact remains stable, which is the fact of my own pleasure in the art. And these mists of the spirit have other causes, I expect; though they are deeply hidden. There is some ebb & flow of the tide of life which accounts for it; though what produces either ebb or flow I’m not sure.

But I have written nothing here for a week, & must cramp myself even now, in order to cut some more covers. Tuesday was written down; on Friday [9 May] I had tea with K.M. & Murry, with whom I now adopt a manner of motherly badinage; which is less fatiguing than the intellectual pose. He has not yet shed all the husks of clever youth. One feels him very unformed essentially, & capable of running on in an excited uneasy state about life such as I can recall in my own past. One tacitly assumed it to be a mark of genius. On Sunday Margaret & Lilian dined here; Margaret tending to be the flowing matron; she increases in size; & one can fancy her fitting a large arm chair, & reluctant to move. They seriously consider resignation. Lilian, M. whispered, is getting unfit for so much work. Poor Janet is depressed at having lost her job, & being fit for no other, & also very hard up. Indeed this is a melancholy season for them all; but J. has more than the usual shadows to depress her. I laughed to myself over the quantities of Armenians. How can one mind whether they number 4,000 or 4,000,000? The feat is beyond me."
1919.05.16,"These swarming hot summer days seem to quicken human life as well as vegetable. One becomes a flower oozing honey upon which ones friends cluster—or such is my version of the relationship. This week we’ve had Ottoline, & Lytton, & I’ve been to see Violet Dickinson, & tonight the Abrahamsons & Oliver Strachey dine with us; on Saturday Logan comes to tea; on Sunday we lunch with the Webbs, to say nothing of invitations we’ve refused, & leaving out a great squash at the 17 Club to hear Forster speak on Egypt, when we met Bob, Altounyan, & Dora Sanger, with the usual varieties of old friends. As usual my mind is too crammed to sift all these wares. Let me attempt Ottoline, since her hat & veil on the sofa beside me recall her. She was, I think L. was right in saying, anxious to come out & inspect us. She struck her unmistakable note on entering the room; rayed with green & blue, like the Cornish sea, & magnificently upright & held together; her blue blood giving her the carriage of assurance & self-respect which is rare among the intellectuals. We have taken, this last week, to dining in the garden, & there we sat on the flawless summer night with the apple trees softly snowed under with blossom, & a moon up. Certain layers of powder showed upon the steeps of her face—but when you reflect that she’s close on 50—& has cropped her hair like a boy! Of course we talked personalities; investigated the case of Mary Hutch. & Eliot; also Gertler; & she was apparently, & as I believe, genuinely, kindly, & well wishing, though considerably bewildered, & bewailing as usual her disasters in friendship, & inclined to blame everyone but herself, though anxious for reconciliations, & plantive rather than bitter. L’s verdict was that she was “very nice”; the first time he has ever said that. The qualities which one has glimpses of in company were steadily visible in this domestic evening, when there was nothing to stimulate, & no effort to rise to.

Her intuitions are more penetrating than many of the profoundly reasonable remarks of our intellectuals; & to me she always has the pathos of a creature vaguely afloat in some wide open space, without support or clear knowledge of its direction. Perhaps she was on her good behaviour—but if so, she was capable of wrapping herself in her great Spanish cloak, & sallying out into the street without her hat; she’s altogether such a fancy dress character that a hat more or less seems immaterial. We put her into her train with young officers who looked up startled; & despatched her to Waterloo.

Next day there was Lytton. I need not repeat the stock observations upon his mellow good humour. It is more to the point to chronicle a renewed sense of affection, which has never been seriously in abeyance, & the usual conviction that his wit & what one calls personality are as peculiar to himself as his voice, or his finger nails. And then one thinks that it doesn’t much matter if his writing is not profound or original; one begins perhaps to suspect that it may be more original than one thinks. He tells his stories of Cunards & Winston & Lord Ribblesdale admirably; with Marjorie’s dramatic talent, & with a finer power of observation. We scrutinised the condition of his soul, with his help, very closely. Ottoline had professed some alarm, We came to the conclusion that it would be absurd not to have this butterfly’s season among the great. The comparison between him & the select Norton, Alix, & James seemed entirely in his favour. The touchstone of virtue with them now is whether you attend Bertie’s lectures or not. I hereby vow to fuddle Alix completely. We sat on the river bank, & he told us of a visit to Irene Vanbrugh, with his comedy; how the singing of her canary birds almost drowned his voice; & how finally she determined against it, finding a lack of human passion. Therefore the comedy is shelved, for ever, I suspect, & he writes, & will continue to write Eminent Victorians.

Perhaps there was a little melancholy at this confession; perhaps a little desire for commendation of Lady Hester Stanhope, which we withheld; or perhaps I judge other writers’ craving for applause by my own. I’ve had Roger’s praise of Kew Gardens by the way, so I suppose I’m still safe, though no longer greeted with such exciting raptures. Indeed the books sell very slowly; & it looks as though the market for such commodities is a small one—infinitesimal; we shan’t even pay our expenses it seems. But with such a variety of matter to choose from, this can scarcely be the fault of the books themselves; it was novelty that sold them at first. I broke from Lytton with regret, & paid my visit to Violet; but she would have been hurt had I shirked it, to judge at least by her pleasure at seeing me. Its odd how people of 50 remain exactly 50. She hasn’t changed a hair for 20 years, which must be the length of our friendship. We take things up precisely as we left them; a years gap makes no difference; we have had our intimacy; something or other has fused; & never hardens again. Thus I felt in talking to her; it was the usual inconsequent, generous minded, unselfish talk. When I come onto the verge of the respectable classes I’m always struck by their unexpectedness: V. is as much of a democrat as I am; as little of an Imperialist; she blames England; she has no hate of Germany; she sends clothes to Russia; & yet she lives in Manchester Street, consorts chiefly with people like the Horners & the Thynnes, & has Ozzie for a brother. Beatrice Thynne has inherited a quarter of a million; two large properties, & one of the finest libraries in England; she has no idea what to make of them; visits them in a distracted way to see which she’d like to live in; can’t make up her mind to settle in either, & finally spends most of her time in Gray’s Inn, looked after by a charwoman. Her only acknowledgement of her balance is that now & then she pulls out strings of pearls, & parades the Squares of the Inn, with such effect that Lady H. Somerset has to beg her to remove them."
1919.05.18,"Our seductive sweetness appears still to be drawing bees from all quarters; last night I went to bed with lips so parched with talking & brain so dazed that I could only tumble into sleep head foremost. As we left lunch & were on the stairs there was a great rapping at the door, & the hall immediately filled with strangers, who eventually became Roger, Pamela, & a strange silent foreign woman whom from her grey hair I took to be Marjorie Fry. We pitched on the grass, under a shower of apple blossom; & there sat until tea; & then Logan came; & we only fell silent at half past six or even later; nor was there a moment of repose, neither for tongue nor brain. It is true that Logan does his turns, which take the form of “delightful adventures—life is like the Arabian Nights—” & good stories, quotations, & recitations; but even these required intelligent attention. He is a very well brushed, bright eyed, rosy cheeked man, seemingly entirely satisfied with life, which he appears to have mastered; visiting each of its flowers, like a bee. These flowers he keeps stored in his waistcoat pocket: lines from Jeremy Taylor, Carlyle, Lamb, &c. An epicurean, I suppose: a little frosty, I conjecture; though kindly & humane of course; rather than human. I believe his motive was to get us to print some new works of his; anyhow he welcomed the invitation to submit them; & he lavished offers of help, & suggestions for increasing our sales; & altogether took the Hogarth Press in hand, & promises us a most splendid future. He proposes to become our agent. One must beware of becoming satellites of his set, however; cherishing single lines, & reprinting the Essays of Elia."
1919.05.22,"A few vegetable notes ought to prelude this page: the weather continues fine; the blue seems eternal; an occasional wind rises; we rock slightly; then steady ourselves, & ride on serenely. The apple blossom, which deluged Ottoline & looked so soft beside her cheeks, is over; 2 red rambler roses are pricking through. We dine of course out of doors to the sound of the fountain. The robins douche themselves there. Last night there were six voices to drown its perpetual dripping—Altounyan, A. & K. & Bob dining with us. I had a vision of Bob as a tory squire; at any rate a conservative, mahogany coloured gentleman, innocent of rhyme. How far this is from the truth may be gauged from the fact that he swells with four separate volumes, & is to be delivered in the autumn. The good shrewd sound Trevelyan stock shows through; moreover he is well cropped & brown for a poet. He is also a comic character, & rises higher in that sphere when he feels himself inspired by laughter. His ungainly compliments to Karin, his eager awkward ways, made us all shout with laughter. Altounyan is an effervescent Armenian, shy, but ready to bubble on provocation either of a literary or political nature. But Bob talked us all down. I must omit an exquisitely flattering duet between me & A. when I had a surfeit of praise for Kew Gardens—the best prose of the 20th century, surpassing Mark on the Wall, possessing transcendent virtues, save for one passage, between the women, & highly admired by Clive & Roger. I was at pains to sweeten his enthusiasm with this relish, since his native product is not of the very highest quality perhaps. Yes, authors are rather a despicable race I think. I’d composed myself to face failure so stoically that this unexpected gift was, at the moment, delicious. Forster approves too. But Altounyan has weighted his praises with a thick wad of mss., written, not typed, which we are to read & consider, & upon our verdict depends the whole of his future. Further, he appointed us his literary executors; everything he writes in Armenia is to be sent to us—to do what we like with. He gave us £2 towards our future. Still, to read a novel in manuscript, & settle a young man’s future, & his wife’s, & his childrens—that is a severe price for 10 minutes of praise. A⁠[drian]. seemed to me to deserve Henderson’s saying “He knows the right sneer for every occasion”. He strikes me as more & more of a moon to the lusty red sun provided by Karin; & the light he throws upon whatever turns up is more & more bleaching and cadaverous. The truth is he has no occupation."
1919.05.25,"The day recalls the fact that we lunched with the Webbs this time last week. I have made no note of it. There was the weak distinguished looking & yet vaguely apologetic Noel Buxton; & Arnott, rather self assertive, on the contrary, owing everything to his wits, & without an ounce of distinction thrown in. I cannot get over my distaste for the Fabian type; though if it came to spending a year on a desert island, I suppose I should choose him rather than Buxton. I don’t know. The Webbs were very quotable. Mrs Webb’s brilliant idea of municipal bricks for children, inscribed with the names of organisations so that in putting them together they would learn their civic duties was almost too much in character to be suitable. Even Sidney had his mild joke at her. Noel Buxton obsequiously offered his son for the experiment. Rich men nowadays can be seen divesting themselves of particles of gold with a view to the eye of the needle. Then later in the week Mrs Woolf & Sylvia came to tea, bringing fresh eggs & lilies of the valley. Sylvia amused me by her assurance that the affairs of Putney are of moment to the world; & her anxiety to get stories of her own house hunting adventures corrected—as though these were matters of importance. And Mrs Woolf, as usual, pleased me by her childishness, by which I mean her freshness & inconsequence, as if all her life were still spent among the little incidents & goings on of a large nursery. She couldn’t face a play, she told me; but she could just manage lunch at the Carlton. Why the boundary line between the impossible comes there I don’t know. And Bella since Bertie’s death finds life necessary to keep up her spirits; & is learning to Jazz; & her eyes prevent her from reading much; but she writes her page in Little Folks; & her friends are all very good to her, & she has gone to Bexhill with Martin & Emma. It is predicted that Martin will be made not quite a knight but the next best thing. Martin believes in orders, I gather, & our laughter at the O.B.E. must have saddened him the other night. Philip is cutting off lambs’ tails, & they are made into a pie at night—Philip who would step aside to avoid a caterpillar, & once fought Harold for using worms for bait, & was chased by Harold to the next village in the Isle of Wight where they were staying “& I ran after them, miles & miles, thinking that the end of the world had come!” Naturally Mrs Woolf had no time to read Sophocles—nor have I for the matter of that.

Lytton came to tea on Friday & half maliciously assured me that my industry amazed him. My industry & my competence, for he thinks me the best reviewer alive, & the inventor of a new prose style, & the creator of a new version of the sentence. People’s compliments generally manage to reserve the particular praise they wish to have themselves. But we are surprisingly honest; we have a clear perception of the others meaning. He asserted that he was disgusted by his own stereotyped ways: his two semi colons; his method of understatement; & his extreme definiteness. Without agreeing, I conveyed my sense of his dangers, & urged him to write plays—stories—anything to break the mould of the early Victorians. After a volume on Victoria, in the same manner, he is going to attempt it. But then money—he must make money—he cant write reviews—& I’ve to do Addison, & other books, & protested that all the same I’m not a hack, & he runs the risk of becoming a Logan, a superior dilettante. To which he agreed, & then we talked about Addison, & read scraps of Johnson’s lives; & so enjoyed ourselves. He told me about Princess Sophia & the d. of Cumberland.

To the Squire’s party."
1919.06.09,"I know I meant to convey my sense of the degradation of the Squire’s party; but the sense has faded, & is not worth recapturing. A week at Asheham has intervened—from one Tuesday to another. An odd thing happened to me at Asheham, where I count upon becoming clearer & more concentrated, & reading print as if through a magnifying glass. The very opposite of this took place. I dozed & drowsed & seemed to feel the sun in my brain sending all my thoughts to seek repose in the shadow. I write there at an open window looking onto the field; & the field was gilt with buttercups; the sheep were tempting in their indolence; in short, I used to find the morning gone & only a few lines written, & so it was with my Addison, or whoever it might be, after tea. Our ship rode so steady that one came to disbelieve in motion or the possibility of change; we appeared wedged in the blue. Perhaps one day there was a cloud; but no harbourage was offered it, & congregation of clouds was impossible. The loveliness of Asheham once again brimmed the cup & overflowed. Wild ideas seized us of building a house at the Lay. To give up every foothold in that region seemed unthinkable. L. bicycled round & brought news of an ancient manor house at Denton, which excited hopes, but the sight of it next day completely dashed them. In order to popularise this large stuffy, ill lit, slightly mouldy & decayed mansion the owner, a London publican dazzled into purchasing by the aristocratic name but unable to induce his wife to live there, hit on the ambitious plan of starting a line of omnibuses to run from London, & deliver their loads at the manor house, where tea would be provided. One such feast was held, as long boards stretched on trestles, & a few dozen green wine-glasses testified; but the device failed; the Londoners had seen more seductive sights than Denton Manor, & it is still in the market. With the notion of building a house running strong in my mind I went to Charleston for a night & was there disabused of such fantasies very completely. To recapitulate a story told verbally several times would be dull. But Nessa & I quarrelled as nearly as we ever do quarrel now over the get up of Kew Gardens, both type & woodcuts; & she firmly refused to illustrate any more stories of mine under those conditions, & went so far as to doubt the value of the Hogarth Press altogether. An ordinary printer would do better in her opinion. This both stung & chilled me. Not that she was bitter or extreme; its her reason & control that give her blame its severity. Anyhow I left in rather a crumpled condition, & paused in Lewes, on L.’s advice, to see a house on the hill. A degree of that refinement & smug efficiency which one finds in Surrey houses set me against the White House; & I trudged down into Lewes again in no cheerful mood, with three hours, moreover, to spend there. To pass the time, more than anything, I asked Mrs Wycherley about houses; & she, after tepidly recommending some that were impossible & sketching the difficulties of the situation, bethought her of one newly on the market, small, old, actually in Lewes, & perhaps a little humble for one used to lodge at Asheham. I pricked my ears; since this is always the way one is told of what one wants. Off I went, up Pipes Passage, under the clock, & saw rising at the top of the sloping path a singular shaped roof, rising into a point, & spreading out in a circular petticoat all round it. Then things began to go a little quicker. An elderly and humble cottage woman the owner, showed me over. How far my satisfaction with the small rooms, & the view, & the ancient walls, & the wide sitting room, & the general oddity & character of the whole place were the result of finding something that would do, that one could conceive living in, that was cheap (freehold £300) I don’t know; but as I inspected the rooms I became conscious of a rising desire to settle here; to have done with looking about; to take this place, & make it one’s permanent lodging. Perhaps later it will amuse me to read how I went from one grade to another of desire; till I felt physically hot & ardent, ready to surmount all obstacles. I liked the way the town dropped from the garden leaving us on a triangular island, vegetables one side, grass the other; the path encircling the round house amused me; nor are we overlooked. In short I took it there & then, being egged on by Wycherley’s hesitation, & hints of a purchaser who had already asked for the refusal. Lewes that afternoon, with its many trees & laburnums, & water meadows, & sunny bow windowed houses, & broad High Street looked very tempting & dignified. The end of the story, which I must curtail, is that we have bought the Round House, & are now secure of a lodging on earth so long as we need sleep or sit anywhere."
1919.06.10,"I must use up the fifteen minutes before dinner in going on again, in order to make up the great gap. We are just in from the Club; from ordering a reprint of the Mark on the Wall at the Pelican Press; & from tea with James. His news is that Maynard in disgust at the peace terms has resigned, kicked the dust of office off him, & is now an academic figure at Cambridge. But I must really sing my own praises, since I left off at the point when we came back from Asheham to find the hall table stacked, littered, with orders for Kew Gardens. They strewed the sofa, & we opened them intermittently through dinner, & quarrelled, I’m sorry to say, because we were both excited, & opposite tides of excitement coursed in us, & they were blown to waves by the critical blast of Charleston. All these orders—150 about, from shops & private people—come from a review in the Lit. Sup. presumably by Logan, in which as much praise was allowed me as I like to claim. And 10 days ago I was stoically facing complete failure! The pleasure of success was considerably damaged, first by our quarrel, & second, by the necessity of getting some 90 copies ready, cutting covers, printing tables, glueing backs, & finally despatching, which used up all spare time & some not spare till this moment. But how success showered during those days! Gratuitously, too, I had a letter from Macmillan in New York, so much impressed by The Voyage Out that they want to read Night & Day. I think the nerve of pleasure easily becomes numb. I like little sips; but the psychology of fame is worth considering at leisure. I fancy one’s friends take the bloom off. Lytton lunched here on Saturday with the Webbs, & when I told him my various triumphs, did I imagine a little shade—instantly dispelled, but not before my rosy fruit was out of the sun. Well, I treated his triumphs in much the same way. I can’t feel gratified when he expatiates upon a copy of Eminent Victorians lined & initialled “M” or “H” by Mr & Mrs Asquith. Yet clearly the thought produced a comfortable glow in him. The luncheon was a success. We ate in the garden, & Lytton sported very gracefully & yet with more than his old assurance over the conversation. “But I’m not interested in Ireland—”"
1919.06.14,"The weather seems unbreakable. A delphinium is out today in the garden & one Sweet William; Lottie was discovered brushing the grass with a hearth broom, as though attending to the coat of some pet animal. They say the strawberry crop will be ruined. This is a serious matter for us as we have just bought 60 lbs. of sugar, & had arranged a great jam making. Strawberries are 2/ a lb. at this moment. Asparagus 6d & 7d, & yesterday at Ray’s I ate my first green peas. I had a Hampstead field day; first the Murrys, then Adrian & Karin, & finally dinner—it was 8.30 by the time I got it—with Ray & Dorothy Bussy. A very severe review of Murry, a severe review of Eliot, appeared in the Lit. Sup. on Thursday. Considering their general slackness, I don’t see why they choose to come down so hard upon Murry; & I wish they hadn’t. I attribute the extreme depression of him & Katherine at least partly to this. And I felt gorged & florid with my comparative success. Poor Murry pretended not to mind, but much like a small boy sticking it out that caning doesn’t hurt. A poem is a very sensitive part to be beaten. But Katherine looks so ill & haggard that I suppose health may make a great part of her depression. She is going to San Remo for a year in September. Murry means to live alone in the country. I don’t see how, all this being so, they can look forward to their future. And then there’s the question of Katherine’s writing. Isn’t she a little querulous & restless about that? Standing emphatically yet not quite firmly on her rights as an artist; as people do who must insist upon being one. In token of this she told me a long & to me rather distasteful story about her dealings with a man called Schiff, who wanted her to contribute to art & letters, & dared to offer her advice, upon which she got on her high horse, & wrote him such a letter that he replied humbly—in a style that I couldn’t make anything of, & indeed the rights & wrongs of the whole business escaped me though I protested, I’m ashamed to say, that I share Katherine’s indignation. What a fraud one is in many ways! But then if one’s on this footing of being fellow artists & all that, one’s relations are queered from the start. Anyhow I went off rather sombre, leaving them to their spare lonely meal, nothing seeming to grow or flourish round them; leafless trees."
1919.06.18,"I went off, as I now remember, to call on Adrian, as I was early for Ray; & found that strange couple just decided to become medical students. After 5 years’ training they will, being aged 35 & 41 or so, set up together in practise as psycho-analysts. This is the surface bait that has drawn them. The more profound cause is, I suppose, the old question which used to weigh so heavy on Adrian, what to do? Here is another chance; visions of success & a busy, crowded, interesting life beguile him. Halfway through, I suppose, something will make it all impossible; & then, having forgotten his law, he will take up what—farming or editing a newspaper, or keeping bees perhaps. I don’t see that it matters at all, so long as they always have some carrot dangling in front of them. Dinner with Ray; talk with Dorothy Bussy of her past; promise of her play, & so home with L. who had dined higher up with Margaret. That morning (Friday 13th to be exact) I got the first proofs of my novel. I’ve now had 64 pages.

On Sunday we planned to go to Kew & have tea there, but Logan rang us up, & we came home to see him. More stories, a little less carefully told & so more to my liking; & then we came indoors, & he read us his stories from the bible. At this moment we have the following manuscripts or promises of manuscripts. Paris by Hope Mirrlees. Novel by Altounyan. Stories by Logan. Play by D. Bussy. Ray’s grandmother’s sexual-religious experiences. And old Bob caught Leonard last night at the [Apostles’] dinner & pressed upon him a translation of Lucretius. What steps we’re to take is not at the moment clear to me. Whether to become a shop, or remain a small private press—whether to get help or refuse it. Logan, of course, has a charming young man up his sleeve. How futile these elderly people are! There’s Maurice Baring gone & printed one copy of an anthology at a cost of £40 to give Lady Diana Manners for a present—& she is one of those vaguely literary people who “sometimes read Shakespeare”. Logan approves of this on the whole. He likes to supervise these literary undertakings, & would even give money, but doesn’t want to be disturbed out of his habits. He is printing several anthologies himself in the autumn, “I consider that I’ve done my bit” he said, with a comfortable sigh, after saying that he had been correcting the proofs of these works. He now goes yatchting for a holiday.

Yesterday, Tuesday, I was treated to ices at Gunter’s by Clive. It was all the same as before. Little tables; long rather dark shop; numbers of gilt chairs; discreet buffet; elderly waitresses in black; & couples scattered all about silently, or almost silently, absorbing ices & sugared cakes. There was an aristocratic small boy got up like a picture of Queen Victoria as a child, with a great sash, & a bow, & a hat wreathed in roses. His mother had brought him in, we thought, from one of the great Berkeley Square houses. Then there was youth, by some misadventure not at Ascot; a coffee-coloured young man, & a semi-transparent girl. We strolled out of this solemn cave & sauntered through the purest 18th Century London to the Green Park where we sat on hard green chairs, & watched people passing down the little slope towards the Palace. This being, I suppose, the 6th week without rain the grass is already haycoloured & slippery. We gossiped, speculated, & reminisced. Very easy, agreeable talk to my mind, & then what an age I’ve know⁠[n] him! How much we’ve been through side by side—these infrequent meetings are little islands upon which one stands surveying the flood racing away in the past; looking out over the future, safely & with very little anxiety just at present. He talks of going to Paris in the autumn, to see what’s on; & he’s given up his book, & finds that articles of 2,000 words exactly suit him. He thinks of subjects in his bath. He makes money. He spends it on ices & dinners at the Café Royal. He dines out every night, enjoys every moment, & feels his senses quicker & stronger as time goes on. We agreed in finding life very delightful, though very different for each of us. Home, to await Miss Barbara Lynch, but she never came. The meeting talked to its hearts content. Mrs Whitty & another pressed me for copies of Kew Gardens. But I don’t want them to read the scene of the two women. Is that to the discredit of Kew Gardens? Perhaps a little. I’ve just been there, in the flesh, & sat under a tree, reading The Way of all Flesh, which I have to review tomorrow. According to Fredegond there’s been a crisis between Alix & James. She tried to break with him; failed; went reeling off to Tidmarsh in what state of mind I don’t quite know, & there is at the moment. James inhabits Gordon Sqre—"
1919.06.23,"If I hadn’t had since midday to settle myself, I should still be twanging & twittering with Garsington. But parties don’t fluster me as they used. I dont much care now about the great question of hair, & doing up dresses; I am resigned to my station among the badly dressed, though Gravé [a dressmaker] & her vagaries, & the speeding up of my blue dress, & doubts as to its beauty scarcely seem to confirm that statement. Here, I think, the great & at present sore, question of aesthetic taste enters in. Why am I calm & indifferent as to what people say of Night & Day, & fretful for their good opinion of my blue dress?

However this may be, I enjoyed Garsington saying to myself “The worst moment will be when I come into the drawing room in my blue dress before dinner.” I planned thus to get dressed quick & come in before Ott. which is not difficult as Ott. never gets dressed quick. Mercifully I need not face Garsington squarely & draw its picture. I observed that the sealing wax red drawing room is a good deal smaller this visit than last, & last visit than first. That’s what happens to people too. There was young Lord de la Warr walking among the roses & cabbages, a boy of 19, who after sweeping mines as a seaman is now a socialist, under the guidance of Lansbury. But I took a good look at him & noticed the straightness of his body, ease, & certainty of his manner which mark him out from Gertler quite emphatically. Gertler & Nelson strolled up another garden path. Nelson one of the insignificant, I should say, who has attached himself firmly to the comforts of Garsington. His anxiety to accept an invitation to dinner proved his relish for that one of Ottoline’s bounties. The population was floating & changing. Goldie & I were permanent; Aldous H. came for one night. I shall leave out several names if I try to count them. Young Lord de la Warr said very little; but I think he would have impressed an American, & good manners conciliate me. I think Goldie was the principle element in the week end, that is to say that he took upon him the brunt of Sunday morning, & meal times; 3 hours sitting on a hard seat with Ott. & me, Philip sometimes, Gertler occasionally, & Aldous off & on was a trial; but for us all it was well surmounted. I did not guess the time once. When Philip suggested a visit to the pigs I was ready but not over-ready. I think we discussed Roger most carefully & Forster, & Bob. Ott. needled away at her embroidery, Philip’s bedspread, losing her needle once, & crouching on all fours behind the seat, while Goldie & I went on talking. This seemed to me to typify her modest position; so long as people talk she doesn’t much want to interfere, & she listens, especially if people’s characters are discussed. She had worked off the great Picasso grievance upon Goldie; I had only vague lamentations, & aspirations for my share. Yet it struck me as strange"
1919.07.03,"What struck me as strange? I cant now remember or even guess; perhaps I meant to finish by trying to define the sense of purposelessness which now & then beset me—Suppose we do settle exactly what Roger’s character is, & what degree of spite to allow Clive, & how far Logan has a heart?—well, what then? Are we going nowhere? Does the mist move with us? Well—this is too far gone for recapturing, though there was a queer enough sequel a day or two later at Asheham. We went there on the Thursday following, & came back yesterday. I can’t give much space to Philip’s letter though, seeing how many matters I must despatch; & how, to purify my mind, I must have a brush with the Ajax before L. comes in. Philip’s letter was all about my lack of heart & his terror of me; to which I have rejoined “if I’m Bloomsbury, you’re Mayfair”; to his bewilderment, as I hope. But this is moonshine. The solid fact is that we own, besides the Round House, Monks House at Rodmell, with three quarters of an acre of land. We own Monks House (this is almost the first time I’ve written a name which I hope to write many thousands of times before I’ve done with it) for ever. It happened thus. As we walked up the steep road from the station last Thursday on our way to inspect the Round House, we both read out a placard stuck on the auctioneers wall. Lot 1. Monks House, Rodmell. An old fashioned house standing in three quarters of an acre of land to be sold with possession. The sale we noted was on Tuesday; to take place at the White Hart. “That would have suited us exactly” L. said as we passed, & I, loyal to the Round House, murmured something about the drawbacks of Rodmell, but suggested anyhow a visit to the place; & so we went on. I think a slight shade of anti-climax had succeeded my rather excessive optimism; at any rate the Round House no longer seemed so radiant & unattainable when we examined it as owners. I thought L. a little disappointed, though just & polite even to its merits. The day lacked sun. The bedrooms were very small. The garden not a country garden. Anyhow it seemed well to plan a visit to Rodmell on the following day. I bicycled over against a strong cold wind. This time I flatter myself that I kept my optimism in check. “These rooms are small, I said to myself; you must discount the value of that old chimney piece & the niches for holy water. Monks are nothing out of the way. The kitchen is distinctly bad. Theres an oil stove, & no grate. Nor is there hot water, nor a bath, & as for the E.C. I was never shown it.” These prudent objections kept excitement at bay; yet even they were forced to yield place to a profound pleasure at the size & shape & fertility & wildness of the garden. There seemed an infinity of fruitbearing trees; the plums crow⁠[d]⁠ed so as to weigh the tip of the branch down; unexpected flowers sprouted among cabbages. There were well kept rows of peas, artichokes, potatoes; raspberry bushes had pale little pyramids of fruit; & I could fancy a very pleasant walk in the orchard under the apple trees, with the grey extinguisher of the church steeple pointing my boundary. On the other hand there is little view—O but I’ve forgotten the lawn smoothly rolled, & rising in a bank, sheltered from winds too, a refuge in cold & storm; & a large earthen pot holds sway where the path strikes off, crowned with a tuft of purple samphire. One pot; not two. There is little ceremony or precision at Monks House. It is an unpretending house, long & low, a house of many doors; on one side fronting the street of Rodmell, & wood boarded on that side, though the street of Rodmell is at our end little more than a cart track running out on to the flat of the water meadows. There are, if memory serves me, no less than three large outhouses of different kinds, & a stable; & a hen house—& the machinery of a granary, & one shed full of beams of ancient oak; & another stored with pea props; but our fruit & vegetables are said to flow over each summer into these receptacles, & to need selling; though so obliging in its prolific way as to flourish under the care of a single old man whose heart is of gold, & who, for 40 years I think, has spent his spare time in tending these trees for the late Mr Jacob Verrall—All this made a happy kind of jumble in my brain, together with the store of old fashioned chairs & tables, glass & furniture with which every inch of room space is crowded; I came back & told my story as quietly as I could, & next day L. & I went together & made a thorough inspection. He was pleased beyond his expectation. The truth is he has the making of a fanatical lover of that garden. It suits me very well, too, to ramble off among the Telscombe downs, when fine; or tread out my paces up the path & across the lawn when dark or wind blown. In short, we decided walking home to buy if we could, & sell Round House, as we conjecture we can. Eight hundred we made our limit, which, according to Wycherley, gave us a good chance of possession. The sale was on Tuesday. I don’t suppose many spaces of five minutes in the course of my life have been so close packed with sensation. Was I somehow waiting to hear the result, while I watched the process, of an operation? The room at the White Hart was crowded. I looked at every face, & in particular at every coat & skirt, for signs of opulence, & was cheered to discover none. But then, I thought, getting L. into line, does he look as if he had £800 in his pocket? Some of the substantial farmers might well have their rolls of notes stuffed inside their stockings. Bidding began. Someone offered £300. “Not an offer”, said the auctioneer, who was immediately opposed to us as a smiling courteous antagonist, “a beginning.” The next bid was £400. Then they rose by fifties. Wycherley standing by us, silent & unmoved, added his advance. Six hundred was reached too quick for me. Little hesitations interposed themselves, but went down rather dismally fast. The auctioneer egged us on. I daresay there were six voices speaking, though after £600, 4 of them dropped out, & left only a Mr Tattersall competing with Mr Wycherley. We were allowed to bid in twenties; then tens; then fives; & still short of £700, so that our eventual victory seemed certain. Seven hundred reached, there was a pause; the auctioneer raised his hammer, very slowly; held it up a considerable time; urged & exhorted all the while it slowly sank towards the table. “Now Mr Tattershall, another bid from you—no more bidding once I’ve struck the table—ten pounds? five pounds?—no more? for the last time then—dump!” & down it came on the table, to our thanksgiving—I purple in the cheeks, & L. trembling like a reed—“sold to Mr Wycherley.” We stayed no longer. Out we went into the High Street, & very nearly quarrelled over the address of Roger’s House."
1919.07.08,"We went on, however, L. to Asheham, & I to Charleston, where there was Maynard, & a good deal of brisk talk. He is disillusioned he says. No more does he believe, that is, in the stability of the things he likes. Eton is doomed; the governing classes, perhaps Cambridge too. These conclusions were forced on him by the dismal & degrading spectacle of the Peace Congress, where men played shamelessly, not for Europe, or even England, but for their own return to Parliament at the next election. They were not wholly vicious; they had spasms of well meaning; but a fate seemed to possess the business from the first, driving it all in the most fatal direction & soon no one had the strength to resist. He resigned, & is now a don at Cambridge, daily rejecting profitable offers made him by houses of business, willing, according to Duncan, to pay £4,000 a year for his attendance for a short time daily. We all came up to London early next day, Nessa having to see a Mr Cholmondeley about Julian’s education. We had an afternoon’s gaiety at the Ballet, & then went back to Gordon Sqre, everything a little glittering & unreal, as usual after the country & in Nessa’s presence.

Friday, the 4th, I went to tea with Katherine, since I begin to feel my visits numbered, how seriously I dont know, but once she gets abroad, what’s to bring her back? Murry, poor man, pale & sad as usual, for she is again only just out of bed. The weather of course is taking its revenge now for a season of generosity. We have fires every night. Worse than the cold is the drab coloured sky, so that one’s whole existence seems to be in the shadow.

On Saturday we saw the horse show, & I had a look at Queen Alexandra’s poor old effigy, still painted like a wildrose, though she is about 75, & can only hobble up a ladder like a decrepit washerwoman. Its only on the face that the pretence can be preserved.

On Sunday Mrs Hamilton brought her sister—“the poet”—to dinner. I almost laughed at the sight of her. She stumps, peering & hesitating, into a room, shakes hands with emphasis, & displays a small round pale face, with wisps of brown hair controlled by a tight band of ribbon. A mixture of schoolgirl & German professor to look at; awkward & restless in manner; & delivering herself of rounded periods which would be queer enough in themselves were they not delivered with the oddest rotundity of diction, as of one speaking from a tub,—& in a voice that swells & falls but finally swells like a musical instrument imperfectly controlled. In spite of these curiosities of manner & appearance she seemed perfectly self possessed, & referred to her stock of book learning, which seemed very large & various, with the greatest composure. “As Nietchze says” or, “To quote Dostoevsky”, or “In the opinion of the Neo-Cartesians.”—Such were her conversational openings, waiting no season but obtruding themselves spontaneously. “I do not myself feel any doubt as to the nature of the good, nor have I indeed ever felt any doubt upon that point”—this was fired off when the talk was not concerned with anything of the kind. Yet one couldn’t dislike her, or dub her a very poisonous variety of the prig. I suppose her to be the family prodigy, fed on books, & living up to now in a dark cave until like a creature deprived of light the complexion of her soul is entirely white. She has the mind of an albino. What is to become of her? I don’t suspect her a poet. I imagine her one of those prodigies who quite contentedly continue all their lives, in some country village, to absorb learning, & have their circle of correspondents. Her letters must be portentous. Molly watched her with the oddest mixture of pride & uneasiness. What were we thinking of her? Did we realise that these manners & views were only superficial; did we not see how remarkable a product she was—could we not perhaps be made, by artful questions & hints, to see it? Margot is now reading—on Comparative Religions. Margot spent all her life pretending she was a Monk or Rob Roy. We now hesitate whether or not to ask to read her poems."
1919.07.10,"I have forgotten several people, I see. One is Arundell del Ré, Logan’s prize young man, devoted to the cause of good books, & proposing to start a shop in Chelsea for the promotion of them. He intends not only selling on a select principle, but binding, & printing, & providing a room where book lovers can love books. His weakness & paleness did not impress us; but then, perhaps weakness and paleness are the necessary qualities. At a pinch too, I think, like most men, he has business qualities, & brains enough to be dependable. His most serious contribution to an evening of vague discussion was that he should relieve us of all the business of the Hogarth Press, stock our books, keep our accounts, in return for which we’re to give him a few lessons in printing. I suppose something may come of it.

Last night I dined at the Savoy Grill Room with Clive. It is long since eating a meal was such a serious business to me—long since I had taken part in the great ceremony of dinner with others believing in it, assisting at it, & dressing for it. Fish & meat & melon & ices have come to their own again. Clive parted with a good deal of paper money. His appearance never, even now, is altogether smart or wordly; his shoulders are not broad enough, & then his hair—But he was dressed, carried a black cane, & wore a silk hat. Oddly enough my mind went back to my first sight of him years ago. He looked young & had the unselfassured manner of one not used to things, only pretending use. This ceremony of eating takes so long that it was 9 by the time we finished, & the light through the enormous window dusky & almost lamplit. He pointed out to me Picasso & Mdme Picasso making off for the ballet; & behind us sat the little ivory figure of Lopokhova’s husband. Thus there was every reason for Clive to feel assured. We drove back to Gordon Square & talked about the problems of literature. On his table lay his ‘puff’ of me in the New Republic; I daresay I should have preferred not to be bracketed with Eliot & Murry. I wonder if I talk nonsense about writing to Clive? On the whole I believe that he has an odd gift for making one talk sense. He’s so eager that one should talk sense; his enthusiasm is the engaging thing about him—deducting the tribute of his enthusiasm for me. Moreover, whatever one may think of his taste in life, however one may feel him a little battered & dusty in the pursuit of pleasure, still there’s his honesty; his vivacity; his determination not to be bored, & not to bore. In his own way he is somehow a figure."
1919.07.12,"In public affairs, I see I’ve forgotten to say that peace was signed; perhaps that ceremony was accomplished while we were at Asheham. I’ve forgotten the account I was going to write out of the gradual disappearance of things from shop windows; & the gradual, but still only partial reappearance of things. Sugar cakes, currant buns, & mounds of sweets. The effect of the war would be worth describing, & one of these days at Monks House—but why do I let myself imagine spaces of leisure at Monks House? I know I shall have books that must be read there too, just as here & now I should be reading Herman Melville, & Thomas Hardy, not to say Sophocles, if I’m to finish the Ajax, as I wager myself to do, before August. But this dressing up of the future is one of the chief sources of our happiness, I believe. There’s still a good deal of the immediate past asserting its claim on me. I met Morgan Forster on the platform at Waterloo yesterday; a man physically resembling a blue butterfly—I mean by that to describe his transparency & lightness. He had been conveying the luggage of 5 Indians from Deptford to Waterloo; Indians seemed to weigh him down. We exchanged compliments on our writing—I’m surprised to find him openly liking a compliment, though its nothing strange in myself; & discussed Altounyan’s work a little. He did not at all care for it; no form, no character; no one figure dominating the others. I like Forster very much, though I find him whimsical & vagulous to an extent that frightens me with my own clumsiness & definiteness. Then I bought my bag of coffee, & so up to Katherine, with whom I spent my hour very happily. Indeed, I like her more & more; & think we have reached some kind of durable foundation. Home to a dinner party consisting of the two Altounyans, Ernest & Norah, Carrington (the male), & Herbert Woolf after dinner. Poor scatterbrained A. showed the least pleasant side of himself in discussing his novel, which he does not merely with passion but with a conceit that would be irritating if it weren’t transparently foolish. His only anxiety is to find how many people are capable of understanding him; about the merits of his work he has no doubt, & cut short my laborious critical survey of them. Rather coolly, he proposed that we should be his agents, finding publishers for all his works for ever. This is all rather foreign; as I found it foreign, though pleasantly foreign of him, to tell me how many people had wished to marry his sister—“For she wishes very much to be married.” “Yes” she said simply, “if one hasn’t a profession, one must marry; one must look after someone.” I liked her better than I like him. As for Carrington, he will be a very popular man in the East."
1919.07.19,"One ought to say something about Peace day, I suppose, though whether its worth taking a new nib for that purpose I dont know. I’m sitting wedged into the window, & so catch almost on my head the steady drip of rain which is pattering on the leaves. In ten minutes or so the Richmond procession begins. I fear there will be few people to applaud the town councillors dressed up to look dignified & march through the streets. I’ve a sense of holland covers on the chairs; of being left behind when everyone’s in the country. I’m desolate, dusty, & disillusioned. Of course we did not see the procession. We have only marked the rim of refuse on the outskirts. Rain held off till some half hour ago. The servants had a triumphant morning. They stood on Vauxhall Bridge & saw everything. Generals & soldiers & tanks & nurses & bands took 2 hours in passing. It was they said the most splendid sight of their lives. Together with the Zeppelin raid it will play a great part in the history of the Boxall family. But I don’t know—it seems to me a servants festival; some thing got up to pacify & placate ‘the people’—& now the rain’s spoiling it; & perhaps some extra treat will have to be devised for them. Thats the reason of my disillusionment I think. There’s something calculated & politic & insincere about these peace rejoicings. Moreover they are carried out with no beauty, & not much spontaneity. Flags are intermittent; we have what the servants, out of snobbishness, I think, insisted upon buying, to surprise us. Yesterday in London the usual sticky stodgy conglomerations of people, sleepy & torpid as a cluster of drenched bees, were crawling over Trafalgar Square, & rocking about the pavements in the neighbourhood. The one pleasant sight I saw was due rather to the little breath of wind than to decorative skill; some long tongue shaped streamers attached to the top of the Nelson column licked the air, furled & unfurled, like the gigantic tongues of dragons, with a slow, rather serpentine beauty. Otherwise theatres & music halls were studded with stout glass pincushions which, rather prematurely, were all radiant within—but surely light might have shone to better advantage. However night was sultry & magnificent so far as that went, & we were kept awake some time after getting into bed by the explosion of rockets which for a second made our room bright. (And now, in the rain, under a grey brown sky, the bells of Richmond [are] ringing—but church bells only recall weddings & Christian services.) I can’t deny that I feel a little mean at writing so lugubriously; since we’re all supposed to keep up the belief that we’re glad & enjoying ourselves. So on a birthday, when for some reason things have gone wrong, it was a point of honour in the nursery to pretend. Years later one could confess what a horrid fraud it seemed; & if, years later, these docile herds will own up that they too saw through it, & will have no more of it—well—should I be more cheerful? I think the dinner at the 1917 Club, & Mrs Besant’s speech rubbed the gilt, if there were any grains remaining, effectually off the gingerbread. Hobson was sardonic. She—a massive, & sulky featured old lady, with a capacious head, however, thickly covered with curly white hair,—began by comparing London, lit up & festive, with Lahore. And then she pitched into us for our maltreatment of India, she, apparently, being ‘them’ & not ‘us’. But I don’t think she made her case very solid, though superficially it was all believable, & the 1917 Club applauded & agreed. I cant help listening to speaking as though it were writing, & thus the flowers, which she brandished now & again, looked terribly artificial. It seems to me more & more clear that the only honest people are the artists, & that these social reformers & philanthropists get so out of hand, & harbour so many discreditable desires under the disguise of loving their kind, that in the end there’s more to find fault with in them than in us. But if I were one of them?"
1919.07.20,"Perhaps I will finish the account of the peace celebrations. What herd animals we are after all!—even the most disillusioned. At any rate, after sitting through the procession & the peace bells unmoved, I began after dinner, to feel that if something was going on, perhaps one had better be in it. I routed up poor L. & threw away my Walpole. First lighting a row of glass lamps, & seeing that the rain was stopped, we went out just before ten. Explosions had for some time promised fireworks. The doors of the public house at the corner were open, & the room crowded; couples walzing; songs being shouted, waveringly, as if one must be drunk to sing. A troop of little boys with lanterns were parading the Green, beating sticks. Not many shops went to the expense of electric light. A woman of the upper classes was supported dead drunk between two men partially drunk. We followed a moderate stream flowing up the Hill. Illuminations were almost extinct half way up, but we kept on till we reached the terrace. And then we did see something—not much indeed, for the damp had deadened the chemicals. Red & green & yellow & blue balls rose slowly into the air, burst, flowered into an oval of light, which dropped in minute grains & expired. There were hazes of light at different points. Rising over the Thames, among trees, these rockets were beautiful; the light on the faces of the crowd was strange; yet of course there was grey mist muffling everything, & taking the blaze off the fire. It was a melancholy thing to see the incurable soldiers lying bed at the Star & Garter with their backs to us, smoking cigarettes, & waiting for the noise to be over. We were children to be amused. So at eleven we went home, & saw from my study Ealing do its best to rejoice, & indeed one fire balloon went so high that L. believed it a star; but there were none showing. Today the rain has left us in no doubt that any remaining festivities are to be completely quenched."
1919.07.24,"Well, the peace at any rate is over; though the poor deluded servants are spending their day out on a bus to see the decorations. I was right: it is a servants peace. Last night we had Forster & the Bussys. It was not the mixture we should have chosen, since Forster would come out better alone. However, such are the penalties of owning a press. I feel something like Horace Walpole who had to limit the visitors to Strawberry Hill to 4 daily—Morgan is easily drowned even by the vivacity of the Bussys. He is an unwordly, transparent character, whimsical & detached, caring very little I should think what people say, & with a clear idea of what he wishes. I dont think he wishes to shine in intellectual society; certainly not in fashionable. He is fantastic & very sensitive; an attractive character to me, though from his very qualities it takes as long to know him as it used to take to put one’s gallipot over a humming bird moth. More truly, he resembles a vaguely rambling butterfly; since there is no intensity or rapidity about him. To dominate the talk would be odious to him. He subsided in a chair; or strolled about the room, turning over the pages of a book. Even when the B’s had gone, we made little direct headway. He will come to Asheham if we pay his fare. He has only £26 in the bank. I liked this simple way of explaining things. And he hates Stevenson; & makes up his novels as he goes along; & sees what I mean about dialogue; there’s a lot to say to him, though I don’t yet know how to say it. Its absurd at my age, & I feel very middle aged, to be as easily put out & flustered as I am. It takes the form of saying things rashly. “I want to write an article upon you” I said, & that wasn’t what I meant to say."
1919.09.07,"I suppose this is the first day upon which I could easily sit down & write in my long suffering & by this time I hope tolerant diary. The lack of table, pen, paper, & ink or rather their dispersion into separate parts of the house was one reason; & then followed domestic crises which I had foretold, but that did not improve their quality when they came. Now the servants are at Charleston, Mr Dedman & his brother are naming apple trees in the orchard to Leonard & if I can resist getting up & joining them I may fill this page.

The move was accomplished in one day, thanks chiefly to the organisation of L. who tied all the books in lots. Two waggon loads, one leaving about ten, another at six did the job, & we managed to roost about the house somehow or other that night. Next morning those troubles began which I will not specify further; then L. had a night in London, & I, sitting down to my book in the dusk, heard a voice asking for me, & then, to my dismay, saw the lean fantatical figure of Altounyan cross the window. He had his wife & friend—Montana or Fontana—outside, & I had to produce ham & coffee for them & entertain my first visitors. A. had come from London on purpose to see us; on purpose, I rather think, to discuss the eternal novel once more, & perhaps contrive to get it issued by us. Mrs Hamilton has read, & found it necessary to quote King Lear. Part of this terrific egotism may be attributed to the Armenian half of him, I think; it is not offensive; but would become intensely boring. But, unhappily, people who come all the way from London & walk 10 miles for the chance of seeing one are almost always bores. I set them on their road about ten o’clock, & could not resist a dark stroll in the garden. The temptation whispers from the window all the time—so pleasant to step out onto the lawn, walk across to the tool house, & survey the downs in day time or the lights of Lewes by night. Much remains to be done inside the house, though the main arrangements are now made. But for some days one’s mind is distracted by perpetually dwelling upon the changes round one; it works with an effort. This is wearing off slightly, though I write this as if I were raising 7 stone on my pen instead of the usual number of ounces. However from all the difficulties, advantages & disadvantages of the place, I think the upshot is wholly favourable. One gains much in the way of variety here; there are more walks, & endless interests in the garden, though nothing of the flawless beauty of Asheham."
1919.09.12,"The weight upon my mind is lessening, though, as I have not yet mastered a writing board, the long leisurely filling of these blank pages which I promised myself becomes something of a mirage. But then Duncan & Nessa have just been over unexpectedly to tea. Other peoples incursions always leave me tremulous. They break in upon a mood of depression, deep according to L.; to me of the consistency of September mist. Why is it, I wonder? Partly that for 10 days I don’t think I’ve had a letter; then I expect something unpleasant from Macmillans. Here I make my forecast. “We have read Night & Day with the deepest interest, but hardly think it would appeal to our public over here.” Though I foretell this, & see that written down it is negligible as criticism, yet I want to have that unpleasant moment over. It will infect me for a few days. And the publication of N. & D. may perhaps send an occasional tremor through me for all my boasting. If that is pronounced a failure, I dont see why I should continue writing novels. These are the usual writers melancholies. On top of them, there’s been the move, the comparison of this place with Asheham, servants—& so on. Writing has been done under difficulties. I was making way with my new experiment, when I came up against Sir Thomas Browne, & found I hadn’t read him since I used to dip & duck & be bored & somewhow enchanted hundreds of years ago. Therefore I had to break off, send for his books (by the way, I have read him fairly often, now I come to think of it) & start little stories. These are always ticklish; a bad morning reduces one to melancholy. But since I began to write this, I’ve suffered so many interruptions, that my mood is no longer benignant. I think I shall yield to temptation & see what the sun is doing over the meadows. O the thousand appliances one needs for writing even a sentence! No books from The Times either, & as for writing a letter, I cant bring myself to break the virginity of a sheet of paper."
1919.09.13,"Well, Macmillan’s letter came this morning, & is neither so good nor so bad as it might have been. They read with great interest, think N. & D. a fine work, but not likely to appeal to a wide public in America, & too long to be, at this season, worth reprinting. But they propose to take 500 or 1000 sheets from Gerald; the same number of The Voyage Out, & understand that I will offer them my next book. On the whole, I’m rather pleased than otherwise. The Voyage Out will be exhausted; certainly this is the only method of becoming known to America, & presumably Macmillans think me worth keeping in view. Heaven knows when my next novel will be ready! The same post brought their refusal of Le’s book, they will take sheets of that too. It don’t much matter. I shall accept, I suppose, since there’s scarcely time to try elsewhere. But I dont think Macmillan had much to do with my depression. Do I envy Nessa her overflowing household? Perhaps at moments. Julian has gone into a preparatory form of breeches; everything flourishing & humane there; perhaps I can’t help a contrast which never occurs when I’m in full flood of work. I made these comparisons yesterday, when I lunched there & spent the afternoon & rode home. By the way, I’m an ingrate to nourish the least private cloud in the face of such brightness of sky. The downs all black against scarlet & gold, as I rode home, stopping to look at Asheham, which had its windows open as if lived in. Mr Geal was going up to pick apples. But Monk’s House gives one a pleasant little shock as one opens the gate. I found L. & Nelly just back from Lewes with her new bicycle. He had spent the day in London. Seven has struck & I’m tempted to walk upon the flats. I had meant to say something about these queer spiritual states. They interest me, even when I’m the subject. And I always remember the saying that at one’s lowest ebb one is nearest a true vision. I think perhaps 9 people out of ten never get a day in the year of such happiness as I have almost constantly; now I’m having a turn of their lot.
"
1919.09.14,"Well, I dont think my turn of their lot is a very serious matter. The interesting thing is that one does, normally, keep up a kind of vibration, for no reason whatever. Equally for no reason whatever, the vibration stops. Then one enquires why one ever had it, & there seems no reason why one should ever have it again. Things seem clear, sane, comprehensible, & under no obligation, being of that nature, to make one vibrate at all. Indeed, its largely the clearness of sight which comes at such seasons that leads to depression. But when one can analyse it, one is half way back again. I feel unreason slowly tingling in my veins. If I could have a good morning’s work! We went for our first Sunday walk today. In order to counteract the tremendous draw of the garden we have arranged two walks a week, on Sundays & Wednesdays. Today we went on the downs towards Kingston. For the first of many days it was cloudy; a north east wind, a threatening of rain. We saw the sea at Brighton & the sea at Eastbourne to right & left of us. The valley slopes behind the down are very lovely; the down itself rising to some height, but intersected by railings. I think the views are finer this side than the other, though the downs themselves inferior. I must try a little Plato now—to prove that concentration is as easy here as elsewhere."
1919.09.21,"Why should I pick out the one hour of the week when Church bells jangle to go on with this? A cold bright Sunday; very easy today to remember the feel of winter,—even the look of the winter earth. Yesterday, as I sat reading, Nick came knocking at the door. I had put away his letter unanswered, also, apparently, unread. We had to make ready a room, & prepare a crab, which he brought as offering. He seemed singularly featureless, rather like those chubby little village boys one sees with rosy cheeks & red ears staring in at sweet shop windows. This is I think much his real character, but superimposed is a dab of culture, taking the safe direction of 18th century literature & art. “Thomas Gray knew how to write letters from the country—very witty interesting letters—Have you ever read Thomas Gray?” Then Jane Austen appears. She is his great fan. As for apples & pears, which are now his business, his knowledge is limited; or perhaps it is due to his thin soiled brain that words are very poverty sticken, ideas seem to crawl. Looking up, I saw his face alongside L.’s; & they looked samples of different breeds, or widely spaced stages of development. “Here, the professor might say, pointing his stick at Nick, is a type of primitive man—man yet incapable of concentration or foresight—” Whereas here—well, his remarks upon L. would be highly complimentary. In spite of this grudging scrape of my pen, I liked Nick quite enough to enjoy seeing him; & having a practical, & perhaps, trained mind, we pumped him a good deal about the house. He cannot see a cupboard without discovering how it has been built in, or a pipe without running his finger along, or a brick without lifting it to pry⁠[?] out possible secrets of building. He advises as to ask Hope’s advice. Barbara arrived for lunch, in breeches & jersey, scarlet as an apple but maternal, to my eye, & with her vivid little edge of character distinguishing her from the rest of them. She is considerably more distinguished than Nick, & he recognises this abundantly. Perhaps his pride is blown upon by the covetous eyes of Saxon. Anyhow, he thinks B. a most remarkable character, stamped with the precious mark of Gordon Square’s approval. O dear—when will that mark be rubbed out? Yet it’s vain talking. What would it profit me to gain the praise of the whole world & lose that single voice? This reflection is due in part to the Memoirs of Mrs Humphry Ward. By paying 5/ I have become a member of the Lewes public library. It is an amusing place—full of old ghosts; books half way to decomposition. A general brownness covers them. They are as much alike outwardly as charity schoolchildren. Most have shed their boards years ago, & been recovered in brown paper. There is no reason, either, why Mungo Park should not be succeeded by the Sermons of Ebenezer Howard, & then Lord Morley’s Recollections, & then White Wings, or a Swallow’s Summer, & then Treasures of the Deep. Thats the sort of thing anyhow I could not resist Mrs Ward, & I stand in her unconscionably long hours, as if she were a bath of tepid water that one lacks the courage to leave. But she set me thinking after tea about fame. No one has had a deeper draught of it. The poor woman, now conscious of a little chill, brings out her old praises & hangs them out of her front windows. “See what Henry James said of me—Walter Pater—George Meredith.” And indeed these poor old grandees, solicited I suppose by presentation copies & the rest, do seem to have perjured themselves cheerfully, though I can see them winking. My point is however, that all this blare & pomp has no kind of effect upon the sensitive reader, as I claim to be. Perhaps the winks are too evident. The enormous sales, the American editions, the rumble & reverberation—Piccadilly placarded with posters ‘Marcella out!’—seem like the drum & cymbals of a country fair. No, nothing of this counts—She herself, setting out to write an intimate account of feelings & thoughts, gives nothing but bills of fare & pass books. At what point did she cease thinking? Long Long ago, I should say; & then came to believe implicitly in the mummery: names of the great serve as umbrellas covering vacancy. But all tea table talk to admonish the young, who are, I suppose, now becoming inquisitive & objectionable. What a picture though of the highest life in intellectual circles in London! What a portrait of the Servants Hall; with Mrs H. W. for housekeeper, & Uncle Matt, the master. A Detestable assembly, as she paints it. Literature served up on plate before them. I have Gosse to review, which makes me rig up some fancy scene as I stumble about the fields. To Rat Farm with L. this afternoon; & found a hawk moth drowned in the brook—privet? or what?"
1919.09.28,"Cut off as we are from all human intercourse (unless you count the Dedmans) I cannot be sure even of the date. It is said that the entire railways of England are on strike; the miners, & perhaps the transport workers, are with them. This happened yesterday morning, or rather late the night before; & though we got our papers through late in the evening, we are without posts. The signalman [Tom Pargiter] gave us some information yesterday, & believes himself to be striking against a reduction of 14/ a week in his wages. His strike pay comes to 16/ a week. How with prices what they are the strike can be kept up more than a day or two it is difficult to see. He expects a settlement tomorrow; but as he hopes it, one can’t trust him, & like all the rest, he knows far less about the reasons & machinations than we do—L. at any rate. At present, what with Sunday & the quiet one imagines on the lines, a queer deep silence seems to lie upon us. We post letters knowing they wont get further than Lewes. There is talk of a motor car service. The Government make a show of courageous determination. We are on war rations, & told to be brave & good. Not since coaching days has the village of Rodmell been so isolated as it is at the present moment. Yet a state of siege has a certain snugness & self sufficiency about it. No one can interrupt. I have given myself a respite from Hope Mirrlees, whose review ought to have been dispatched this morning. If it lasts another day or two the food difficulty will begin. Then there’s the question of getting back on Thursday.

Until this strike came our main concern has been L.’s arm. A week ago, or last Monday his wrist & arm broke into a rash. The Dr called it eczema. Then Mrs Dedman brushed this aside & diagnosed sunflower poisoning. L. had been uprooting them with bare hands. We have accepted her judgment, which is confirmed by the case of Mrs Wooler’s brother, but that doesn’t do away with the fact that its a vile & irritating disease. Today for the first time the swelling is less, & the rash improved. But the week has been much damaged in consequence. Yesterday we went over to Asheham, plundered the hollow of its mushrooms, & then got in at the drawing room window. Gunn is spending £60 on turning it into a rose pink boudoir—that colour at least predominates. But they have evidently taken a book of patterns & marked out the most respectable bright colours, so that the rooms are all as smooth & impeccable & glossy as can be. There are mustard yellows & pillar box reds. Of course, I couldn’t approve, but I should have liked it still less if he had chosen after my own taste, & the house had looked as dim & mysterious as ever. I dont know whether its one’s accommodating temper that painted the place a little shut in & dismal, with the vast hollow behind & the straight view between trees in front. I thought it lacking in variety, this time, & colour—but I expect this is one of the devices of the imagination. Anyhow Monk’s improves, after the fashion of a mongrel who wins your heart. I should have said a good deal about the garden only the temptation of being there instead of describing it from within has been too much even for my confirmed habits. The green of the turf with the bunch of purple Japanese anemones keeps getting in my eyes. We have been planting tiny grains of seed in the front bed, in the pious or religious belief that they will resurrect next spring as Clarkia, Calceolaria, Campanula, Larkspur & Scabious. I shan’t recognise them if they do; we are planting at a venture, inspired by seedsmen’s language: how they stand high & bear bright blue petals. Then there’s weeding. Very soon, in any occupation, one makes a game of it. I mean (for I’m cold & inept at the moment—church bells ringing, fire just catching, & the great log we sawed about to plunge into fiery caverns) that one gives characters to weeds. The worst is the fine grass which has to be sifted out conscientiously. I like uprooting thick dandelions & groundsel. Then the tea bell rings, & though I sit & ponder over my cigarette, L. runs out like a child allowed to get down & go. And as I say, today we’re on our island, which will be boarded tomorrow, oddly enough, by Clive.

I’ve reviewed Hope; Gosse & Swinnerton, all in the past 10 days so that the great autumn downpour is beginning. It crosses my mind now & then that Night & Day will be one drop of it: but that seems to belong to London—not here. The bore will be meeting people, who think they must say that they have not read it; perhaps worse, that they have. That will last six weeks; then no more."
1919.09.30,"This is opened to record the Strike bulletin. Nothing has happened. All railways are silent. I went into Lewes yesterday, & found a kind of modified Sunday prevailing; shutters half closed at post & railway station. There were numbers of motors with luggage & the pampered rich. Rumour—shop keepers, that is to say,—predicts a long strike. Who’s in the right, they dont say: ‘anyhow its bad for us’. In our private world the discomfort is mostly what we imagine for the future. We can make no plans anyhow. Last night Clive did not come, & thinking this implied disaster to N. in London, I telegraphed first thing this morning; no answer yet, & its struck seven. The papers are just in, shrunk to single sheets, & untrustworthy in their extreme—Daily Mail & Herald; truthful in the middle perhaps, Daily News. So far nothing but persistent hostility on both sides; no overtures. To increase our private sense of the ominous, Mr Dean chose this day to move the cupboards. The house is therefore scattered with books & furniture, but we gain a dining room. To appease us, the weather stays fine as possible, clear, cold, still, & sunny. Clive stayed at Charleston nursing a cold. No letters since Saturday morning, save his card, which is local. We shall be without butter, coffee, & cigarettes in a day or two, getting them from London."
1919.10.01,"The strike remains, so far as we can judge, the same. On the other hand, rumours of the strike change from hour to hour. A post came this morning. The postman is reported to say that all trains are running as usual. The signalman appears. Situation unchanged; much depressed. Then Dedman comes to pick apples. A notice is in the post office, he says, that trains are as usual. Nelly goes to Lewes. Comes back ‘frightened’ so she says. A few trains only, into which you get at your own risk. This sickened her of travel, which she had been urging an hour before. We went down to the signalman with books & offers of help. His wife met us; he being at Newhaven. A fiery, impulsive, vigorous woman about to bear her 5th child. She was urging him to give in. Public opinion was against them, she said. Then she explained that they had only saved 6 shillings. With their strike pay this can’t long keep off hunger. Then she couldn’t see the rights of it, “They’re like children who’ve had their sweet & dont want to give up their penny” she said, often enough to show that she’d used the argument often to him. They must give it up sooner or later, so why not now."
1919.10.07,"Home yesterday. The ‘docile herds’ whom I describe on Peace day are not so deluded after all. They have held the country up for eleven days, I think. We did a little to support them too, & kept one man on strike who would have gone back without our pound. Still, what’s to be read in the papers is hardly fit for my private page. I wonder if I could expound the railway strike? What they asked, & what they got? At any rate the strike broke in to our life more than the war did—but I’ve written my diary, intermittently, & have it at Rodmell. There’s a private strike to record too. I should like to write philosophically & analyse what is no doubt a sign—dont they call it?—of the times. We must think out our position. The question is, are we to fling off in a new direction? What do we want? Now at our age, where youth is not quite over, & discretion is fully blown, but not long seated—its not so easy to know what one does 9th Oct want, I meant to add, but that reflection’s two days old. Dear old Nelly came in shyly like a school girl & asked to apologise last night; & I see us settled for life, with Hogarth, Monk’s House, & two domestics.

I have no time to fill this page, since I must read my review book, (Landor), read Logan’s stories, write a letter or two, & I’ve let the time since tea slip. I began reading the first volume of my diary; & see that its second anniversary is now reached. I dont think the first volume makes such good reading as the last; a proof that all writing, even this unpremeditated scribbling, has its form, which one learns. Is it worth going on with? The trouble is, that if one goes on a year or so more, one will feel bound on that account to continue. I wonder why I do it. Partly, I think, from my old sense of the race of time ‘Time’s winged chariot hurrying near’—Does it stay it?"
1919.10.11,"Things are once more in swing, though in rather a modified form for me, since I’ve promised to be careful, which means avoiding the temptation of London, & walking down the sunny drives at Kew. In spite of cold, the sun is still the sun of holiday & country, somehow unfit for the pavement slabs. A record autumn for fineness, I should think, always falsifying the predictions of the Times prophet, who is gloomy. For the first time I went up to London yesterday in the first place to buy gloves; in the second to have tea at Nessa’s flat [36 Regent Square], A comfortable party there, seated on the kitchen floor. Julian in a Norfolk jacket & Eton collar looking a responsible Briton; Quentin still amorphous. The dim & dusky flat of James’s day is now at the very opposite pole of culture—the pole of sun & brightness. The rooms overflow with children. The books are the incongruous part of the decoration, & Nessa professed great contempt for them. “Of course, she said, there’s Shakespeare & all that on the bottom shelf, but look at that! Doesn’t that give James away?” He has all the right books, neatly ranged, but not interesting in the least—not, I mean, all lusty & queer like a writers books. The Stracheys with the exception of Lytton are down in the world. Lytton we ran into at the Club on coming back—composed, agreeable, permanently shone upon, & completely sure of himself—ah, but infinitely charming into the bargain. Success, I believe, produces a kind of modesty. It frees you from bothering about yourself. He was flattering to me, as usual; but then I’m not a success. Did I not hear from Macmillan today that Messrs Duckworth’s charges are prohibitive? So my chance of appearing in America is gone. But I’m showered under with review books; &, though I dont suppose I can pretend that any saying by a publisher is a rebuff, still I’m conscious of being almost proof—against Gordon Square? I wonder. Yes, I believe that my well of confidence, or rather pleasure, is so deep sunk as to bubble up in a day or two after any chastening. But this I shall soon be able to test. My review, laboured & well meaning as it was, of Hope’s book has so far drawn no letter of thanks from her. I’m not sure that she didn’t cherish some boundless dream about it. A whole column, in the middle, comparing her with the greatest only. Well, I’ve had my dreams too. At the same time I’m generally rather surprised by the goodness of reality."
1919.10.19,"A gap of more than a week. Let me see how my hours after tea have been occupied. The Waterlows came last Sunday; on Monday I went up, had my tea at the Club, & met for a second, Molly Hamilton “And when’s your novel coming out?”; Tuesday I had to read through 2 volumes of an American scribbler sent me by Murry; Wednesday was crammed with George Eliot, I expect, since Logan & Clive came at 7.30; Thursday I rejoiced in Saxon & Barbara; Friday I had tea with Nessa, & supper too, & went to a Promenade; Saturday I heard L. say his lecture, & then had poor little Dorothy Hornett up to give her her sweets; so here I am with a clear conscience at Sunday, over my fire, waiting for L. to come in from Sutton. Clearly I cant go through the list. That is an unreasonable demand. Sydney Waterlow is very well pleased with himself. Yet as his talk becomes more & more complacent, his prospects more & more blooming, I always fancy that I can see a slight wobble in what should be the perfect sphere, like that which used to foretell the collapse of an air ball. He has great designs upon the F.O. nothing less than complete reformation; but if these miscarry he will accept £10,000 a year in the city. But the preposterous man has his endearing absurdity. A third project of his is to settle at Oare & write books in collaboration with Desmond. For ever he clings to the skirts of the Desmonds & Leonards & even Virginias (I’m much admired, momentarily) as if not wholly secure even now. She, Dawks, was squat & vivacious as usual. Some of her intelligent remarks fell flat though—those supposing a knowledge of Sydney’s work. He is respectful to her in her own department, & feels that her capacity there is a tribute to him. Saxon & Barbara don’t need much licking into shape: he on the sprightly side, she maternal & boyish, a little to my irritation. After all, few people dont act a part of some kind. Logan was rather more aloof & distinguished than my memory of him. Perhaps he disapproved a little of Clive. Clive certainly intended that he should. He described his entire indolence; & then his pleasures: “We dine not very well, & then slip into bed together.” “Goodness no—I dont read on a system—Goodness gracious, I dont write every day.”—so on. Now Logan’s epicurean life is well regulated; self improvement is not despicable in his eyes; his conversation is decorous. We got out 12 volumes of Gibbon, & they capped passages. We have undertaken to get Logan’s stories printed."
1919.10.21,"This is Trafalgar day, & yesterday is memorable for the appearance of Night & Day. My six copies reached me in the morning, & five were despatched, so that I figure the beaks of five friends already imbedded. Am I nervous? Oddly little; more excited & pleased than nervous. In the first place, there it is, out & done with; then I read a bit & liked it; then I have a kind of confidence, that the people whose judgment I value will probably think well of it, which is much reinforced by the knowledge that even if they dont, I shall pick up & start another story on my own. Of course, if Morgan & Lytton & the others should be enthusiastic, I should think the better of myself. The bore is meeting people who say the usual things. But on the whole, I see what I’m aiming at; what I feel is that this time I’ve had a fair chance & done my best; so that I can be philosophic & lay the blame on God. Lovely autumn days come one after another; the leaves hanging like rare gold coins on the trees. Clive was at the Club yesterday, & talked ostensibly to me, but to the whole room in reality some of whom judged him a little bounder, I suppose, & turned round & thanked God when he left the room.

O yes, I should like a good long review in the Times."
1919.10.23,"The first fruits of Night & Day must be entered “No doubt a work of the highest genius” Clive Bell. Well, he might not have liked it; he was critical of The Voyage Out. I own I’m pleased; yet not convinced that it is as he says. However, this is a token that I’m right to have no fears. The people whose judgment I respect won’t be so enthusiastic as he is, but they’ll come out decidedly on that side, I think. Moreover, in a way which I can’t defend to L., I do respect Clive’s judgment. It’s erratic, but always springs from a direct feeling. I think I feel most doubtful about Morgan; after getting his report I shall be quite at ease. Three or four people count, & the rest, save as a senseless clapping of hands or hissing, are nowhere. No one of much intelligence, outside my own friends, is likely to read a very long novel. But I must stop; I’m at my hack work, & Ka dines here, & I can’t spare time to describe my concert last night. Only room for my own praises. Besides, I must thank C."
1919.10.30,"I have the excuse of rheumatism for not writing more; & my hand tired of writing, apart from rheumatism. Still, if I could treat myself professionally as a subject for analysis I could make an interesting story of the past few days, of my vicissitudes about N. & D. After Clive’s letter came Nessa’s—unstinted praise; on top of that Lytton’s: enthusiastic praise; a grand triumph; a classic; & so on; Violet’s sentence of eulogy followed; & then, yesterday morning, this line from Morgan “I like it less than the V.O.” Though he spoke also of great admiration, & had read in haste & proposed re-reading, this rubbed out all the pleasure of the rest. Yes; but to continue. About 3 in the afternoon I felt happier & easier on account of his blame than on account of the others’ praise—as if one were in the human atmosphere again, after a blissful roll among elastic clouds & cushiony downs. Yet I suppose I value Morgan’s opinion as much as anybodies. Then there’s a column in the Times this morning; high praise; & intelligent too; saying among other things that N. & D. though it has less brilliance on the surface, has more depth than the other; with which I agree. I hope this week will see me through the reviews, I should like intelligent letters to follow; but I want to be writing little stories; I feel a load off my mind all the same.

The rheumatism made me visit the region which is in my mind the mediaeval region. Clive burst in I was going to say like a ruddy sun last night; but I wasn’t altogether in the mood, nor he either. The most selfish of men, in some ways; though I don’t know why that struck me. Letting his mood have its way, indifferent & frivolous. But I pinned him down, & made him talk about N. & D. which he did, absentmindedly at first; later he warmed to his task; but he was thinking of a jolly time in Paris."
1919.11.01,"Shall I ever again get time for writing here? Never have I been so pressed with reviewing, for theres George Eliot to fill up all crannies left by other books, & Murry to choke effectually any empty space remaining. I think I might slack off if N. & D. succeeds. No more letters or reviews. A cheque for £25 though, on copies sold before publication. Happily the book begins to recede from the front of my mind, & I begin to be a little surprised if people speak of it (not that anyone has—but meeting Mde Champcomunal yesterday, I was glad she’d not heard of it). This lady whose name I shall never write again, wishes to share Tregerthen: the plan may be the perfect one. She is a grenadier of a woman, high red cheek bones, thin, competent, handsome, unhappy, tailor made & up to date. I met her at Regent Square—all lights out; a single candle, electricians insistent. Sometimes I wish that the old laws of life held good: a husband, a house, servants, establishments. That same afternoon I looked in at the London Group; but saw nothing save people I had no wish to see; ran into Noel Olivier walking through the Squares. November descends. Squire’s new monthly [The London Mercury] out; and now—Middlemarch!"
1919.11.04,"And now I only steal time from an hour dedicated to Stokoe’s poems before Miss Green arrives & we plod off in the foggy cold to address the Guild upon the Russian revolution. The hard scrubbed surface of the lower middle class mind, does not attract me. This refers partly to Mr Osborne. I’m critical, intellectually, of the aristocrats but sensually they charm. I was hauled out of the background to talk to Katie at the Richmond’s concert on Sunday. Her beautiful blue eyes all bleared & blood shot now, her skin soft like the skin on an old apple; like an apple’s creased at the edge of the mouth, baggy here & there. What sorrow she has had to make her look sad I don’t know. The following dialogue went forward.

K. The Cecils have given up their house—couldn’t afford it—

V. But he has £5,000 a year!

K. No such thing; besides everyone must economise. My dear Virginia, ‘the end is coming. A la lanterne!’

V. For you I daresay; not for me.

K. Ah, there’s where you mistake. I go first, but you directly after.

V. Well, after 300 years of Longleat, you deserve it.

K. It was so beautiful—you don’t know how beautiful.

V. You rode?

K. I walked in the woods. We had music. I used to read; & always beautiful things to look at; always something new, never the same things twice over. I had it for 13 years; & I used to say I wished I could die when it was over: I wish I had.

V. But you haven’t done so badly.

K. I didn’t care for Egypt. I dont care for that sort of thing—2 men running before my carriage. I envied them—the only people who got any exercise. Civilisation is at an end. My father always warned us. I’ve read history. We’re all going to go. Painters will be [the] only people wanted—to paint bodies pretty patterns. No one means to work. There’ll be no clothes—

So we talked in the intervals of Mozart.

This is the daily talk in Mayfair I suppose. She seemed to be convinced of it; almost grown indifferent; her one desire to save something for her son, & to die before the crash. But spoken with a kind of humorous resignation which foretells a gallant death on the scaffold."
1919.11.06,"Sydney & Morgan dined with us last night. On the whole, I’m glad I sacrificed a concert. The doubt about Morgan & N. & D. is removed; I understand why he likes it less than V.O. &, in understanding, see that it is not a criticism to discourage. Perhaps intelligent criticism never is. All the same, I shirk writing it out, because I write so much criticism. What he said amounted to this: N. & D. is a strictly formal & classical work; that being so one requires, or he requires, a far greater degree of lovabilility in the characters than in a book like V.O. which is vague & universal. None of the characters in N. & D. is lovable. He did not care how they sorted themselves out. Neither did he care for the characters in V.O. but there he felt no need to care for them. Otherwise, he admired practically everything; his blame does not consist in saying that N. & D. is less remarkable than t’other. O & beauties it has in plenty—in fact, I see no reason to be depressed on his account. Sidney said he had been completely upset by it; & was of opinion that I had on this occasion ‘brought it off’. But what a bore I’m becoming! Yes, even old Virginia will skip a good [deal] of this; but at the moment it seems important. The Cambridge Magazine repeats what Morgan said about dislike of the characters; yet I am in the forefront of contemporary literature. I’m cynical about my figures, they say: but directly they go into detail, Morgan who read the Review sitting over the gas fire, began to disagree. So all critics split off, & the wretched author who tries to keep control of them is torn asunder.

For the first time this many years I walked along the river bank between ten & eleven. Yes, its like the shut up house I once compared it to: the room with its dust sheets on the chairs. The fishermen are not out so early; an empty path; but a large aeroplane on business. We talked very easily, the proof being that we (I anyhow) did not mind silences. Morgan has the artists mind; he says the simple things that clever people don’t say; I find him the best of critics for that reason. Suddenly out comes the obvious thing that one has overlooked. He is in trouble with a novel of his own, fingering the keys but only producing discords so far. He is anxious to begin again & moderate reviewing. We timed our walk admirably for him to catch his train, We have promised to go to the Hutchinsons tonight; but as L. is at the Famine Conference, & there’s something disagreeable to me about that circle which makes me reluctant to go alone, I don’t suppose we shall."
1919.11.15,"It is true that I have never been so neglectful of this work of mine. I think I can foresee in my reluctance to trace a sentence, not merely lack of time & a mind tired of writing, but also one of those slight distastes which betokens a change of style. So an animal must feel at the approach of spring when his coat changes. Will it always be the same? Shall I always feel this quicksilver surface in my language; & always be shaking it from shape to shape? But if this is so, it is only part cause of my neglect. There have been substantial difficulties. We were with Lytton last Sunday; on Monday I was at Harrisons, & back just in time for Moll H. (to distinguish her from Molly M.): Tuesday I wrote letters; Wednesday, at a concert, with Violet Dickinson immediately after; Thursday Molly M., for tea & after tea; Friday to Margaret & Lilian, & so here I am, sitting after Saturday tea, a large warm meal, full of currants & sugar & hot tea cake, after a long cold walk. If I shut my eyes & thought of Tidmarsh, what should I see? Carrington a little absorbed with household duties; secreting canvas in the attic; Saxon mute & sealed till Sunday night, when he flowered for a time & talked of Greek; Lytton—a more complex situation. Good & simple & tender—a little low in tone; a little invalidish. If I’d married him, I caught myself thinking, I should have found him querulous. He would have laid too many ties on one, & repined a little if one had broken free. He was in his usual health (as they say); but the sense of living so much for health, & assembling so many comforts round him with that object is a little depressing. But I always qualify these strictures, which I’m quick to find I know, with some subconscious idea of justifying myself. I need no justification. And what I feel for Lytton is as true as ever it was. We sit alone over the fire & rattle on, so quick, so agile in our jumps & circumventions. Lytton I suppose if one could dissolve all extraneous surroundings has in the centre of him a great passion for the mind. He cares for more than literature only. On his table were the latest editions of Voltaire. His books were as primly ranged & carefully tended as an old maids china. He talked of his own work, not optimistically, but one must discount the effect of my perhaps excessive optimism about my own writing. I was in the vein to feel very highly ‘creative’, as indeed he said he thought me. But he declares himself entirely without that power. He can invent nothing, he says; take away his authorities, & he comes to a full stop. Perhaps this is true of all Stracheys, & accounts for the queer feeling—which I will not analyse, since in Lytton’s case the rightness, the subtlety, the fineness, of his mind quite overcome my furtive discomfort. Moll H. still strains at her leash like the spaniel of my legend; but foams with enthusiasm for N. & D. It is a rough eager mind, bold & straightforward, but O dear—when it comes to writing! Her courage impresses me; & the sense she gives of a machine working at high pressure all day long—the ordinary able machine of the professional working woman. A tailor made coat costing £16 is essential she said to exact respect in an office. That shows her competent grasp upon life. But why do I always like people & so throw out my judgments? It is true that I always do.

I think Violet Dickinson must be skipped, save that I may note how she has been grave finding in France & planting Lady Horner’s rosemarys upon German tombs. All this she enjoyed highly, in her humorous sporting way, & had been most touched by an inscription she found telling how Ainsworth of the hussars had loved his life & loved his horse & dog.

So we skip to Molly who took her tea in the kitchen & drew an amusing sketch of Uncle Gerald Ritchie gone mad & rushing in taxis from fruiterer to fruiterer to buy melons which he showers on his friends in an ecstasy of good temper, pronounced madness by the doctors since he is positively rude to his wife. Lastly, we approach the heights of Hampstead—the immaculate & moral heights of Hampstead. Had I the energy left I would write out that scene of revelation & explanation with Margaret, since in 30 minutes we traversed more ground than in the past 3 years. Tentatively she began it—how Janet & she felt that perhaps—they might be wrong, but still in their view—in short my article on Charlotte Brontë was so much more to their liking than my novels. Something in my feeling for human beings—some narrowness—some lack of emotion—here I blazed up & let fly. So you go on preaching humanity, was the gist of what I said, when you’ve withdrawn, & preserve only the conventional idea of it. But its you that are narrow! she retaliated. On the contrary, I shiver & shrink with the oncoming contest as I step up your stairs. I? But I’m the most sympathetic, the most human, the most universal of people. You grant that Janet moralises? I said. O yes, she granted that readily. But the idea of herself as a forcible intense woman, excluding the greater half of the human heart staggered her. She took the blow well. It was as if one had suddenly drawn some curtain. She must think it over, & write to me she said. I plunged down the hill to Lilian’s bedside, & she in her serene quiet way said “Ah, I’m glad you told Margaret that; she never will let me say it.”
"
1919.11.28,"This gap can easily be accounted for by recalling the old saying (if it is one) that when things happen, people don’t write. Too many things have happened. Within this last fortnight the International Review has come to an end; both servants are going; two publishers have offered to publish N. & D. & V. O. in America; Angelica has stayed with us; Mrs Brewer has told us that she means to sell Hogarth & Suffield, & we are considering buying them both—together with a greater number than usual of diners, letters, telephone calls, books to review, reviews of my book, invitations to parties & so forth. It was the dinner parties that led Nelly to give notice last Monday. She did it in a tentative boastful way, as if to show off to someone behind the scenes which makes me think she would be glad now to change her mind. She would this moment if I asked her. But on the whole I’m not going to ask her. Let alone the recurring worry of these scenes we both incline to try a new system of dailies, which never ceases to attract us & what with Rodmell & a lower income from the I.R. now becomes desirable. My opinion never changes that our domestic system is wrong; & to go on saying this only breeds irritation. We mean to make the attempt now. No one could be nicer than Nelly, for long stretches; at this moment she gives Angelica her bath, & is perfectly friendly & considerate to me; but think of Rodmell—think of the summer she offered to go to Charleston! The drawbacks are too great. But the fault is more in the system of keeping two young women chained in a kitchen to laze & work & suck their life from two in the drawing room than in her character or in mine.

Perhaps I think this our chief event, since I put it first. But the chief event should be the I.R. I’m on the whole glad that we draw our £250 for half L.’s work. That is the solution so far—an amalgamation with the Contemporary. So many afternoons I walked alone, so many evenings L. sat reading proofs or papers; to me the red magazine on the first of the month seemed scarcely worth all of him that he gave. But then to have thrown that away is galling too, & the Rowntree’s methods of making arrangements is to smash everything with his heavy hooves. Then I was considerably pleased with the American publishers, & that the old V.O. should set sail again. It is like going into another form. “Mrs Woolf you are now admitted to our society.” Yet that sort of compliment means very little so far as praise goes; nor was I elated for more than 2 hours by Eagle [J. C. Squire]’s invitation to make his broad yellow production my mouthpiece. K.M. wrote a review which irritated me—I thought I saw spite in it. A decorous elderly dullard she describes me; Jane Austen up to date. Leonard supposes that she let her wish for my failure have its way with her pen. He could see her looking about for a loophole of escape. “I’m not going to call this a success—or if I must, I’ll call it the wrong kind of success.” I need not now spread my charity so wide, since Murry tells me she is practically cured. But what I perceive in all this is that praise hardly warms; blame stings far more keenly; & both are somehow at arms length. Yet its on the cards, I suppose, that N & D is a marked success; I expect a letter every day from someone or other, & now I can write with the sense of many people willing to read. Its all pleasant; lights up the first sentences of my writing of a morning. Today, bearing K.M. in mind, I refused to do Dorothy Richardson for the Supt. The truth is that when I looked at it, I felt myself looking for faults; hoping for them. And they would have bent my pen, I know. There must be an instinct of self-preservation at work. If she’s good then I’m not. I’m pained to read praise of Legend, a book by Clemence Dane. But it looks as if I had a soul after all; these are revelations, self analyses. I’m reading Ethel Smyth. I wish it were better—(odd that I wrote that genuinely meaning it; but I couldn’t have done so with the novels). What a subject! That one should see it as a superb subject is a tribute to her, but of course, not knowing how to write, she’s muffed it. The interest remains, because she has ridden straight at her recollections, never swerving & getting through honestly, capably, but without the power to still & shape the past so that one will wish to read it again. Honesty is her quality; & the fact that she made a great rush at life; friendships with women interest me.
"
1919.12.05,"Another of these skips, but I think the book draws its breath steadily if with deliberation. I reflect that I’ve not opened a Greek book since we came back; hardly read outside my review books, which proves that my time for writing has not been mine at all. This last week, L. has been having a little temperature in the evening, due to malaria, & that due to a visit to Oxford; a place of death & decay. I’m almost alarmed to see how entirely my weight rests on his prop. And almost alarmed to find how intensely I’m specialised. My mind turned by anxiety, or other cause, from its scrutiny of blank paper, is like a lost child—wandering the house, sitting on the bottom step to cry.

Night & Day flutters about me still, & causes great loss of time. George Eliot would never read reviews, since talk of her books hampered her writing. I begin to see what she meant. I don’t take praise or blame excessively to heart, but they interrupt, cast one’s eyes backwards, make one wish to explain or investigate. Last week I had a cutting paragraph to myself in Wayfarer; this week Olive Heseltine applies balm. But I had rather write in my own way of ‘four Passionate Snails’ than be, as K.M. maintains, Jane Austen over again."
1919.12.06,"On Tuesday I lunched with the Cecils. Perhaps this is my first appearance as a small Lioness. The Bibescos wished to meet me. Lord Cranborne has a great admiration for me. Elizabeth was nicer, & less brilliant than I expected. She has the composed manners of a matron, & did not strain to say clever things. I thought her slightly nervous when we drew into the window to talk. Perhaps she does not like the woman’s eye to rest upon her. She is pasty & podgy, with the eyes of currant bun, suddenly protruding with animation. But her animation is the product of a highly trained mind; a mind trained by living perpetually among more highly trained minds. “Memory comes to take the place of character in the old” she said, discussing Lady D. Nevill. Again, its a help to write things down; but there’s a gulf between writing & publishing. This was said, I remember, owing to my rash abuse of Lady Glenconner & Wyndham Tennant.—her Aunt of course. She turned round, a little uneasily, to disclaim all admiration for Lady G. I suppose she wishes to stand well with the intellectuals. Bibesco is handsome, amiable, a man rather too much of the smooth opulent world to be of particular interest, & his English is too difficult to let one get straight at him. Like all foreigners, he says serious priggish things—“I prefer to believe nothing save what my reason can confirm”—or words to that effect. Lord Robert was congenial as usual, long, loose, friendly & humorous, in spite of the crucifix on his watch chain. Lord Cranbourne much of a Cecil in appearance, modest & gentle, with a long sallow face, no chin, & shiny blue coat & trousers. He had been to a lecture at the London School of Economics. I stayed talking with Nelly when the rest were gone—about adders, about servants, George Eliot, & Night & Day."
1919.12.28,"Probably the last entry this year, & not likely to be the most articulate. Twenty two days gap to be accounted for chiefly by illness: first L.’s which dribbled on; then much in the same way I was attacked—8 days in bed, down today on the sofa, & away to Monks House tomorrow. It was influenza—what they call a low type, but prolonged, & sponging on the head as it always does. Not much to say therefore, even if I could say it. Indeed since L. started his malarial type, we’ve seen few people; & I, for the last 10 days, none at all. But I’ve read two vast volumes of the Life of Butler; & am racing through Greville Memoirs—both superbly fit for illness. Butler has the effect of paring the bark off feelings: all left a little raw, but vivid—a lack of sap though; & a stage so thinly set as to be dull & bone dry towards the finish. I’m struck by the enormous space his ‘fame’ & books played in a life so bare of human relations. Isn’t this ‘reputation’ the deepest of all masculine instincts? Almost at the end, when people began to praise, his life put forth a little flower; but too late. For such a critical & contemptuous mind, the value attached to reviews seems queer. Why, I dont think half or quarter so much of mine! But then he had indifference & silence for his lot; perhaps the most trying. It dont (the Life I mean) increase one’s respect for human nature. Here was someone I expected to admire greatly; & the pettinesses are therefore more devastating than in the case of another. Festing Jones apes him to perfection. An effective style in its way; save that it becomes too mechanical.

Here I run on, but must stop. Oh yes, I’ve enjoyed reading the past years diary, & shall keep it up. I’m amused to find how its grown a person, with almost a face of its own.

L.’s book not yet out; but we have six copies in advance. Nego⁠[tia]⁠tions proceeding for the sale of Hyde Park Gate & the purchase of this & Suffield. Servants determined to stay for ever & ever. No news of the sale of N. & D. Reviews a good deal affected by Massingham, but private opinion highly pleasing to me. I see the public becomes a question. I.R. amalgamated with Contemporary, & L. to keep his office & his virgins. We think we now deserve some good luck. Yet I daresay we’re the happiest couple in England.
"
1920.01.07,"To begin the year on the last pages of my old book—the few I’ve not torn off for letter writing—is all upside-down of course; but of a part with the character of the work.

This is our last evening. We sit over the fire waiting for post—the cream of the day, I think. Yet every part of the day here has its merits—even the breakfast without toast. That—however it begins—ends with Pippins; most mornings the sun comes in; we finish in good temper; & I go off to the romantic chamber over grass rough with frost & ground hard as brick. Then Mrs Dedman comes to receive orders—to give them, really, for she has planned our meals to suit her days cooking before she comes. We share her oven. The result is always savoury—stews & mashes & deep many coloured dishes swimming in gravy thick with carrots & onions. Elsie, aged 18, can be spoken to as though she had a head on her shoulders. The house is empty by half past eleven; empty now at five o’clock; we tend our fire, cook coffee, read, I find, luxuriously, peacefully, at length.

But I should not spend my time on an indoor chronicle; unless I lazily shirked the describing of winter down & meadow—the recording of what takes my breath away at every turn. Heres the sun out for example & all the upper twigs of the trees as if dipped in fire; the trunks emerald green; even bark bright tinted, & variable as the skin of a lizard. Then theres Asheham hill smoke misted; the windows of the long train spots of sun; the smoke lying back on the carriages like a rabbits lop ears. The chalk quarry glows pink; & my water meadows lush as June, until you see that the grass is short, & rough as a dogfishes back. But I could go on counting what I’ve noticed page after page. Every day or nearly I’ve walked towards a different point & come back with a string of these matchings & marvels. Five minutes from the house one is out in the open, a great pull over Asheham; &, as I say, every direction bears fruit. Once we went over the cornfield & up onto the down—a dim Sunday afternoon—muddy on the road, but dry up above. The long down grass pale, & as we pushed through it, up got a hawk at our feet, seeming to trail near the ground, as if weighted down—attached to something. It let the burden fall, & rose high as we came up. We found the wings of a partridge attached to [a] bleeding stump, for the Hawk had almost done his meal. We saw him go back to find it. Further down the hill side a great white owl ‘wavy’ (for that describes his way of weaving a web round a tree—the plumy soft look of him in the dusk adding truth to the word) ‘wavy in the dusk’, flew behind the hedge as we came past. Village girls were returning, & calling out to friends in doors. So we cross the field & churchyard, find our coke burnt through to red, toast the bread—& the evening comes.

L. has spent most of his time pruning the apple trees, & tying plums to the wall. To do this he wears two jackets, 2 pairs of socks, two pairs of gloves; even so the cold bites through. These last days have been like frozen water, ruffled by the wind into atoms of ice against the cheek; then, in the shelter, forming round you in a still pool. Yesterday I explored towards the house with the white chimneys, finding a grass drive all the way; brooks struck off to the right blue as if with sea water. From one a snipe rose zigzagging across & across, flurried & swift. As I advanced the peewits rose in clouds, one dallying behind, & crying peewit, peewit. Then up in the air across the meadows one sees the (the post—but only Mathew’s letter) handful of grain flung in a semi circle

what birds they are I never know. On the down this afternoon I saw the usual flight go up in front of me, & then half wheeled round t’other way. Bells tinkling as I walked along the valley came from a flock attached to the green side, & there on the top against the sky was a string of three great cart horses, stock still, as on a summers day; for they were beside a corn stack. And this I see is my last page so my threat about counting things to that limit was a true one. Human beings have figured less than the red berries, the suns & the moon risings. Letters have come still, as usual, about N⁠[ight] & D⁠[ay], from Sheppard & Roger; both the kind I like; & old Kitty Maxse sees nothing but stupidity, which don’t hurt much—but I’m ashamed of beginning the year with this gossip. Reading Empire & Commerce to my genuine satisfaction, with an impartial delight in the closeness, passion, & logic of it; indeed its a good thing now & then to read one’s husbands work attentively. For the rest, the Education of Henry Adams, &—? I wrote my article on English prose for Murry; & now finish Rosetti, taking leave still from the Times."
1920.01.10,"Ah, that’s all very well, but a fate conspires against a solemn opening ceremony. True, I’ve taken a new nib; but I’m perched high in bug [sic] chair, & can’t settle to read or write, waiting for Lotty to bring in tin tacks, with which to mend my aged broken down eared arm chair. Entrails years ago burst their barriers, & for the past six months I’ve sat on a ridge of wood. Leonard suddenly undertakes to confine entrails within sacking; but we wait for Lotty. A five minutes walk spreads to 45 with her; she calls on Miss Stanford.

So the New Year is broached; 10 days of it already spent. The 1917 Club has the merit of gathering my particular set to a bunch about 4.30 on a week day. There, returning on Thursday, I found Clive (I heard him from the stairs) Morgan, Fredegond & dim background figures just worth a nod turning out to be Oliviers—varieties of Oliviers. Now Clive showed as gaslight beside Morgan’s normal day—his day not sunny or tempestuous but a day of pure light, capable of showing up the rouge & powder, the dust & wrinkles, the cracks & contortions of my poor parrokeet. He makes me feel the footlights myself. The blend of the two was not agreeable; or rather not comfortable. Morgan had a matron waiting for him in Leicester Square. Clive took me in a taxi to Regent Square, after making play with the name of Lytton Strachey. I ran up ahead, & found the room bright & lively; the baby crawling out to fill up a corner, Nessa in her spotted feather hat with the pink plume. I think she thus redeems the rest of her homespun—very successfully. I also think (as Lotty won’t come in—my evening wasting—Lindsay [unidentified] to read—oh dear) that my charms are beneath the horizon; Mary’s about level with the eye; & Nessa’s rising resplendent like the harvest moon. Why, otherwise, dwell so rapturously to me on her dress at the party, her beauty, her grandeur? God knows—perhaps to make himself shine brighter. A long yellow lock hung beneath his ear. “I must cut your hair” said V. Whereupon he took his hat off quickly, fingered the long strand, recognised its mission—to cover the bald patch. But it wouldn’t stay, & fell back again a little repulsively, lacking grease to keep it in place. Compliments for me: but offered as if he were no longer the privileged purveyor. So home by Victoria, noticing there the hustler in his box."
1920.01.14,"On Sunday the Shoves dined here; Monday nothing; Tuesday Club & talk, almost of an intimate kind, with Gumbo; Bob. T., Fredegond, Alix, the background; Wednesday is the present moment, in from a snatched walk at Kew, awaiting Leonard, & expecting a large party, Doggats, Joshua’s &c. at 7.30. So I write as if waiting for a train. I might fill this page & the succeeding ones with the Shoves’ gossip, but I have never determined how far it is permitted to go here in indiscretion. I should have to write at length to retail this specimen properly which is the conclusive reason against it. But it referred to the three days of revelation at Garsington; there was a flush of confession it seems, poured into Fredegond’s ear. It shows how little one knows one’s kind. I should never have expected long fatuous Philip in his leather gaiters, double breasted waistcoat & jewelled buttons to go those lengths. According to Gerald, the general feeling roused in one was pity—such a lonely, in some ways unhappy man. I can’t help smiling at the thought of these semi-ducal, (demi-semi at most, I admit) children playing in the suburbs of Ealing & Streatham, living to be insurance clerks or the like, while Garsington lacks an heir. There! The cat’s out of the bag.

My intimacy with Gumbo came on the flood tide of her appreciation of N. & D. “So solid—so large—such a great—firm building”—“It belongs to literature—an addition to life”. Such sentiments warm one to people. Apart from them, as I think this diary records, I have warmed to her these past years, guessing at a good deal of dreariness, & half expecting that the old light would never blaze again. Now it begins to flicker & that is the origin of her novel. I wonder, parenthetically, whether I too, deal thus openly in autobiography & call it fiction?—Her story is the story of M.S. & J.W. & the conclusion is that she regains happiness, though losing the object. My brain at once spins to clothe her story for her,—how happiness is to be represented by a green here; a yellow there & so on. (novelist or not, some instinct of story telling is pretty quick in me). She is to send me her chapters.

Leonard’s book is out today. To judge by his calm, you would not think it. Great gales in the way of weather; a French ship sunk in the Bay of Biscay, two days after Bella must have passed through; a Cornish steamer wrecked too off Swanage; & on our windows such a battering at night that we woke twice. Violent gusts leaping out of the heart of complete calm—a suggestion of animal savagery; or human frenzy. But what with glass & brick we human beings do pretty well. I sometimes think with wonder that soon the immense thickness & stability of Hogarth House will be mine to whittle away with a penknife, should I so choose. And here—thank goodness—is L."
1920.01.17,"Then there was the party, given in skeleton above. Miss Joshua in pale pink, & the shoes of Artemis—laced with silver round the ankles. Doggatt the spruce innocent young man; with eyes like brown trout streams. Sheppard dancing nervously; & Cecil Taylor, to my mind, adequately fitting the part of enlightened schoolmaster. We got through dinner very well on spur of Cambridge & Christianity; things went, to my taste, lightly & briskly after dinner; & then Bob [Trevelyan] came in. At once we were in another atmosphere. Fantasies were crushed. A Cambridge evening of the 90ties; a Sanger evening; the quality gone; raucous common sense; serious literary criticism, &, what annoyed me, every attempt of a different sort snuffed out directly by Bob’s indefatigable snuffer. He wears blinkers, & sees an indisputable stretch of road, but a narrow one. Sheppard ceased dancing; we argued; we vociferated. Alix arrived, pale as clay, & not much lighter in the mind. I lost my balance; my vanity was wounded—in short, I think Bob spoilt the party—but as for seeing that he spoilt it, that vista is shut from him completely. In crept doubts of my liking for S., my liking for Cecil Taylor; the young people one can scarcely like or dislike. So the party ended. Bob stayed. I was gratified by praise of my novel. On this account I suppose, I found the morning more becoming to him than the night. We got back into the Cambridge atmosphere.

Then Ka for the night: now Desmond for the night; tomorrow I go to Roger for the night. All rather heavy going, & cutting up the week into little bits. We had to put off Mrs Clifford; & I’m writing dully, wishing, though I love Desmond, for a solitary night. He has been made successor to Eagle on the Statesman."
1920.01.20,"Years ago as a child I made up a wise saw to the effect that if one didn’t expect a party to be nice it was & t’other way round. So Desmond’s visit was easy, refreshing, & passed without hitch. We had a fine store of talk to keep us going.—The story of his voyage—of Captain Deakes & Captain Haines; their obscenity that made one sick; the squall at sea; arrival at Cape Town; Mrs Paley’s surprise; Paley’s greeting ‘but we didn’t expect you—’ His wire ‘Desmond sailed’ arriving Desmond failed—(as indeed he might probably have done)—all this in the lovely soft voice, with more than the usual freshness & abundance. As for decadence or decay—not a trace of it: fresh & firm & friendly. Then much talk of the New Statesman—projects without number—to be noted down: letters to be written. Secretly, I think, he was much excited & pleased. Five hundred assured; 250 of it dependent on a weekly article, signed Affable Hawk (this is a dead secret). Off we went after tea to Roger’s, all across Europe to the Brecknock Arms. Buses pass you bound for Barnet. As we both depend upon holding to a button naturally we did not arrive easily. The house very high & narrow, with many large rooms, & a bright lining of pictures. Roger to my eyes slightly shrunken, aged? Can one use that word of him? And I don’t know how much I colour him from my own depression—for I guessed he didn’t much care for N. & D. So I went on to fancy him wilful; to trace veins of irrational prejudice in him. He showed freakish by side of D.’s benevolence; old sea captains telling dirty stories not in his line; nor novels either. Yet he professed to find it much superior to the V⁠[oyage].O⁠[ut]."
1920.01.21,"It would be easy to take up the line that Roger’s praise is not worth having, since it is balanced by what appears an irrational prejudice. If the prejudice is on your side, well & good; though even so it sweeps one too far to leave one steady in the head. I sometimes fancy that the only healthy condition is that of doing successful work. Its the prime function of the soul. R.’s work never meeting with the right sort of appreciation, he suffers perpetually from an obscure irritation. The main form it takes is irritation against England; I fancy I can trace it elsewhere also. He is testy without much occasion, & too easily reverts to grievances, how art critics hate him, how its only in France that they care for his pictures—why, he was accusing Clive of taking his ideas & selling them to America for £200—but on this point I happen to agree with him. If I’m sincere, however, I see that I’m led to infer all this from what I note in my own disposition under a cloud. For one thing, I find it difficult to write. I held my pen this morning for two hours & scarcely made a mark. The marks I did make were mere marks, not rushing into life & heat as they do on good days. Perhaps Roger was the first cloud; Desmond may have contributed a little; & then how many silly things I did yesterday, ending by ringing up the Richmonds at their dinner, & being painfully snubbed by Elena on that account. I should like here to analyse; instead I must wash & dress & dine at the Club & so to Moll Hamilton’s party, which I predict will be dull, & more shocks will be administered, & I shall creep cold to bed."
1920.01.24,"But on the contrary—I didn’t creep cold to bed, & the party amused me as a spectacle—I should more truly say astonished me as a pandemonium. Molly can be heard out in the Adelphi; then, as the hostess sets the key, some hundred people, opening their mouths, tried to overcome her, by dint of roaring. I got my station in a corner, between Clive & Norton, & enjoyed the sense of irresponsible amusement. Not a human festival at all. Everyone smiling. As they could scarcely express their pleasure in words this was a necessary device. Margot was there—oh well, unpleasantly disfigured, in a low dress. I tried to turn her periods into laughter. Humour might do more to dissolve her poetry than criticism. Then young Mr Evans confided to me that his admiration of N. & D. was personal ‘to tell you the truth I’m going through the same thing myself’—poor little man! Yet I was pleased to think my psychology ‘intense’ & ‘modern’ & illuminating the crannies of Mr Evan’s personal existence.

Oh dear, though, this talk of novels is all turned sour & brackish by a visit to Mrs Clifford. She must have supplied herself with false teeth since I saw her—20 years ago; & her hair frizzed out is surely browned by art; but she remains otherwise the same—large codfish eyes & the whole figure of the nineties—black velvet—morbid—intense, jolly, vulgar—a hack to her tips, with a dash of the stage—‘dear’ ‘my dear boy—Did you know Leonard, that I was only married for 3 years, & then my husband died & left me with 2 babies & not a penny—so I had to work—oh yes, I worked, & sold the furniture often, but I never borrowed.’ However the pathetic is not her line. She talks it to fill up space; but if I could reproduce her talk of money, royalties, editions, & reviews, I should think myself a novelist; & the picture might serve me for a warning. I think one may assume it to be more a product of the 90ties than of our age. Again, having years ago made a success, she’s been pulling the wires to engineer another ever since, & has grown callous in the process. Her poor old lips pout for a pat of butter; but margarine will do. She keeps her private & very rancid supply on some of the little tables that those distressing rooms are lumbered with (a wooden black cat on the clock, & little carved animals under it): she has a review of herself in the Bookman & a portrait, & a paper of quotations about Miss Fingal. I assure you I can hardly write this down—Moreover, I had a feeling that in these circles people do each other good turns; & when she proposed to make my fortune in America, I’m afraid a review in the Times was supposed to be the equivalent. Brave, I suppose, with vitality & pluck—but oh the sight of the dirty quills [?], & the scored blotting paper & her hands & nails not very clean either—& money, reviews, proofs, helping hands, slatings—what an atmosphere of rancid cabbage & old clothes stewing in their old water! We went away laden with two of the cheap flaring books—‘Are you going to take my mangy works! to tell the truth I’m in debt—’ Yes, but was that why we were asked to tea? Not altogether, I suppose, but, partly; subconsciously. And now, you see, all colour is taken from my boasting; a 2nd edition of the Voyage Out needed; & another of Night & Day shortly; & Nisbet offers me £100 for a book. Oh dear there must be an end of this! Never write for publishers again anyhow.

I’ve no time or finger power left to describe Desmond in his office; my haul of biographies; luncheon at Gordon Sqre; sitting in the great chairs before Clive’s fire afterwards; the apparition of Adrian; affection of Mary, & comparative docility of Clive.

I had tea with Lilian the other evening; we kissed silently: for my errand was to while away an hour of suspense for her while she waits for the verdict on her eyes. She may be blind, I suppose—oh dear; & nothing could be said about it. What courage can make one, at 50, look down the remaining years, with that calamity to darken them!"
1920.01.26,"The day after my birthday; in fact I’m 38. Well, I’ve no doubt I’m a great deal happier than I was at 28; & happier today than I was yesterday having this afternoon arrived at some idea of a new form for a new novel. Suppose one thing should open out of another—as in An Unwritten Novel—only not for 10 pages but 200 or so—doesn’t that give the looseness & lightness I want: doesnt that get closer & yet keep form & speed, & enclose everything, everything? My doubt is how far it will include enclose the human heart—Am I sufficiently mistress of my dialogue to net it there? For I figure that the approach will be entirely different this time: no scaffolding; scarcely a brick to be seen; all crepuscular, but the heart, the passion, humour, everything as bright as fire in the mist. Then I’ll find room for so much—a gaiety—an inconsequence—a light spirited stepping at my sweet will. Whether I’m sufficiently mistress of things—thats the doubt; but conceive mark on the wall, K⁠[ew]. G⁠[ardens]. & unwritten novel taking hands & dancing in unity. What the unity shall be I have yet to discover: the theme is a blank to me; but I see immense possibilities in the form I hit upon more or less by chance 2 weeks ago. I suppose the danger is the damned egotistical self; which ruins Joyce & [Dorothy] Richardson to my mind: is one pliant & rich enough to provide a wall for the book from oneself without its becoming, as in Joyce & Richardson, narrowing & restricting? My hope is that I’ve learnt my business sufficiently now to provide all sorts of entertainments. Anyhow, there’s no doubt the way lies somewhere in that direction; I must still grope & experiment but this afternoon I had a gleam of light. Indeed, I think from the ease with which I’m developing the unwritten novel there must be a path for me there.

Yesterday being my birthday & a clear bright day into the bargain showing many green & yellow flushes on the trees, I went to South Kensington & heard Mozart & Beethoven. I don’t think I did hear very much of them, seated as I was between Katie & Elena, & pitched headforemost into outrageous banter of the usual kind with the Countess. But the Countess was very affable & jolly, invited me indeed insisted upon my coming, to tea with her. We turned our money under the new moon. She vibrated under the pleasure of a compliment—“when Lady Cromer’s there one feels &c &c—” a compliment to her beauty. But the room was clamorous with South Kensington. Eily Darwin in particular, fat & decorous & affectionate, yet plaintive as of old, as if protesting before one spoke against criticism. She told me I had been cruel. I forget now what I said—something wild & random, as everything said under those circumstances must be. George Booth took my arm & praised my book."
1920.01.31,"Here is my calendar: Tuesday the Squires & Wilkinson & Edgar to dinner; Wednesday tea with Elena; Thursday lunch with Nessa, tea Gordon Square; Friday Clive & Mary here; & Saturday sitting over the fire with a morbid & I hope unfounded fear lest certain creatures infesting Lottie & Nelly may begin to twitter beneath my skin. An incident of this sort is like the blackness that used to cross the waves in the bay & make my heart sink when I sat doing lessons at the long table in St Ives drawing room. Sordid—cheap—And the impression was enforced by a visit to Putney. The streets of villas make me more dismal than slums. Each has a cropped tree growing out of a square lifted from the pavement in front of it. Then the interiors—But I dont want to dwell on this. As Leonard said, its the soul of Sylvia in stucco. They were sitting in the dining room with a large table, reading novels—Its partly that I’m a snob. The middle classes are cut so thick, & ring so coarse, when they laugh or express themselves. The lower classes don’t do this at all.

It is said that Mr Wilkinson was nearly drunk; that excuse can’t serve Mrs Squire though; she has spread more widely; is even more settled into a kind of whitish sediment; a sort of indecency to me in her passive gloating contentment in the arm chair opposite; like some natural function, performing automatically—a jelly fish—without volition, yet with terrifying potentiality. She breaks off into young on the least provocation: Squire is at least direct & honest. I don’t like it when he talks about love patriotism & paternity, but on the other hand I can speak my mind to him. Love came into the discussion on account of the Athenaeum. According to Squire the A. denies everything. It is a frost of death for all creative activity. Now the London Mercury provides a very fertile soil. He pressed me to write for the London Mercury. The A. is winning itself a bad name, on account of its hard sceptical tone. I tried to explain to Squire that there is such a thing as honesty & a high standard; his retort is & there are such things as poetry & enthusiasm. At present the battle in our circles is between James & Desmond. James wishes to ‘stab humbug dead’. Desmond & I wish, on the contrary, to revive it like a phoenix from its ashes. The difference is fundamental; but I am equally able to write for Murry, Squire or Desmond—a proof of catholicity or immorality, according to your taste.

But with us its a question of drains. We are in for a spell of bad luck & find ourselves compelled to spend £200 perhaps on drains, which, six months ago, would have been Mrs Brewer’s concern. Still, we had fears for a thousand.

At tea with Elena, in the absence of Bruce [Richmond], we broached, delicately, the subject of the [Times Literary] Supplement. She said that people were nice to her in order to influence reviews. She said they made Bruce’s life a burden to him. I lightly sketched my interview with Mrs Clifford. It was all known to her, I could see; she knew Mrs Clifford’s methods. She dines with Lady Dilke, & hears her japes with Stephen McKenna. I liked Elena for sharing my feeling of repulsion; indeed she is more clearminded & innocent than I am, & regards it through the simple brown eyes of the nicest, most modest, of collie dogs. I liked her better than before, & she sat on a stool, & told me how she does this that & the other for the diseased & the afflicted, & I thought she must be a pleasant sight at a bedside. People who have no brilliance or subtlety seem to take things in directly & sanely in such a way as to abash me, who count myself among the brilliant. There they are, it seems, without exertion or self applause: nor are they much deceived by brilliance. The rest I must skip, since I have 6 biographies to read for Desmond. A letter from a Mr Askew in Staffordshire about N. & D. pleasant; & odd to please the lower classes."
1920.02.04,"I had rather catch Leonard’s itch than Lottie’s—that’s my only contribution to lice psychology which still occupies our minds, & wastes our mornings; & poisons our quiet after tea. For according to Fergusson, they turn over in their lairs when warm. No improvement so far—also, so far as I know, no infection. But imagination! By taking thought I can itch at any point on my hundreds of inches of skin. I do it now.

The mornings from 12 to 1 I spend reading the Voyage Out. I’ve not read it since July 1913. And if you ask me what I think I must reply that I don’t know—such a harlequinade as it is—such an assortment of patches—here simple & severe—here frivolous & shallow—here like God’s truth—here strong & free flowing as I could wish. What to make of it, Heaven knows. The failures are ghastly enough to make my cheeks burn—& then a turn of the sentence, a direct look ahead of me, makes them burn in a different way. On the whole I like the young womans mind considerably. How gallantly she takes her fences—& my world what a gift for pen & ink! I can do little to amend; & must go down to posterity the author of cheap witticisms, smart satires & even, I find, vulgarisms—crudities rather—that will never cease to rankle in the grave. Yet I see how people prefer it to N. & D.—I dont say admire it more, but find it a more gallant & inspiriting spectacle.

To Madame Grave’s this afternoon—& found her in her great new house. Maman is getting very trying poor dear. You set her on the stool & she does nothing. Then she wants the stool again—But you’ve just been there & done nothing maman! Then she calls me cruel—very trying. And when she sleeps her mouth hangs down, as though she were dead. She’s getting senile. All this simply, tenderly even, as we wander about the house, looking at the furniture. I like her childishness, & her unquenchable desire to make me another dress which will really be done in a week when she cant finish what’s on hand."
1920.02.13,"Again many lapses & the same excuses. For some time now life has been considerably ruffled by people. Age or fame or the return of peace—I dont know which—but anyhow I grow wearied of ‘going out to tea’; & yet cant resist it. To leave a door shut that might be open is in my eyes some form of blasphemy. That may be; meanwhile I neither write my diary nor read my Greek. There was a lunch party at the Café Royal on the day of Duncan’s private view to record: 12 guests; everything handsomely done; I stimulated & fuddled with wine; a queer assortment of the usual & the unusual. There was Mrs Grant, a woman still sailing like a yatcht under the breath of mature charm; Pippa; Adrian; Bunny; Lytton. Lytton had laid out £70 on one of the pictures. Maynard rose & said “To our deep affection for Duncan”. I fancy Duncan would rather have done without fuss, & he slunk off after lunch, leaving us to visit the show. It’s absurd—my capacity for flooding scenes with irrational excitement; in which mood I say rather more than I mean; or rather what I do mean. Surveying the room with Adrian I thought him despondent, like a man now aware of failure, & contrasting his life with those of his contemporaries. ‘How distinguished we all are!’ I said; & then it came out—or did I imagine it all?—that he & K⁠[arin]. feel themselves isolated & like people who have been ploughed in some examination. About 35 the lists are posted up for everyone to read. On the impulse of this I invited them to dine; & when they come I shall find myself, I predict, utterly at fault. Meanwhile I say nothing & have nothing to say of Duncan’s pictures. They spun in my head like the white wine I’d drunk; so lovely, so delicious, so easy to adore. However I only caught glimpses here & there as well dressed people moved across them. Then tea with Roger at the Burlington, walking across with Maynard; & hearing that his book is now in the 15th thousand; but to the credit of Cambridge he remains unmoved, & is more, instead of less, modest than before.

Next day I bought one of Duncan’s pictures; sacrificing a pomegranate coloured dress which much took my fancy. The dress connects itself with tea at Eily’s. She disappointed me: slovenly, compromising, slouching through life content at heart with the second best but complaining on the surface—so she struck me; & so matronly & decorous & such a trim smug home, & such commonplace children. Honest Bernard, being honest & of the Darwin ware that never cracks, pleased me much better. He talked about golf & the Waddon Chase dispute. But I shall never see Eily again.

After that, I must skip over forgotten days & alight at Ottoline’s last night (I skip tea with Ottoline & Birrell & Tony Birrell the imbecile). Yet I don’t know that I can describe an evening party—Philip & I sitting together watched the door open & people come in. There were more of the shady smart sort than of old; or so they looked to me since I did not know them. There were Eliots & Huxleys & Forster &—all the rest. My single diversion was a dialogue with W. J. Turner, an inarticulate rednosed, infinitely modest man, with prominent brown eyes, nice vague eyes, seeming to wish to tell the truth; yet too shy to be ready with it. Squire felt me fathoming his soul t’other night; so he said; Squire respects me immensely; oh well, I’m afraid that had some share in my liking for Turner. At a party now I feel a little famous—the chances are people like Turner whose names I know, also know my name. Moreover, people like Turner are very glad to be praised. That comes always as a surprise. The Eliots gladly dine with us. Murry is affectionate & bantering. I must have one coloured figure though in my black & white; I must spare a phrase for the sealing wax green of Ottoline’s dress. This bright silk stood out over a genuine crinoline. She did control the room on account of it. Yet I dreamt all night of her disillusioned with a weak pouting face, revealing her inner discontent. If anyone is disillusioned she, so they say, is. Indeed I can’t help thinking her unhappy!

Last week end at the Arnold Forsters I’ve entirely left out."
1920.02.15,"Partly to obliterate the Webbs, partly to put off for a few minutes reading the Voyage Out I will say that we lunched with the Webbs; had Adrian, Sanger & Hussey to dine last night. But the Webbs! I find the hour of 1.30 on a cold blowy day, precisely fitting to them. As we walk down Grosvenor Road the old papers blow & the middle classes parade in their Sunday clothes. The houses have a red raw look. Factory chimneys face the windows across the river. Owing to Sunday all barges are moored. There is no sun or warmth. But what are they going for? Why should the right pursuits be so entirely hideous? Then theres the mutton & the cabbage & apple tart—all adequate but joyless. Bad cigarettes. A little whisky. The drawing room now a glacial white with water colours hung accurately apart. Mrs Webb displaying shark like teeth. Webb daubed red, & clumsily thick in person. The window in the back room is of frosted glass to conceal back windows. No longer am I frightened; only dreary & dismal, & rasped all over by the sense of so hideous a prospect. Mr Cross of the Foreign Office had brough⁠[t] six portfolios of papers to be looked through. Mrs Webb told me it was wrong to prevent L. from going into Parliament; we want men of subtle intellect &—But what is ‘right’ & who are ‘we’. Frostily friendly she said good bye. One deals with the situation more easily, but the horror of it increases with familiarity. Shall we become like that too? I stamp up & down the platform to warm myself; steep my hands in hot water, crouch over the fire, but still I’m irritated & exacerbated."
1920.03.03,"So then at the end of that week we went to Rodmell, & are back again two days ago. But I’ve numbers of old clothes in my dirty clothes basket—scenes, I mean, tumbled pell mell into my receptacle of a mind, & not extracted till form & colour are almost lost. I suppose ‘going out to tea’ continued; oh, there was a dinner at Gordon Square, when Mary, becoming almost peevish in her bedroom refused to part with hair pins: I made a note of that scene; & have branded her ‘stupid’—can one say vulgar? I think not. But dressing for gentlemen induces some disease of the complexion when examined by pure feminine light. Desmond was there: Desmond warm, affectionate, the oldest friend, so I sometimes feel; perhaps the best. I was touched, that is, that he ran along the platform to wish me goodnight. Then we sold Uncle Thoby for £150 to Mr Prinsep: & directly I got the cheque I regretted it—oh dear—again. I’m learning this trick, & wake saying it.

Then there was Roger’s speech at the Club & my first effort—5 minutes consecutive speaking—all very brilliant, & opening the vista of that form of excitement not before glimpsed at. Dined with Nessa & Duncan in Soho. Saw the woman drop her glove. A happy evening. Eliot & Sydney dine—Sydney righting himself after our blow about Suffield—not without a grampus sigh or so—Then off to Monks—& here I should write large & bright about the SPRING. It has come. It has been with us over a fortnight. Never did a winter sleep more like an infant sucking its thumb. Daffodils all out; garden set with thick golden crocuses; snowdrops almost over; pear trees budding; birds in song; days like June with a touch of the sun—not merely a painted sky but a warm one. Now we’ve been to Kew. I assure you, this is the earliest & loveliest & most sustained spring I remember. Almond trees out."
1920.03.06,"No sooner had I written this [the date] than Madame Gravé appeared, & has left only the wreck of an evening behind her. Still if I don’t fill a page now, God knows when I shall again: an endless prospect of unrecorded activity now stretches before me: also behind. Did I say that Desmond & I cheered the return of Mr Asquith to Parliament? I saw a sleek white satiny looking bare head. Also Margot standing up, swaying slightly, & drawing her hands to & from her lips, while a policeman squirmed on the carriage roof—always a touch of the grotesque in these proceedings, though emotions rose like a spring tide, & swept me off my feet, or rather elevated me unconsciously to a parapet, whence I saw the aforementioned bare white head. Tea with Molly & old Mrs MacCarthy; emotions—about the death of a friend; gossip about the Blunts’ law suit: Molly wearing 2 minute cows horns above her ears.

Then?—Tuesday & Wednesday here in Richmond printing Hope; & Elena dined with us on Tuesday & made a speech at the Guild, & presented me incidentally with one of those puzzles which I always get wrong I fancy. How far can she be talked to? Is her withdrawal shock or stupidity? Then this ‘niceness’; what does it amount to? For seconds she can make me feel crude & provincial; then, as I say, there’s the silence—& Heaven knows what goes forward. The machine seems to stop. As for her liking or disliking—I know nothing about it. Her personal presence—so comely, stately & maternal always reduces me—till I grate on the rocks of (I suppose) her indifference to my enthusiasm. I rather believe that the nice people feel more temperately & universally than we do—& with none of our passion.

Then on Thursday, dine with the Macarthys, & the first Memoir Club meeting. A highly interesting occasion. Seven people read—& Lord knows what I didn’t read into their reading. Sydney [Waterlow], to whom the occasion was one of some importance, signified as much by reading us a dream—in reality a parable, to account for explain the seeming obtuseness of daylight Sydney by the imaginative power of dreaming Sydney—altogether a queer, self-conscious, self analytic performance, interesting to me. Clive purely objective; Nessa starting matter of fact: then overcome by the emotional depths to be traversed; & unable to read aloud what she had written. Duncan fantastic & tongue—not tied—tongue enchanted. Molly literary about tendencies & William Morris, carefully composed at first, & even formal: suddenly saying “Oh this is absurd—I can’t go on” shuffling all her sheets; beginning on the wrong page; firmly but waveringly, & carrying through to the end. “These meagre Welsh, these hard-headed Scots—I detest them—I wanted to be the daughter of a French marquise by a misalliance with—” That was the tone of it—& then “these mild weak Cornishes”. Roger well composed; story of a coachman who stole geraniums & went to prison. Good: but too objective. I doubt that anyone will say the interesting things but they can’t prevent their coming out. Before this by the way, I saw Nessa’s new home, no. 50, inspected Pippa’s chaos at no. 51; & looked in upon Adrian & Karin doing biology in their dining room. Coming out we ran upon James—such is the rabbit warren nature of the place.

Poor Mills Whitham yesterday wanted praise of his book, & I hadn’t read it—poor man—Sylvia a little depressed—but then with a hu⁠[s]⁠band in brown corduroys, writing country novels—unreadably bad—no wonder."
1920.03.09,"In spite of some tremors, I think I shall go on with this diary for the present. I sometimes think that I have worked through the layer of style which suited it—suited the comfortable bright hour after tea; & the thing I’ve reached now is less pliable. Never mind: I fancy old Virginia, putting on her spectacles to read of March 1920 will decidedly wish me to continue. Greetings! my dear ghost; & take heed that I dont think 50 a very great age. Several good books can be written still; & here’s the bricks for a fine one.

To return to the present owner of the name: on Sunday I went up to Campden Hill to hear the S⁠[c]⁠hubert quintet—to see George Booth’s house—to take notes for my story—to rub shoulders with respectability—all these reasons took me there, & were cheaply gratified at 7/6.

Whether people see their own rooms with the devastating clearness that I see them, thus admitted once for one hour, I doubt. Chill superficial seemliness; but thin as a March glaze of ice on a pool. A sort of mercantile smugness. Horsehair & mahogany is the truth of it; & the white panels, Vermeer reproductions, omega table & variegated curtains rather a snobbish disguise. The least interesting of rooms: the compromise; though of course, thats interesting too. I took against the family system. Old Mrs Booth enthroned on a sort of commode in widows dress: flanked by devoted daughters; with grandchildren somehow symbolical cherubs. Such neat dull little boys & girls. There we all sat in our furs & white gloves. Elena asked us to dine: I (perhaps for this reason) exempt her & Bruce from this censure.

Monday at the Club, which I see I’ve ceased to describe. Alix; Bunny, Birrell; James; finally Morgan. Alix told me that Florence Darwin—still I call her Maitland—is dead. For a moment I was shocked. Then it seemed to me that her greatest happiness had been with Fred; then I pitied poor old Frank, left for the 3rd time alone. Then an attempt to remember her which I can do rather accurately: the beautiful brown eyes, with the defiant look in them; the brown hair; the colour; the emphatic manner; the exaggeration of her talk—reminding me a little of mother—indeed the manner was much mother’s. Always simply dressed in black, I think; & holding herself superbly—in the sense of proudly, tensely; nerves much on edge; but showing so to us only in her dramatic ways; quick movements; beautiful turns & glances, as she protested—Fred treating her with a kind of bantering courtesy, & amusement; which I felt was the cover of a deep understanding between them not unveiled before us. I went one evening into his study to speak to him; opened the door & stood for a second silent; he raised his eyes, thought for a moment that I was Florence, whereupon he looked tender & intimate as I had never seen him—which look of course vanished directly he recognised me. If I now heard that this letter of Fredegond’s was untrue, I should try to see her again. But what is it that prevents one from ever seeing people, when years have passed, & there have been deaths & births & marriages?"
1920.03.18,"Strange that this should be my last reflection, since without remembering it, I told Irene Noel-Baker that I dreaded the thought of meeting her after 6 or 7 years. She said the same thing—but I rather guess this was simulated. Anyhow we met at the Cecils last Sunday; & I see why she dreads meeting me—because I look at her. Oh you little adventuress, I think to myself, so now you’ve turned matron, & are pushing your way & Philip’s way into political circles—witness the bright comprehending chatter she kept up with Ld. R. & Ormsby Gore. & you’ve got a son, & are proud of nursing him yourself, & you’ve grown plump, & look less romantic—though the positive search for obvious truths is carried on as pertinaciously as ever. Lady Beatrice daughter of Lord Salisbury, a frank dashing brainless young goddess—who palpably loses divinity if you look at her. Her eyes are of the brightness, hardness, & insensibility of greyblue marbles.

Leonard went on to see Waller upon that curious family crisis which I foresaw some years ago. Still if this diary were the diary of the soul I could write at length of the 2nd meeting of the Memoir Club. Leonard was objective & triumphant; I subjective & most unpleasantly discomfited. I dont know when I’ve felt so chastened & out of humour with myself—a partner I generally respect & admire. “Oh but why did I read this egotistic sentimental trash!” That was my cry, & the result of my sharp sense of the silence succeeding my chapter. It started with loud laughter; this was soon quenched; & then I couldn’t help figuring a kind of uncomfortable boredom on the part of the males; to whose genial cheerful sense my revelations were at once mawkish & distasteful. What possessed me to lay bare my soul! Still, the usual revulsion has now taken place. I saw Nessa yesterday, & she guessed at none of this—which indeed Leonard firmly assured me was a miasma on my part due to late nights &c.

Another late night last night, dining with Lytton, Clive & Nessa at the Eiffel Tower. Lytton stuck in Vic: intimate & cordial, with perhaps a touch of regret. “How seldom we meet!” said Nessa. It was true & yet we all want to meet; & can’t do it. They are all speeding south—Nessa, Duncan & Maynard to Italy; Lytton, Carrington & Partridge to Spain."
1920.04.10,"We sped to Rodmell, which accounts for another formidable break. By the way, Morgan keeps a diary, & in his diary Morgan writes conversation—word for word, when the humour takes him. I dont know that the humour takes me to describe our Easter at Monks House. Through the first week of it I was driven, as with shut eyes, eyes being indeed so intent upon Henry James as to see nothing else. That missive despatched, I got such pleasure out of everything that I keep putting houses & streets—yes & people too—against that background, & seeing them look flat & faded. Clive & Mary last night brought in the loud breezy atmosphere of the Brighton pier. We are getting middle aged. I see him stout, kind—indeed cordial—but so cynical as to be almost uninteresting. Poor Mary has little of the Brass Band about her; but much of the mute meretricious fille de joie—I’ve said that partly for the sake of the m’s; but there’s truth in it. Then, uncomfortably enough, I kept striking upon something soft & unprotected in her—childish, pathetic almost. She’s the mother of children too. I daresay what with one thing & another I’m grown rather brazen—so many compliments (Oh, Morgan just now writes to say my memoir was ‘splendid’—& dare he ask me to review for the Herald—Desmond sends me stalls for the pioneers tomorrow—[Bruce] Richmond—but enough of quotations). Moreover, I can wince outrageously to read K.M.’s praises in the Athenaeum. Four poets are chosen; she’s one of them. Of course Murry makes the choice, & its Sullivan who rates her story a work of genius. Still, you see how well I remember all this—how eagerly I discount it.

To describe Monks House would be to trench upon literature, which I cant do here; since we only slept by snatches last night, & at 4 a.m. turned a mouse out of L.’s bed. Mice crept & rattled all night through. Then the wind got up. Hasp of the window broken. Poor L. out of bed for the 5th time to wedge it with a toothbrush. So I say nothing about our projects at Monks, though the view across meadows to Caburn is before me now; & the hyacinths blooming, & the orchard walk. Then being alone there—breakfast in the sun—posts—no servants—how nice it all is!

I’m planning to begin Jacob’s Room next week with luck. (That’s the first time I’ve written that.) Its the spring I have it [in] my mind to describe; just to make this note—that one scarcely notices the leaves out on the trees this year, since they seem never entirely to have gone in—never any of that iron blackness of the chestnut trunks—always something soft & tinted; such as I can’t remember in my life before. In fact, we’ve skipped a winter; had a season like the midnight sun; & now return to full daylight. So I hardly notice that chestnuts are out—the little parasols spread on our window tree; & the churchyard grass running over the old tombstones like green water.

Mrs Ward is dead; poor Mrs Humphry Ward; & it appears that she was merely a woman of straw after all—shovelled into the grave & already forgotten. The most perfunctory earth strewing even by the orthodox."
1920.04.15,"My handwriting seems to be going to the dogs. Perhaps I confuse it with my writing. I said that Richmond was enthusiastic over my James article? Well, two days ago, little elderly Walkley attacked it in The Times, said I’d fallen into H.J.’s worst mannerisms—hard beaten ‘figures’—& hinted that I was a sentimental lady friend. Percy Lubbock was included too; but, rightly or wrongly, I delete the article from my mind with blushes, & see all my writing in the least becoming light. I suppose its the old matter of ‘florid gush’—no doubt a true criticism, though the disease is my own, not caught from H.J., if thats any comfort. I must see to it though. The Times atmosphere brings it out; for one thing I have to be formal there, especially in the case of H.J.; & so contrive an article rather like an elaborate design; which encourages ornament. Desmond, however, volunteered admiration. I wish one could make out some rule about praise & blame. I predict that I’m destined to have blame in any quantity. I strike the eye; & elderly gentlemen in particular get annoyed. An unwritten novel will certainly be abused; I can’t foretell what line they’ll take this time. Partly, its the ‘writing well’ that sets people off—& always has done, I suppose. ‘Pretentious’ they say; & then a woman writing well, & writing in The Times—that’s the line of it. This slightly checks me from beginning Jacob’s room. But I value blame. It spurs one, even from Walkley; who is (I’ve looked him out) 65, & a cheap little gossip, I’m glad to think, laughed at even by Desmond. But don’t go forgetting that there’s truth in it; more than a grain in the criticism that I’m damnably refined in The Times: refined & cordial: I don’t think its easy to help it: since, before beginning the H.J. article, I took a vow I’d say what I thought, & say it in my own way. Well, I’ve written all this page, & not made out how to steady myself when the Unwritten Novel appears.

Rain has come—what I mind much more is the black sky: so ugly. Yesterday I think I was unhappy all day long. First, Walkley; then 2 teeth out; then tooth ache all the evening; L. out to speak in Richmond; & couldn’t read because of the throb in my gum. The day before I went to the Niggers’ show in Chelsea; very sad impressive figures; obscene; somehow monumental; figures of Frenchmen, I thought, sodden with civilisation & cynicism; yet they were carved (perhaps) in the Congo 100’s of years ago. Hannay came up. ‘Mrs Woolf?’ Yes—but who—? We met years ago at the Squires—Hannay. Ah, you do art criticism now? Tell me what I ought to think of the carvings. And these Peruvian bowls—Its the shape, in the bowls. I’ve lived too long with the carvings. (I don’t think this expresses him, though. A man who spaces his words with long silences—a bad critic I’m told. As one would expect of anyone working at the bookshop.) Then I heard Desmond saying O its upstairs—but in he came with a tall lean brown elderly man in frock coat & top hat. Not introduced to me, as though there were a gulf between us. I slipped out into Chelsea Church, & saw the tablet to H.J.—florid & cultivated if you like—spindly letters, & Jamesian phrases. Perhaps by Gosse. So to Madame Gravé’s—so to the 17 Club—so home. & then my tooth was beginning.

What book can I settle to read? I want something that wont colour my mornings mood—something a little severe. My notion is to write this in chapters straight off; not beginning one unless I can count on so many days clear for finishing it."
1920.04.17,"The pain from Walkley is dying out, since I’ve begun Jacob’s Room. I can inhibit poor L. as I myself am inhibited. Your trick is repetition, I say: whereupon his pen sticks like a broken machine. To the Bach festival last night; & coincidence led me to run at once into two people I’ve not met for an age, Noel, for one; then, as I settled into my seat, a voice said Virginia! It was Walter Lamb. The egg shaped man—the billiard ball man—sat by me, & told me a great deal about Bach. Bach was very beautiful, though the human element in the choir always distracts me. They aren’t beautiful; all in greens, greys, pinks, blacks, fresh from the suburbs & high tea. The hall seemed to suit them better than the music. Home with Walter. “I had such a vivid dream of Thoby the other night” he said. “He came in after beagling, & said, something very important—I can’t remember what. Very odd—for I don’t think of him often.” He was glad to tell me this. I make him tell me about his Royalties. In fact here’s a secret that mustn’t be repeated—Walter is writing Prince Albert’s Academy speech for him. He has a nimble mind, & makes himself much at home in his corner of the world; indeed he’s one of the people for whom the world was made the shape it is. I wonder whether admiration of one’s own family is snobbish, or somehow the product of love: he seems to love Dorothy & Henry in this particular way."
1920.04.20,"Saw the birth of Ka’s son in the Times this morning, & feel slightly envious all day in consequence. To the Bach choir last night; but one of our failures. Is it the weather? I’d made out on waking, such a perfect day; & one by one my events missed fire. Such a good morning’s writing I’d planned, & wasted the cream of my brain on the telephone. Then the weather; great bouncing gusts all set about with rain soaking one; buses crowded; left typewriting paper in the bus; a long time waiting at the Club—then Bach unaccompanied isn’t easy—though at last (after L. had gone home) I was swept up to the heights by a song. Anna Magdalena’s song. I walked a few steps beyond Herbert Fisher coming out; followed him across the empty lamplit purlieus of Westminster, saw him step so distinguished, yet to my eye, so empty, into Palace Yard, & so to take part in ruling the Empire. His head bent—legs a little wavering—small feet—I tried to put myself inside him, but could only suppose he thought in an exalted way which to me would be all bunkum. Indeed, I feel this more & more. I’ve had my dive into their heads & come out again, I think.

I forgot to say how Hussey came on Sunday uninvited, & we took her to Margaret’s, & she talked such Stracheyese that I couldn’t think much of what she said. Binding Hope now. The books I chose were Berkeley; Maynard; & now they’ve sent Tchehov’s letters, & Barbellion. Never had so few to review—none from The Times (A.B.W⁠[alkley]. perhaps responsible?) none from the Athenaeum; but I’ve plenty to do all the same."
1920.04.24,"Half blind with writing notices, & corrections in 160 copies of Paris, a Poem, by Hope Mirrlees. Then I’ve read some Berkeley, whom I much admire, & would like to catch the trick in his style—only I fear its thinking. Reading Maynard too—a book that influences the world without being in the least a work of art: a work of morality, I suppose. Morgan came for a night. Very easy going; as sensitive as a blue butterfly. So I was pleased to write in his birthday book which is one of his tests of niceness. And he’s obstinate about ‘niceness’—much of a puritan. Tells the truth. I wish I could write his talk down.

I must now write a postcard. Yes, I must really catch the first post if possible. I’ll take it myself—Is there time still—I’ll tell you what it is. The seat is being painted. The boy is so stupid he’ll paint it after its been rained upon. Then it will be ruined.

Nonsense said L. it wont hurt it.

But are you sure? Positive.

Oh then I’ll let it alone—if you’re quite sure. My mother is having the seat painted green. She wouldn’t let me do it, & the boy is dreadfully stupid. I found him putting on the paint without having scraped the old paint off first. &c …

This is very like Morgan; so too his reliance on Leonard. “Where d’you get your boots? Are Waterman pens the best.
"
1920.05.05,"We have had a Thursday to Tuesday at Rodmell; which accounts, as I say, making my apology to this book, in which so few pages seem to have been written. As we sat down to dinner on Saturday, Desmond rapped at the door—To follow this up to its source, I should describe dinner at 46: Desmond, Lytton & Mary there; but I don’t much like describing dinners at 46. Desmond (this is L.’s saying not mine, & I quote it to avoid speaking grudgingly myself) produces a sense of frowst in the room. It rained; he lay back, smoking cigarettes eating sweets & opening novels which he never read. Being an editor has drugged the remnants of ambition in him, & he is now content. Content is disillusioning to behold: what is there to be content about? It seems, with Desmond now, always afternoon.

We worked at Kot’s book. Have I left him out too? His clasp of the hand crushes the little bones: his hand though inches thick is hard as bone, & typifies that dense, solid, concentrated man. He always speaks the truth, & gropes after it in psychology—rather a queer thing to do, & laying waste many a fair garden. As he says a thing, it sounds so convincing. We are publishing Gorki, & perhaps this marks some step over a precipice—I don’t know. He analysed Murry in this devastating way. K. is back I suppose; & I amuse myself with playing at the silly game—who’s to take the first step: I predict here that perhaps Murry will—if not, we dont meet for a year or two.

But hurry on to the climax—Massingham has offered Leonard Brailsford’s post on the Nation—to do the foreign article that is, drawing £400 a year. The drawback is that it means going up every Monday, perhaps Wednesdays, thus ties us tight. If this can be arranged, all else is satisfactory. He could drop his reviewing; do better work; get better pay; & perhaps—my private aim is to drop my reviewing too. But that doesn’t matter. I own I like a good compliment to L.: not boastfully; it seems right, I suppose. So now our fortunes look up again. Lytton dined here last night, & seemed confident, happy,—about to begin on Vic. in earnest. Chatto & Windus must have notice in order that they may lay in large stocks of paper in time."
1920.05.08,"Massingham has postponed seeing L. which may mean that there’s some obstacle. Thinking it over, I shouldn’t be sorry if it fell through; for I cant help suspecting that work of this kind means more of a tie than any money—all the gold of Peru poured into my lap as Miss Mitford says—could repay. Besides, why should I slip the collar round his neck & myself spring free? Partly owing to Lytton, partly to the horror of writing 1, 2, 3, 4, reviews on end, 3 concerning Mitford too, I’ve been groaning & grumbling, & seeing myself caged, & all my desired ends—Jacob’s Room that is—vanishing down avenues. But 1 review weekly won’t hurt.

On Wednesday, Walter [Lamb], Adrian & Karin, & Molly Hamilton dined here. A chattering random vivacious evening: I cant remember any scrap of dialogue though. Perhaps with Molly & Karin that’s inevitable: Karin deaf of the ears, Molly a little obtuse in the senses. I observe that she scrupulously makes conversation to fill silences with; even though she’s nothing to say. Odd to me that life should require ‘professional women’. She is reading 500 novels, at 5/- each, for a prize competition; & had a batch of sickly stuff to masticate in the train going home. We discussed politics, A. & I trying to make her define her position; which is visionary. She is bored by the means, but believes in the end. I suppose she’ll be Hamilton M.P. one of these days; but the elections go badly for women, & Labour fights shy of them.

Yesterday I had tea with Saxon at the Club; &, remembering old lonely evenings of my own, when the married couple seemed so secure & lamplit, asked him back to dinner. I wonder though whether his loneliness ever frightens him as mine used to frighten me. I daresay office work is a great preservative."
1920.05.11,"It is worth mentioning, for future reference, that the creative power which bubbles so pleasantly on beginning a new book quiets down after a time, & one goes on more steadily. Doubts creep in. Then one becomes resigned. Determination not to give in, & the sense of an impending shape keep one at it more than anything. I’m a little anxious. How am I to bring off this conception? Directly one gets to work one is like a person walking, who has seen the country stretching out before. I want to write nothing in this book that I dont enjoy writing. Yet writing is always difficult.

L. is up in London seeing his constituents. Eight gentlemen are waiting on him to learn his views. Then he’s having tea with Kot. He has a meeting (I think) won’t be home till late. I spent the afternoon typing & setting up Morgan’s story. Went out to buy a bun, called on Miss Milan about the chair covers, & when I’ve done this, I shall read Berkeley. At 2.15 Lady Cynthia Curzon was married to Captain Mosley. Though it was summer till 3.30, it is now brushed with blackness, & I must shut the window & put on my jersey. Nessa comes back on Friday. Clive & Mary are in Paris. Then, I had tea with A. & K. on Sunday & saw all the children—Judith a great lump of a child; Ann with a look of the Watts’ drawing of mother; yet both a good deal like Costelloes. I like coming back to Richmond after Gordon Sqre. I like continuing our private life, unseen by anyone. Murry has asked me to write stories for the Athenaeum. No mention of K⁠[atherine]’s wishing to see me."
1920.05.13,"I open this in order to say that I had tea with Dora at the Club & was introduced to Mr Harold Banks. Who is he? Well, all the voices of the world will thunder in reply Banks! Thats his view of it anyhow. Figure a sandy florid broad faced man; talking with an American (really Australian) accent. Shirt with black lines. A pleasant smile. Eating steadily. Dora provided bread & butter. ‘No thank you I don’t smoke …’ “What is your plan exactly Mr Banks?” To tide over the revolution by the cooperation of the middle classes … Yes, but thats a little vague—A great many people wish to do that but—Well I’m here to do it Mrs Sanger—I don’t want to talk about my Russian experiences. I want to see whether I can get the middle classes with me. If not, I go to Scotland & speak in the streets—A very good idea, I’m sure—but what are you going to say? We want a change of government, Mrs Sanger—So many of us feel—Ah, but you English do nothing. You English & the French hold up the whole European movement. When the revolution comes—And when will it come? Within 5 years—you don’t believe it?

But why not write this down? I don’t believe in writing. I talk to the people. Organisation. Cooperation. Middle classes. The people. I shall do it—I’m going to do it. Organisation—There ought not to be a single horse in the streets—Look at your docks—Then these buildings ought to be turned into homes—What can we do without—The middle classes should come together—I’ve the programme ready—& Revolution is coming without a doubt.

Why do I disbelieve in Revolution—partly because of Mr Banks perhaps."
1920.05.15,"Accurately described, today is a fine spring day, not a hot summer day—so L. & I shaded it off, walking up to the Park this afternoon. But Richmond on fine Saturdays is like a lime tree in full flower—suppose one were an insect sitting on the flower. All the others swarm & buzz, & burble. Being residents we don’t, of course.

A letter from Madge this morning, asking me to review her novel: a letter from Fisher Unwin offering to give me a copy. Such is the morality of a woman who won’t pollute her sons by staying at Charleston. I meant to say how we sat on the grass above the cedars & watched the deer; how I noticed the semi-transparent beauty of a parasol in the sun—how the air has this tenderness now that coloured dresses seem to glow in it. A long flattering review of me in the Nation, wiping out Massingham’s bitterness, & giving me my first taste of intelligent criticism, so I’m set up—even contemplate thanking the writer.

Flora & George dined here last night, ostensibly to discuss Clara [Woolf], really to tell us the simple fact that she’s going to America, & may stay there permanently. Can one imagine anything less desirable than to be a person who may stay permanently in America—& its hoped she does. The slightness of human relations often appals me. One doesn’t mind in the least whether she disappears for ever. This doesn’t apply to everyone I admit. I’m a little fidgety because Nessa hasn’t rung me up—probably she came back last night. I liked George more than I expected. A sandy salty looking youth, unambitious, lean, humorous, decided, content to be a schoolmaster for ever, so long as he doesn’t become headmaster. He talked about Sussex, the small owls, & the long eared owls; also the war; he was through it all; never wounded, & saw Damascus. He said the men are very unselfish but boring, because they can talk on so few subjects. How nice, I often think, normal people are!"
1920.05.18,"Gordon Square begins again & like a snake renews its skin outworn—that’s the nearest I can come to a quotation. Gordon Square different—like a looking glass version of 46. You are let in, by a strange servant, go up bare steps, hear children crying at various stages, go up & up—till you reach what is, in the real Gordon Square, servants bedrooms—There’s an open door to be passed first, though, & Sophie inside, & one who, beneath a weight of flesh & bone proved to have the body of Annie Chart in her. Nessa is right at the top. Well we talked till I left at 8; interrupted though by Lytton, Angelica, & Julian. When Stella came back from Italy there were always a great many presents. So now I was given a hat, a brooch, & paper. Lytton said that James & Alix are to be married in 3 weeks. So after all, she has won. But though satisfactory, I find no excitement in this. They know each other too well to stir one’s imagination thinking of their future, as one does with most engagements. Then, talk talk; & as we were despatching the superficial & reaching the easy-intimate, I had to tear off, in the rain, to Wigmore Hall. Sat between Oliver & Saxon; & these musical people dont listen as I do, but critically, superciliously, without programmes.

Today Campbell has been to lunch. Told stories of Palestine. I like thinking I hear men speaking alone. How his general taught him to ride. “No need to say elk elk—you’re not talking to a canary.” C. dresses like a gentleman, & L. could say to him that he believed nothing without making him deny it. Little romance about the church: then I don’t see how they go through with it. How get through the service?—for you can’t gibe at God as one does at an editor—The worst of it must be that there’s no shop about God—I suppose not at least. Logan came on Sunday, & amused me for an hour. Told us about Christ, & his travels—but if you’re not amused by Logan, you’re irritated. So, alas, we begin to find; since his book flags & we run risk of losing money by it. A bad review in the Times, another in Athenaeum; no rush of orders. Hope dribbles along, but she is a negligeable matter."
1920.05.20,"I’m filling my empty tank as fast as I can—for some reason, I’ve been in after tea lately, too lazy to read Greek, & rejected by the Times, though not by the Woman’s Times, by the by. A light article needed on Psychology of War Widows. All the burden & glory of reviewing falls on L. & I get on with Jacob—the most amusing novel writing I’ve done, I think; in the doing I mean. Up yesterday with peonies to Nessa; heard of the mysterious letters from the grave (but this story isn’t recorded—her maids disasters) also the money difficulties which threaten Maynard & through him, her. Gambling on the exchange is the technical name of it, & things rising for the moment, he loses. The question is how long he can hold out; triumph certain in the end, a crash that is. The war has put its skeleton fingers even into our pockets.

Then I went on with L. to dine with the Coles in Chelsea— The Coles are Webbs in embryo—with differences of course. I’m used to being at ease with clever young men, & to find myself stumped, caught out, leg before the wicket at every turn is not pleasant. Never was there such a quick, hard, determined young man as Cole; covering his Labour sympathies, which are I suppose intellectual, with the sarcasm & sneers of Oxford. Then there’s a bust of W⁠[illiam]. Morris on the side board, too much to eat, Morris curtains, all the works of all the classics, & Cole & Mrs hopping on the surface like a couple of Cockney sparrows incapable of more than pecks & sips which they do too skilfully for my taste. The whole effect as of electric light full in the eyes—unbecoming at my age. I think the irritation rose partly from a sense that his cleverness was inaccessible. Then they call each other ‘darling’. Then there were Mr & Mrs Mair, from Government offices, jokes about Beveridge & Shaw, & David Mair subsiding into complete silence in the background till taken home by his broad browed, loquacious wife in the rag⁠[g]⁠ed [?] petticoat. One can see Mrs Cole rapidly becoming the cleverish elderly fox terrier type of intellectual woman—as it is not a shade or valley in her mind. Cole, grinning like a gutterpipe demon took us to the door—so spry, alert, virile, & ominous.

I have written to Katherine. No answer. Mr Lynd reviewed me in the Nation."
1920.05.24,"A real Bank Holiday—blazing weather—sound of buses unceasing—crowds like queues in the streets—& we spent it properly going to Hurlingham to see polo, of which I must make this rapid note. You get the impression that the turf is india rubber—so lightly do the horses spring—touching it & up again—Captain Lockit galloping down with his stick like a Persian rider with a lance. A large white ball is then thrown in the midst. The horses twirl & dart, dance their paws, twist on their tails like cats; almost like long lean cats their scamper after the ball; only as they come past you hear a roar in the nostrils. But the bounce & agility of them all knotted together pawing the ball with their feet indescribable; passing in a second from full gallop to delicate dribbling trot as the ball is dribbled almost between their feet. This is the game of the officers of England. Each had 8 ponies, & one lasted in this frenzy of freshness only 7 minutes. Anyhow it was well worth seeing. A very large ground. The elect in a shelter; public squatting on grass, or on chairs. The horses become suddenly big when they gallop straight at you & their pace alarming. At a little distance the most graceful & controlled of movements.

Summer has set in two days ago. Yesterday for the first time we lunched out of doors. The Swedes came. Affable conversation. She a painter, a cool friendly Scandinavian, highly enlightened; but I suppose there’s some lack of temperament in the enlightened races."
1920.05.26,"Running through this I see I’ve left out one or two important pieces in the mosaic. Massingham has written to ask L. to act as 2nd string in the foreign dept, during vacations, which we interpret to mean that Goldie has taken the 1st string. This suits us on the whole better than t’other. Then L. has been adopted as the Labour candidate of the 7 Universities; may even be writing his letter of acceptance upstairs now. We are having the kitchen re-built at a cost of £80 at Monks House. And the night Morgan & Nessa dined here we saw a fire. Three minutes of excitement—great flames shooting up behind the playground; then a glow as of red yellow gauze, with sparks rising & falling; then a lovely sight when the hose shot into the air, wrapping itself in light & soaring like a rocket. A pouring crackling noise all the time, & now & then wood crashing in. L. went out; & many people came trotting along in mackintoshes; 12 o’clock being struck. The woman next door, wife of the fire-captain, rushed off distracted, & came home in tears, (so the servants say—they sat up, of course). And then I’m reviewed in the New Republic with high praise—indeed no blame. Is this typical of America—more cordial to the English than we are to ourselves? This morning Katherine writes a stiff & formal note thanking me for my kind post card, & saying she will be delighted to see me, though ‘grown very dull’. What does this mean—she hurt with me? Anyhow I go on Friday to find out, unless stopped as is always possible. I praised her story warmly; sincerely too."
1920.05.31,"Back from Monk’s an hour ago, after the first week end—the most perfect, I was going to say, but how can I tell what week ends we mayn’t spend there? The first pure joy of the garden I mean. Wind enough outside; within sunny & sheltered; & weeding all day to finish the beds in a queer sort of enthusiasm which made me say this is happiness. Gladioli standing in troops: the mock orange out. Kitchen wall battered down. We were out till 9 at night, though the evening was cold. Both stiff & scratched all over today; with chocolate earth in our nails. Then the halt has started again; we went into Lewes for the first time since the war. Gunn rode across the level crossing with his great bob tailed dog. The Thomases were on the platform: poor little draggle tail sisters, scarcely holding to their ladyhood any longer. Thomas affable & kindly to the men, telling them, in a sermonical voice, about the water spout at Louth. “Very se-e-erious, many lives lost, & a quarter of a million damage”, as if to conciliate them; no teeth in his upper jaw. Gunn cantered through the water meadows, his mare ‘very clever at the gates, but she won’t stand still’ as the Miss T.’s said, these things interesting them more than water spouts.

I had my interview with K.M. on Friday. A steady discomposing formality & coldness at first. Enquiries about house & so on. No pleasure or excitement at seeing me. It struck me that she is of the cat kind: alien, composed, always solitary & observant. And then we talked about solitude, & I found her expressing my feelings, as I never heard them expressed. Whereupon we fell into step, & as usual, talked as easily as though 8 months were minutes—till Murry came in with a pair of blue & pink Dresden candle pieces: “How very nice” she said. “But do fetch the candles.” “Virginia, how awful what am I to say? He has spent £5 on them” she said, as he left the room. I see that they’re often hostile. For one thing—Murry’s writing. “Did you like C. & A.?” No, I didn’t. “Neither did I. But I thought D. of an I. too dreadful—wrong—Its very very difficult, often…” Then Murry came back. We chatted as usual. Aldous was our butt. Aldous has brought out Leda: will the public canonise him too? But Murry going at length, K. & I once more got upon literature. Question of her stories. This last one, Man without a T., is her first in the new manner. She says she’s mastered something—is beginning to do what she wants. Prelude a coloured post card. Her reviews mere scribbling without a serious thought in them. And Sullivan’s praise in the A⁠[thenaeum]. detestable to her. A queer effect she produces of someone apart, entirely self-centred; altogether concentrated upon her ‘art’: almost fierce to me about it, I pretending I couldn’t write. “What else is there to do? We have got to do it. Life—” then how she tells herself stories at night about all the lives in a town. “Its a spring night. I go down to the docks—I hear the travellers say—” acting it in her usual way, & improvising. Then asked me to write stories for the A. “But I don’t know that I can write stories” I said, honestly enough, thinking that in her view, after her review of me, anyhow, those were her secret sentiments. Whereupon she turned on me, & said no one else could write stories except me—Kew [Gardens] the right ‘gesture’; a turning point—Well but Night & Day? I said, though I hadn’t meant to speak of it.

‘An amazing achievement’ she said. Why, we’ve not had such a thing since I don’t know when—,

But I thought you didn’t like it?

Then she said she could pass an examination in it. Would I come & talk about it—lunch—so I’m going to lunch; but what does her reviewing mean then?—or is she emotional with me? Anyhow, once more as keenly as ever I feel a common certain understanding between us—a queer sense of being ‘like’—not only about literature—& I think it’s independent of gratified vanity. I can talk straight out to her."
1920.06.05,"Here we are in the prime of the year which I’ve thought of so often in January & December, always with pleasure; so that even if June’s bad, one has had more pleasure from it than from all the other months. Is that cynical? What I believe is that one brings out the taste of the month one’s in by opposing to it another. But to think of December now gives me no pleasure. I’ve gone back into winter clothes; its bitter windy; & the sun sparks & glints instead of burning. It burnt on Derby day though [Wednesday 2 June]—the day I lunched with K.M. & had 2 hours priceless talk—priceless in the sense that to no one else can I talk in the same disembodied way about writing; without altering my thought more than I alter it in writing here. (I except L. from this). We talked about books, writing of course: my own. N. & D. a first rate novel, she said. The suppression in it puzzling, but accounted for by circumstances. Then I said ‘You’ve changed. Got through something;’ indeed theres a sort of self command about her as if having mastered something subterfuges were no longer so necessary. She told me of her terrific experiences last winter—experience of loneliness chiefly; alone (or only with ‘Leslie Moor’ alias Ida Baker) in a stone house with caverns beneath it into which the sea rushed: how she lay on bed alone all day with a pistol by her; & men banged at the door. Sydney wrote ‘Stick it out’ twice, underlined. Murry sent a balance sheet of his accounts: came at Christmas with plum pudding & curd cheese; ‘Now I’m here, its all right’. Then she went to him for assurance; didn’t get it; & will never look for that particular quality again. I see what she means, vaguely. She is nervous about her book coming out; fearing lest she hasn’t done enough. What she feels exactly for fame & criticism, I don’t know; but then in our perhaps too exalted talk, this is not very exactly told. Anyhow, I enjoyed myself; & this fragmentary intermittent intercourse of mine seems more fundamental than many better established ones.

I dined last night with Walter Lamb & Mrs Madan at Hounslow. In this old manor house (cream coloured & black) Miss Arnold used to lie drunk. The high rooms are mostly panelled, or papered with Chinese papers. Outside there is a square garden, all its hair flowing in the wind. It was a cold night, & poor Mrs M. crouched in one room, near the flaring grass, supported by rich volumes, apparently not reading, nor sewing, nor talking, her husband away, & the people of Hounslow vicious & hostile. A kind of echo of great luxury everywhere, as becomes the daughter of Mrs Saxton Noble. Much talk of royalties, she & W. moving in the same sphere. One Princess, Marie Louise, lodges, for months now, in Kent House, & has driven away Mr & Master Noble. She keeps royal state with a maid of honour. The atmosphere of this struck me greatly; the unreality. Then her efforts to join the King’s private view of the R.A. Something 18th century in it; a taste of patrons & back stair intrigue. Mrs M. was a sharp shrewd unpretentious young woman, going to have a baby, entirely fed on chopped hay, I should guess, but not servile; only not happy, & never will be, I suppose, since one could detect that her husband filled no important place. They started life in this Hounslow farm 10 months ago. “But what a splendid beginning for married life!” I said. “Indeed it isn’t!” she replied. Geoffrey had gone off, & taken the key of the port. The discomfort of the third rate (W.L. that is) became acute before the evening was over; like something out of tune. Something slate grey & furtive among innocent leaves."
1920.06.08,"It is quite right to think of June in December, save that its a little over-fresh today, almost as if there were Brighton sea round the corner. One of my field days yesterday—National Gallery—there met Clive—ices at Gunters—much of a spectacle—old black & white lady with a confidante observing manners & customs, benevolently, amused. Young man with a back like a clothes’ horse hung with perfect grey clothes—lithe women or girls with transparent legs tripping down into the shady caves—ices sucked or sipped in the strangest silence—two young ladies with their mother eating in complete silence: not a spark of life, properly dressed, from the country perhaps. But don’t mothers & daughters ever talk? Would a young man have waked them? I could not say what went forward in those mute minds. Dine with Nessa. The whole story of Mary was told me—a complete case of servant’s hysteria; all coming, I think, from her wishing to act a day dream, & then, poor creature, stepping too far & believing it, & now babbling in St Paneras Infirmary. The sight of her taken off was sinister; & all the servants were looking from all the windows. What horrid people they are! This made my drive to Waterloo on top of a bus very vivid. A bright night; with a fresh breeze. An old beggar woman, blind, sat against a stone wall in Kingsway holding a brown mongrel in her arms & sang aloud. There was a recklessness about her; much in the spirit of London. Defiant—almost gay, clasping her dog as if for warmth. How many Junes has she sat there, in the heart of London? How she came to be there, what scenes she can go through, I can’t imagine. O damn it all, I say, why cant I know all that too? Perhaps it was the song at night that seemed strange; she was singing shrilly, but for her own amusement, not begging. Then the fire engines came by—shrill too; with their helmets pale yellow in the moonlight. Sometimes every thing gets into the same mood; how to define this one I don’t know—It was gay, & yet terrible & fearfully vivid. Nowadays I’m often overcome by London; even think of the dead who have walked in the city. Perhaps one might visit city the churches. The view of the grey white spires from Hungerford Bridge brings it to me: & yet I can’t say what ‘it’ is."
1920.06.17,"Today is Cup day at Ascot; which I think marks the highest tide of the finest societies greatest season—all superlatives that mean little to me—save as I catch the hum of wheels in Piccadilly on a fine afternoon, & passing carriages look in & see powdered faces like jewels in glass cases. One must be young to feel the stir of it. We are on the road to Ascot. Open taxis go past; or motor cars like engines on the Great Western Railway. Yet the fine weather gives us too our sudden acceleration: dinner parties; memoir club; invitations; coming one on top of another. And now I cannot describe Mrs Mirrlees, & my dinner at the Rubens Hotel, in the heart of a rich warm hearted British family, untouched in any way since 100 years ago. Civilisation having produced that organism, stereotyped it. Booths are of the same species. I wonder whether its natural for families to keep together. I didn’t wonder, though, that night. Unlimited silver flowed out of Sneezer’s pockets.

Next day I lunched at Gordon Sqre for Roger’s show: got stuffed in the head with wine & talk & sat there not very comfortably. A toast to Roger missed fire somewhat—so, I fear, do the pictures, which fill 3 rooms garishly, as with coloured sheets of tin, not one being yet bought. Lytton & I stood in a window, & looked (at least I looked) at a woman brushing her hair, high up in some by street, & silence descended. “Is there enough to say?” Lytton asked, referring to my gay life. I said no. It scarcely went round. Then he told me how he lived for ambition; he wants influence not fame; not Maynard’s influence, but the influence of some old gentleman on whose 80th birthday people present addresses—he wants to deal little words that poison vast monsters of falsehood. This I declared to be unattainable. But I believe it to be what he wishes. Tea at Gunters; dinner at Nessa’s; & so home, a little bruised about the lips, thirsty for a great draught of solitude, which was not given me; since we dined next with the Murrys, next with Roger, & last night had the Memoir Club here, of which I’m too sleepy to give any notice. Leonard is dining with the Society, which I believe I enjoy more than he does, since I shall lie in the shallow light waiting for him; then he will come in; then I shall hear the gossip."
1920.06.23,"I lay in the shallow light, which should be written dark, I think, a long time, & then Moore came & took a cold bath at 1 in the morning, consequently I was too muddled next morning to follow his explanation of Berkeley. He has grown grey, sunken, toothless perhaps. His eyes small, watchful, but perhaps not so piercing as of old. A lack of mass, somewhere. He went off to take ‘my baby for a walk’. I dont see altogether why he was the dominator & dictator of youth. Perhaps Cambridge is too much of a cave. Yet (I don’t attempt to balance this properly) of course there’s his entire innocency & shrewdness; not the vestige of falsehood obscuring him anywhere.

I was struggling, at this time to say honestly that I don’t think Conrad’s last book a good one. I have said it. It is painful (a little) to find fault there, where almost solely, one respects. I cant help suspecting the truth to be that he never sees anyone who knows good writing from bad, & then being a foreigner, talking broken English, married to a lump of a wife, he withdraws more & more into what he once did well, only piles it on higher & higher, until what can one call it but stiff melodrama. I would not like to find The Rescue signed Virginia Woolf. But will anyone agree with this?—anyhow nothing shakes my opinion of a book—nothing—nothing. Only perhaps if its the book of a young person—or of a friend—no, even so, I think myself infallible. Haven’t I lately dismissed Murry’s play, & exactly appraised K.’s story, & summed up Aldous Huxley, & doesn’t it somehow wound my sense of fitness to hear Roger mangling these exact values? Poor Roger has only sold 3 or 4 sketches. There the innumerable pictures hang, like ugly girls at a dance, & no one bids a penny piece. According to Nessa, he can talk of nothing else, & they’re at their wits ends to say the right things—since what is to be said, save that bad pictures don’t sell?

I had one of my last teas at 5 Windmill Hill on Sunday, & though it was the last, it was not very agreeable. (That I see is not the way I mean to put it—but a merry go round playing incessantly distracts me). Emphie I suppose interrupted 10 times. Janet reverted to details of selling furniture & the change to the country as if it weighed on her & she sought by making it all sound nice to convince herself. Then in would pop E. with a tea cup or a plated urn for me to look at. “Then we’ve decided about Cellini & the Bible?” she would ask, which meant more explanations & diversions. I don’t know what I wanted to talk about—anything, I suppose, in preference to what was fairly exactly nothing. Then the level downpour of the rain was depressing too; & didn’t I come home to find that Nelly had declared herself dying, sent for another doctor, & had entirely ruined poor L.’s evening. She’s still in bed, seemingly ill as we were at Xmas; only now cheerful & sensible, & possibly to go home tomorrow, when we go to Monk’s House. Each time one looks forward to that more; & its blazing hot; every plant with a frill of red & white even here; the new kitchen to be seen, all of which I must leave to describe later."
1920.06.29,"Back from Rodmell, which was disappointing, as if held to our lips the cup of pleasure was dashed from them. We started by cutting down the laurel hedge, enthusiastically, clearing a view of the downs. Next morning L.’s arm was bad again, & so it continued, swollen & irritable, rasping every moment that should have been so delicious. The weather brooded heavy too. One day was consumed by Saxon & Barbara. Poor Barbara has the prominent nose & fixed lines of premature maturity. Such a grind & a drudge her life is as fills me with pity—seeing human life a thing to be put through the machine by necessity. For she seemed to have no choice. First Nick, then the child—& all her lines laid down for her for life, by the hand of fate, for she can’t leap them. There she treads her road. Our generation is daily scourged by the bloody war. Even I scribble reviews instead of novels because of the thick skulls at Westminster & Berlin. Saxon was airy & sprightly. The kitchen a success I think, but then I’m not a cook. Home yesterday, to find Lottie with her exaggerated forebodings—Nelly taken worse, & so on, all in an alarmist strain, until having secured her sensation she condescended to details which are not very alarming. But the poor wretches seek to protect themselves from faultfinding by so many prevarications that the truth always cowers close to the ground.

Dinner with Nessa last night. My attempt⁠[s] at sensation were overshadowed by her really great & surprising one—nothing less than the death of a young man at Mrs Russell’s dance. They sat out on the roof, protected by fairy lamps & chairs. He crossed, perhaps to light a cigarette, stepped over the edge, & fell 30 feet onto flagstones. Adrian alone saw the thing happen. He called a doctor sitting there, & very calmly & bravely, so Nessa felt, climbed the wall into the garden where the man had fallen, & helped the Dr over. But there was no hope. He died in the ambulance that fetched him. The dance was stopped. Nessa says the younger generation is callous. No one was upset; some telephoned for news of other dances. Aunt Lou bungled everything with her salt American cheerfulness. It was odd how, sitting high up, one began to get a sense of falling. The man was called Wright, aged 21: for some reason he had his birth certificate on him. Only the girl who brought him knew him. The parents, rich country people, come up, were shown the spot & had nothing to say except, ‘That was where he fell’—but what could they say? Aunt Lou gave her version of the thing ‘not a tragedy—not in the least a tragedy—a stepmother only & seven other children—& its over for him poor boy.’ A strange event—to come to a dance among strangers & die—to come dressed in evening clothes, & then for it all to be over, instantly, so senselessly. Pippa had warned them. No brandy was to be had in any of the three houses."
1920.07.06,"Too much to write as usual, but we work like navvies at binding Morgan, & have no time for frivolity. Festivities get wedged in where convenient. All this comes of choosing a paper that has to be enforced with a lining. It looks as though Morgan might boom, though I dont, as a critic, see altogether what the reason is. And am I a critic? Take Conrad’s book. We were at the first Athenaeum lunch—a long single file of insignificant brain workers eating bad courses. Katherine was opposite, & I heard her enthusiastically praising this very book. At last, appealed to, I confessed my perversity, whereupon she hedged—so did I. But which is right? I still maintain that I’m the true seer, the one independent voice in a chorus of obedient sheep, since they praise unanimously. They always begin that when the plays over—thats my view at least. This lunch was a little dingy & professional, a glimpse into the scullery where the Sullivans & Pounds & Murrys & Huxleys stand stripped with their arms in wash tubs. I see the obvious retort; yet I can’t rid myself of the feeling that if Lytton, Roger, Desmond, Morgan, Nessa, & Duncan had been there the atmosphere would have been less of the area steps & more of the open air. But I’m rather acid about Murry, on account of his writing I think, & Heaven knows, a story by Katherine always manages to put my teeth on edge. My story’s out—hailed by Sydney & Mrs Schiff—its odd how one’s private circle ceases to attend to these outbursts, & how if praise or blame comes its from the public now. Julian here for the week end; & the weather such constant rain as seldom happens; now & then a torrent that sets streams running in 5 minutes."
1920.07.13,"Oh the servants! Oh reviewing! oh the weather! Thus I try to get out of writing my proper account of things. Nelly has vacillated between tears & laughter, life & death for the past 10 days; can’t feel an ache anywhere without sending for me or L. to assure her that aches are not certainly fatal. Then she cries. Never, never, never will she get over it, she says. The doctor comes. Innumerable pills & draughts consumed. Sweats, sleepless nights, recur. My private wonder is, as usual, how they contrive to live a week—aren’t killed by the thunder, like flies. No root in reality is in them; & as for reason, when the mood’s on, as soon might one persuade a runaway horse. And nothing the matter save what one of us would call an upset inside & take a pill for. This drives us to accept invitations, since if anyone comes here, the atmosphere lowers. But where have we been? Indeed I see myself cutting covers incessantly. I don’t think the boom in Morgan will be sudden though. We are advertising in the Nation.

Now for oh Reviewing!—Three weeks I think have passed without a word added to Jacob. How is one to bring it through at this rate. Yet its all my fault—why should I do the Cherry Orchard & Tolstoy for Desmond, why take up the Plumage Bill for Ray? But after this week I do no more. As for the weather, the sun shines in a modified way at this moment; so I will say no more, save that I don’t suppose it will last, or do more than dry the topmost layer of earth upon what must be a swamp. Yet what am I thinking of? That Ka has taken the Eagle’s Nest, & that I wish it were mine.

RODMELL"
1920.08.02,"Bank Holiday. I’m [in] the middle of baking a cake, & fly to this page for refuge, to fill in moments of baking & putting in my bread. Poor wretched book! Thats the way I treat you!—Thats the drudge you are! Still, take comfort from the thought that I brought you all the way from London, to save scribbling on half sheets which get lost. Our season ended unexpectedly; the blind falling with the light still in the sky. If I were not ashamed of my egotism, I could give a literal meaning to my metaphor—seeing that I had to leave Nessa’s great party at 11 in order to be home, not to disturb L., & be ready for packing & going next morning. (now for the cake). Yes, but the cake & the bread between them have made me write nothing for two days—its now Wednesday 4th, & here we are in from shrooming at Asheham—& I with so much to write (& I must keep an eye on the window to prevent Mrs Dedman from finding L. in his bath in the kitchen) that I cant begin.

Well, the great party: to me the time went in tip toe pirouettes; every minute watched, & some alas wasted. There in the corner I sat with Lady S⁠[trachey]. & we talked of my two grandfathers & the Indian Mutiny. She forges about a room like an unwieldy three decker, benignant, yet easily morose, hoarding some grievance against her family, like most old people, for not reading aloud to her, yet easy with strangers. Then Mr Parker the American—alas, when praise is tracked to the source, as often as not it proves brackish—& so was his. Never heard of me save through Potboilers: but my chief pirouetting was with Mary whose hand I took, held, & kissed, on the sofa with Clive on the other side of me. She said she hated & feared me. I wooed her like a wayward child. Does one speak the truth on these occasions, reach it on tiptoe from where it hangs inaccessible in less exalted moments? Then Nina Turton, flushed, lascivious, imbecile, with the heavy idiot voice, as of old, & yet interesting too, as impure women are to the pure—I see her as someone in mid ocean, struggling, diving, while I pace my bank. One may console oneself though by the brainlessness of the exercise. One dip is all that’s needed. Maynard said of her that she’d had more sexual life than the rest of us put together—saw it in her face (here came Mrs Thomsett—& L. stark naked in the kitchen!).

Poor L., utterly driven for a month by Tolstoy & Morgan at last confessed to feeling tired, & was indeed on the verge of destruction. As a hobby, The Hogarth Press is clearly too lively & lusty to be carried on in this private way any longer. Moreover, the business part of it can’t be shared, owing to my incompetence. The future, therefore, needs consideration. This being so, we fled a week earlier than intended, sending Nelly to recover from her vapours, & bring⁠[ing] Lottie down here. On Monday I went up, to say good bye to K.M., was inveigled into a night at 46 & could write many pages on my reflections on sleeping in London again—in Maynard’s bed too. I racked my brain to think who had his room when we lived there—how many years ago? The ease & rapidity of life in London a good deal impressed me—everything near at hand, to be compassed between lunch & tea, without setting out & making a job of it. Roger, Duncan, Nessa, Clive, & so on; I seeing it all much composed & in perspective owing to my outsider’s vision. K.M. asked me to review her book: I cried off on the ground that to review spoils the reading. She as quick as usual to take the point. They are coming to Eastbourne, so my farewell is deferred. Despicable as I am, I find myself liking to hear her underrated by C⁠[live]. & N⁠[essa]. yet protesting as a writer; & finally harbouring one or two doubts, genuine doubts, as to the merits of her stories, since the two lately printed in the A⁠[thenaeum]. have not been good.

And now I can’t write my views of Don Quixote as intended, for I’ve spun my froth off, & have no wits left."
1920.08.05,"Let me try to say what I think as I read Don Quixote after dinner—Principally that writing was then story telling to amuse people sitting round the fire without any of our devices for pleasure. There they sit, women spinning, men contemplative, & the jolly, fanciful, delightful tale is told to them, as to grown up children—This impresses me as the motive of D.Q., to keep us entertained at all costs. So far as I can judge, the beauty, & thought come in unawares; Cervantes scarcely conscious of serious meaning, & scarcely seeing D.Q. as we see him. Indeed that’s my difficulty—the sadness, the satire, how far are they ours, not intended—or do these great characters have it in them to change according to the generation that looks at them? Much, I admit, of the tale-telling is dull—not much, only a little at the end of the first volume, which is obviously told as a story to keep one contented. So little said out, so much kept back, as if he had not wished to develop that side of the matter—the scene of the galley slaves marching is an instance of what I mean—Did C. feel the whole of the beauty & sadness of that as I feel it? Twice I’ve spoken of ‘sadness’. Is that essential to the modern view? Yet how splendid it is to unfurl one’s sail & blow straight ahead on the gust of the great story telling, as happens all through the first part. I suspect the Fernando-Cardino-Lucinda story was a courtly episode in the fashion of the day, anyhow dull to me. I am also reading Ghoa le Simple—bright, effective, interesting, yet so arid & spick & span. With Cervantes everythings there; in solution if you like; but deep, atmospheric, living people casting shadows solid, tinted as in life. The Egyptians, like most French writers, give you a pinch of essential dust instead, much more pungent & effective, but not nearly so surrounding & spacious. By God!—what stuff I’m writing! always these images.

I write Jacob every morning now, feeling each days work like a fence which I have to ride at, my heart in my mouth till its over, & I’ve cleared, or knocked the bar out. (Another image, unthinking it was one. I must somehow get Hume’s Essays & purge myself)."
1920.08.10,"I have spent the whole afternoon yellow washing the earth closet. I can now reckon up my labours: dining room distempered & cleaned; bannisters painted blue; stairs white; & now the earth closet. Tea comes quick; post (with luck) in the middle of tea; then a lounge in the garden; then Mrs Thomsett round with the plates; green shaded lamp lit, & beneath it we sit ostensibly reading till 10.30: when candles are fetched, & we plod yawning up stairs. Our beds have dents & hollows; but we sleep till Mrs Thomsett calls us. She is one of the most punctual. But then Mr Thomsett is out with his cattle at 5. Perhaps it’s his boots that sometimes wake me—The cattle go down to the brooks. Mr Arblaster’s motor car pants under the window.

Coming home from Rat Farm on Sunday, a hot still day, Leonard initiated a scheme for the future of the Press. We are going to offer Partridge a share in it, baiting this perhaps minute titbit with the plumper morsel of secretaryship to L. About the middle of dinner L. developed this further: why not install Partridge at Suffield, & buy a complete printing outfit? Why not? Run a shop there too, perhaps. Ramifications spring unceasingly from this centre. The whole depends, however, upon Partridge, who has been invited here. Its a pleasant thing, come autumn, to make plans. Nelly still mysteriously diseased, & that being so we implore her to stay away—

Reading Don Q. still—I confess rather sinking in the sand—rather soft going—so long as the stories aren’t about him—but has the loose, far scattered vitality of the great books, which keeps me going—

‘Potterism’—by R. Macaulay, a don’s book, hard-headed, masculine, atmosphere of lecture room, not interesting to me—

Catherine Wilmot, who went on a tour in 1802—& kept a diary; but I have not yet got in to her—a necessary process. Now to pick sweet peas."
1920.08.13,"For the first time in memory, I sit down to this page instead of to the sterner one of duty & profit at some minutes after ten a.m. Damn these aristocrats! damn myself for being such a snob—unable to settle to Jacob’s Room because ‘about midday’ Nelly Cecil in her motor car will descend. ‘Driving Bob to Newhaven—may I take bread & cheese with you?’ A dull listless morning, too, a little close in the house, yet chilly perhaps under the acacia; & not a spark of colour glowing. My preparations for the aristocracy—but I wrong myself—Molly Hamilton, or Molly MacCarthy or any other Molly—would cause as much stir—consist in pinning a chair cover together & filling the vases with sweet peas & roses. I dont like these civic interruptions into rural life. I didn’t like the Clutton Brocks at Charleston. London yesterday I hated. More truly it was not London but a certain yard of the line between Richmond & Mortlake where we stopped for an hour & a half—I, too, due at the dentists with the treat of a lounge through my favourite streets afterwards. I wanted to buy some bright piece of china for the mantelpiece. As it was I scoured the town in taxis, lavished florins, accumulated parcels, swallowed tea, encountered Kot, & then spent 20 minutes at Victoria—however, L. was there, & we could chatter. But as the train swung out into open country life seemed fresher, sweeter, saner. One day I must pay a tribute to the humanity of dentists. Better than journalism for the soul, I told L.—but then, I’ve a vendetta with Massingham, against whom my arrow was launched. Its true though: I get more & more disinclined for journalism. I’ve written only half a page of it since coming here—three weeks ago; have refused 3 articles (summing up Jane, Charlotte, & Thackeray) & feel like a drunkard who has successfully resisted three invitations to drink.

Walking with Clive over the instep of Firle Beacon the other night we talked of all this; he seriously advising me for my good to approach America; being, as I always think, an admirable man of business, & doing very well for himself. And we talked about the future of the press & of the novel; he shrewd on both these questions, though perhaps I shall find my own opinions earning good money in his name in America. Through the pheasant wood we came, & by the cornfields; & I made up a sentence about paint with a yellow glaze on it to express the warm deep colours, laid so thickly upon field & down, & overlaid with some varnish so that it glowed, not raw, but under skilful preservation. There was Maynard, Duncan, Nessa; & we broached the new studio, where I sat with the painters all the next morning—talking, talking—till, as I say, the Brocks came, & we turned intelligent & cultured again. I rode home over the fields—one of the few days which are, as I maintain, days: the usual windy rainy weather being the variety & deviation. All being prepared, down to chicken & tongue, Molly H. of course did not come—her mother taking the occasion to fall from a ladder.

By opening the garden door I enlarge our garden so far as Mount Caburn. There I walk in the sunset; when the village climbing the hill has a solemn sheltering look⁠[,] pathetic, somehow, emblematic, anyhow very peaceful & human, as if people sought each others company at night, & lived trustfully beneath the hills. The old whitehaired women sit on the doorstep till 9 or so, then go in; & the light is lit in the upper window & all is dark by ten o’clock. I had reason to observe nocturnal habits last night, for after my recuperative draught was over, Lottie was still not home; & when 10 struck L. determined to go in search. Bicycling alone along a road in ruts in the dark she might well have fallen—& so forth. I went on foot up to the cross roads; thus passing all the men coming back from the public house, & saying more ‘Good nights’ than in a week of daylight—proving what I’ve said of the sociability of nightfall. Then, too, they’d had their lamps lit for them by Mr Malthouse’s beer. Presumably every man in the place spends his evenings in the public house of course; & I should like once in a way to hear their talk. (George Sturgeon, who came with Flora on Sunday, has disillusioned me with country talk—his is all of cricket & tennis—coarse shapes of humanity appearing through the haze, all stamped according to their position in Lewes society—I dont think the intelligentzia need fear, either on earth or in Heaven, the competition of these simple natures—for stupidity, buttressing itself with all the conventions & prejudices is not nearly so humane as we free thinkers are). Then the clover smelt sweet up by the corner; & there was Lewes flashing, truthfully speaking with a kind of diamond brilliance, & the sky all powdered (?) with stars, grey with them, since the moon was not up. L. found Lottie at the level crossing, her bicycle punctured, her lamps out, but hilarious & loquacious as a jay in the sun light."
1920.08.19,"I raise my head from making a patchwork quilt. This is the day of the month when I despatch darning & other needlework, & do in truth more useful work than on days of free intelligence. How shifting & vacillating one’s mind is! Yesterday broody & drowsy all day long, writing easily, & yet without strict consciousness, as though fluent under drugs: today apparently clear headed, yet unable to put one sentence after another—sat for an hour, scratching out, putting in, scratching out; & then read [Sophocles’] Trachiniae with comparative ease—always comparative—oh dear me!

We had Nelly Cecil from 12 till 4.30; and how rude & even slovenly she made our equipment seem! the rooms diminishing, the silver tarnishing, the chicken drying, & the china dulling. It was hard work; one of us always at her ear, & she, poor woman, receiving words from one or other of us incessantly. Beginning on the very outskirts of intimacy we made progress to the centre. To begin with she’s shy, apologetic for the infliction: “I’ll stay one hour—oh I’m interrupting—how you must curse me for breaking in on you!” But this went by & her mind, trained to deal with the political situation kept her alert. We had much gossip too, chiefly about Mrs Asquith & her inaccuracies, how the Tennants broke up the old aristocratic world. So to religion. “I have not so much of it as I used to have. When one was young one wished for immortality. And the war made it difficult—oh yes, I go to church still. Bob leads a good, earnest life, & goes on believing.” Bob is at Deauville with the Mosley’s for a month. Indeed, one guesses at isolation unspeakable; never was there such a look of solitude on any human face as on hers; as if always away from life, alone, forced to bear it, & be grateful for any help. Her body incredibly little & shrunk; eyes slightly fading; cheeks sunk in—"
1920.08.20,"Mrs Dedman cajoled us there by calling it a Sussex funeral, & promising that the bearers would wear smock frocks. But only 6 were to be found in the village; so the plan was given up; Mr Stacey was lowered to his grave by black farm labourers, two of whom managed to tumble into the grave as they lowered him. Smock frocks exist however, as she proved by showing us grandfather’s, & a fine piece of stitchery it is, with a pattern appropriate to Rodmell, distinct from all other villages. He, who now sits on the bench in the churchyard walk, wore it on Sundays. The entire male population of Kingston village came out of church after the coffin; brown faces, white hairs, showing on top of coal black coats. Four or five meagre girls provided with white handkerchiefs which they used automatically, walked first—one poor old thing with a ribbon of black velvet round her throat. The clergy acted with such portentous gloom that even now I daresay they scarcely feel comfortable. Still glowering like a gargoyle one of them sat in his taxi, waiting to go back to Lewes. The day was cold; a thunder shower purple in the sky. As usual, the service seemed chill, awkward, unmanageable; everyone subduing their natural feelings, & seeming to play a part because the others did. The coffin was a pale grey, wreaths attached by strings. Whether the Catholic form is warmer, I know not; a strange convention this. I saw one man shredding a few grains of dust at the right moment. We stood under a yew tree, by a large tomb. But the ceremonial spirit is entirely absent. We never catch fire. Then the awkwardness of old Sunday coats & hats. Kingston is a fine village, with old bow windowed houses, & the path running to the heart of the hill. I feel Sunday clinging to my clothes like the smell of camphor.—cant write, as I perceive with shame, or rather with amusement."
1920.08.25,"For the third time this summer, though no other summer, I went to London [on] Monday, paid 5/- for a plate of ham, & said good bye to Katherine. I had my euphemism at parting; about coming again before she goes; but it is useless to extend these farewell visits. They have something crowded & unnaturally calm too about them, & after all, visits can’t do away with the fact that she goes for two years, is ill, & heaven knows when we shall meet again. These partings make one pinch oneself as if to make sure of feeling. Do I feel this as much as I ought? Am I heartless? Will she mind my going either? And then, after noting my own callousness, of a sudden comes the blankness of not having her to talk to. So on my side the feeling is genuine. A woman caring as I care for writing is rare enough I suppose to give me the queerest sense of echo coming back to me from her mind the second after I’ve spoken. Then, too, there’s something in what she says of our being the only women, at this moment (I must modestly limit this to in our circle) with gift enough to make talk of writing interesting. How much I dictate to other people! How often too I’m silent, judging it useless to speak. I said how my own character seemed to cut out a shape like a shadow in front of me. This she understood (I give it as an example of her understanding) & proved it by telling me that she thought this bad: one ought to merge into things. Her senses are amazingly acute—a long description she gave of hosing plants—putting the hose over the high trees, then over the shrubs, then over the mignonette. And Murry said slowly, “You’ve got it wrong, Katherine. Youth wasn’t like that. At least I’m sure mine wasn’t.” Murry playing tennis all day; an oddly detached couple. She wants to live in an Italian town & have tea with the doctor. It suddenly strikes me as I write that I should like to ask her what certainty she has of her work’s merit.—But we propose to write to each other—She will send me her diary. Shall we? Will she? If I were left to myself I should; being the simpler, the more direct of the two. I can’t follow people who don’t do the obvious things in these ways. I’ve recanted about her book; I shall review it; but whether she really wanted me to, God knows. Strange how little we know our friends.

So I missed my train; & what I wanted most in the world was to catch it & travel back with L.

Nelly is now going to have her teeth seen to. No talk of her coming back yet. I am quite given up as a reviewer—seriously by the Times I believe—& forge ahead with Jacob, which I wager to finish by Xmas."
1920.08.31,"The last day of August—& what a day! November in the city without the lights. Then the schoolchildren singing, & as I write Lottie chatter-chattering—so I’m out of mood. Detestable grey sky—life has too few days to waste them thus. I must walk my temper off upon the downs. But first I’ve Partridge & Carrington to deal with. Another step has been taken in life: we have a partner & a secretary at a cost of £100. Rash, I suppose; but then what’s the point of life if one’s not rash? Anyhow we step out bold⁠[l]⁠y, & if the Press is to live, it had better run a risk or two. The young man, aged 26, just left Oxford, is a superb body—shoulders like tough oak; health tingling beneath his skin. Merry shrewd eyes. Since George Sturgeon I’m shy of stupid young men; but P. hasn’t that stupidity anyhow. He has been religious; is now socialistic; literature I don’t suppose counts for much: he’s written an essay on Milton, which C. was not struck by. Happily we had fine weather; & sat in the meadow & watched Squire & Sassoon play cricket—the last people I wished to see—Somehow that the downs should be seen by cultivated eyes, self conscious eyes, spoils them to me. I wish there were nothing but Dedmans, Bottens & Staceys in the world; as they alone people the graveyards. Carrington is ardent, robust, scatterbrained, appreciative, a very humble disciple, but with enough character to prevent insipidity. A little ashamed of P., I thought her. But what shoulders! what thickness of bone! He is an admirer of L.’s. Well, how will it turn out? What shall we print?

[H. G.] Wells has asked us to stay. What other news is there? The time seems to race ahead, broken into halves by the post; & I’ve such a litter of books to read—though none to review. A cold, disappointing summer. Finished Sophocles this morning—read mostly at Asheham."
1920.09.08,"Perhaps a little author’s egotism may be allowed—simply that I’ve taken the plunge of refusing my books from the Times, & dictated conditions for the future—only leading articles, or those I suggest myself. No answer from Richmond, so I don’t know his view of it. But, of course, far from being rejected he was respecting my holiday, & suggested a list of victims, Murry & Lawrence among them, at the thought of which I shivered & shuddered, & finally decided to run the risk. At this moment I feel it more of a risk than the day before yesterday, as Lytton, Mary, Clive, came here yesterday, discussed immortality; & I find my bid for it is as letter writer. What about poor Jacob then? & hadn’t I better drive my pen through sheets that pay of a morning, in the intervals of writing letters? Oh vanity, vanity! how it grows on me—how detestable it is—how I swear to crush it out—Learn French is the only thing I can think of. Then I didn’t like Mary; scented, tinted, lewd lipped, & blear eyed; & the consciousness that its the mean side of me that feasts on such garbage; & resentment with her for making me feed on garbage; & she saying sharp things & then hard, & I unable to say out loud “Well then, why come & sit on my lawn?” Why does she? And I always break off ‘poor wretch’—yet not quite magnanimously in her case. L. at tea put me right: M.H. is one of the few people I dislike, I said. No: he replied: one of the many you dislike & like alternately—The bread had not risen—I was worried this morning by school children; & I hate people to compare this to the disadvantage of Asheham—M.H. again. Lytton gave me a lesson in simplicity. If anyone has a right to talk of immortality he has with his 9 editions & so on. Yet when L. severely told him he had no chance of that, he did not narrow his eyes, shift his hands, or do anything but look calm & animated. It was an amusing talk. How far has our set justified its promise? Lytton maintains that in ourselves we are as remarkable as the Johnson set, though our works may perish—still we’re still at the beginning of our works. Then came that about Madame de Sevigné: then Duncan given his chance; I compared E⁠[minent].V⁠[ictorians].’s with Macaulay, & thought Lytton perhaps uncertain about Victoria. Maynard says, however, it should succeed better; indeed is better. Much talk of Athenaeum; Lady Blessington; our printing prospects; before they went. Lytton comes on Friday. After all, isn’t he the choicest of us? And now I can go out & look at the downs—where?"
1920.09.15,"Nelly by the way has now had, I suppose every organ in her body examined, & is pronounced healthy with the exception of her teeth. So that shot of mine seems the true one;—but I confess I don’t look forward to the winter. The fact is the lower classes are detestable.

Something of that reflection I owe to Lytton who has been with us from Friday to Tuesday, & now that the rain is come, I observe maliciously, is with the Hutches at Wittering (Never does Mary darken my door, or shadow my lawn again, I observe)—And that too comes from Lytton—its a consequence of walking all along the flats with him, on a brilliant evening, so up by Northease farm onto the downs. His admiration of the place made up for all disparagement. But see how many little facts, sayings, points of view I collected from him—that Mary dislikes me ‘very feminine’, that Clive is a buffoon, that the lower classes are vulgar & stupid, that the Selby Biggs are useless & pretentious, that we only remain—but that the world’s very amusing & pleasant, on the whole, society agreeable, ‘women essential’; & I think there are one or two doubts of his about the value of his work compared with creating a world of one’s own.

Then ‘Life is very complex’—this murmured, as if intimate, referring to his own difficulties, which I had explained to me on the Roman Road. A repetition of Nick & Barbara [Bagenal]. C⁠[arrington]. lives with P⁠[artridge], till Christmas, then comes to a decision. And we walked all the way to Kingston, talking, back over the flats, talking. Save for shadows that cross & leave him ruffled, he is now uniformly amiable, & takes pains at table—so that something is always on foot. At night we had the first two or three chapters of Victoria—Disgraceful to say I was twice overcome with sleep, owing to our wood fire; but the liveliness of it is such as to make one forget whether its good or not. I dont know what qualities it has. I suspect it depends too much upon amusing quotations, & is too much afraid of dulness to say anything out of the way. Not at all a meditative or profound book; on the other hand, a remarkably composed & homogeneous book. I doubt whether these portraits are true—whether thats not too much the conventional way of making history—But I think I’m coloured by my own wishes, & experimental mood. A miracle in the matter of condensation & composition I suspect. But we are to read it when done. Blessed with fine weather, I could look from my window, through the vine leaves, & see Lytton sitting in the deck chair reading Alfieri from a lovely vellum copy, dutifully looking out words. He wore a white felt hat, & the usual grey clothes; was long, & tapering as usual; looking so mild & so ironical, his beard just cut short. As usual; I got my various impressions: of suavity, a gentle but inflexible honesty; lightning speed; something peevish & exacting; something incessantly living, suffering, reflecting moods. Still he can withdraw in that supercilious way that used to gall me; still show himself superior to me, contemptuous of me—of my morality, that is, not of my mind. For my own encouragement, I may note that he praised the Voyage Out voluntarily; “extremely good” it seemed to him on re-reading, especially the satire of the Dalloways. Night & Day he judges better, on the whole. Well, I can walk & talk with him by the hour.

I should have made more of my release from reviewing. When I’d sent my letter to Richmond, I felt like someone turned out into the open air. Now I’ve written another in the same sense to Murry, returning Mallock; & I believe this is the last book any editor will ever send me. To have broken free at the age of 38 seems a great piece of good fortune—coming at the nick of time, & due of course to L. without whose journalism I couldn’t quit mine. But I quiet my conscience with the belief that a foreign article once a week is of greater worth, less labour, & better paid than my work; & with luck, if I can get my books done, we shall profit in moneymaking eventually. And, when one faces it, the book public is more of an ordeal than the newspaper public, so that I’m not shirking responsibility. Now, of course, I can scarcely believe that I ever wrote reviews weekly; & literary papers have lost all interest for me. Thank God, I’ve stepped clear of that Athenaeum world, with its reviews, editions, lunches, & tittle tattle—I should like never to meet a writer again. The proximity of Mr Addison, reputed editor of The Field, is enough for me. I should like to know masses of sensitive, imaginative, unselfconscious unliterary people, who have never read a book—Now, in the rain, up to Dean, to talk about the door of the coal cellar."
1920.09.17,"Oh still in the rain—the green I see through the window has a sulphur tint in it—perhaps the evening sun is sinking behind Falmer—but the rain rains so as to beat the asters to the ground & wet L. through, going & coming from the E.C. We have been into Lewes nevertheless—by train, & walking home with knapsacks. I bought two pairs of stockings, L. a hair brush. We met Mr Thomas at the halt.

Rough weather! said Leonard.

“It is! It is indeed. But then you see, we are already in autumn. And the sea is only three & a half miles away.” This he said nervously & eagerly, like a child; & then came out with his measurement, the fame of which has reached Rodmell already: 250 tons of rain fell the other night. But the harvest is in. What other news is there? L. caught a bat in our bedroom & killed it with a towel. I thought the lime tree was on us last night. We were wakened by a clap of thunder. Lottie spent the night at Charleston. I write this as if it were to be my last chance. Eliot comes tomorrow. We do not look forward lightly: but its interesting, which is always something. I’ve reached the party in Jacob & write with great pleasure."
1920.09.19,"Eliot is separated only by the floor from me. Nothing in mans or womans shape is any longer capable of upsetting me. The odd thing about Eliot is that his eyes are lively & youthful when the cast of his face & the shape of his sentences is formal & even heavy. Rather like a s⁠[c]⁠ulpted face—no upper lip: formidable, powerful; pale. Then those hazel eyes seeming to escape from the rest of him. We talked—America, Ottoline, aristocracy, printing, Squire, Murry, criticism. “And I behaved like a priggish pompous little ass” was one of his comments upon his own manner at Garsington. He is decidedly of the generation beneath us—I daresay superior—younger, though."
1920.09.20,"To go on with Eliot, as if one were making out a scientific observation—he left last night directly after dinner. He improved as the day went on; laughed more openly; became nicer. L. whose opinion on this matter I respect, found him disappointing in brain—less powerful than he expected, & with little play of mind. I kept myself successfully from being submerged, though feeling the waters rise once or twice. I mean by this that he completely neglected my claims to be a writer, & had I been meek, I suppose I should have gone under—felt him & his views dominant & subversive. He is a consistent specimen of his type, which is opposed to ours. Unfortunately the living writers he admires are Wyndham Lewis & Pound.—Joyce too, but there’s more to be said on this head. We had some talk after tea (I put off the Mayors) about his writing. I suspect him of a good deal of concealed vanity & even anxiety about this.) I taxed him with wilfully concealing his transitions. He said that explanation is unnecessary. If you put it in, you dilute the facts. You should feel these without explanation. My other charge was that a rich & original mind is needed to make such psychological writing of value. He told me he was more interested in people than in anything. He cant read Wordsworth when Wordsworth deals with nature. His turn is for caricature. In trying to define his meaning (‘I dont mean satire’) we foundered. He wants to write a verse play in which the 4 characters of Sweeny act the parts. A personal upheaval of some kind came after Prufrock, & turned him aside from his inclination—to develop in the manner of Henry James. Now he wants to describe externals. Joyce gives internals. His novel Ulysses, presents the life of man in 16 incidents, all taking place (I think) in one day. This, so far as he has seen it, is extremely brilliant, he says. Perhaps we shall try to publish it. Ulysses, according to Joyce, is the greatest character in history⁠[.] Joyce himself is an insignificant man, wearing very thick eyeglasses, a little like Shaw to look at, dull, self-centred, & perfectly self assured. There is much to be said about Eliot from different aspects—for instance, the difficulty of getting into touch with clever people.—& so forth—anaemia, self-consciousness; but also, his mind is not yet blunted or blurred. He wishes to write precise English; but catches himself out in slips; & if anyone asked him whether he meant what he said, he would have to say no, very often. Now in all this L. showed up much better than I did; but I didn’t much mind."
1920.09.26,"But I think I minded more than I let on; for somehow Jacob has come to a stop, in the middle of that party too, which I enjoyed so much. Eliot coming on the heel of a long stretch of writing fiction (2 months without a break) made me listless; cast shade upon me; & the mind when engaged upon fiction wants all its boldness & self-confidence. He said nothing—but I reflected how what I’m doing is probably being better done by Mr Joyce. Then I began to wonder what it is that I am doing: to suspect, as is usual in such cases, that I have not thought my plan out plainly enough—so to dwindle, niggle, hesitate—which means that one’s lost. But I think my 2 months of work are the cause of it, seeing that I now find myself veering round to [John] Evelyn, & even making up a paper upon Women, as a counterblast to Mr Bennett’s adverse views reported in the papers. Two weeks ago I made up Jacob incessantly on my walks. An odd thing the human mind! so capricious, faithless, infinitely shying at shadows. Perhaps at the bottom of my mind, I feel that I’m distanced by L. in every respect.

Went to Charleston for the night; & had a vivid sight of Maynard by lamplight—like a gorged seal, double chin, ledge of red lip, little eyes, sensual, brutal, unimaginative: one of those visions that come from a chance attitude, lost so soon as he turned his head. I suppose though it illustrates something I feel about him. Then he’s read neither of my books—In spite of this I enjoyed myself: L. came over next day & found me neither suicidal nor homicidal. Home we rode after their inconvenient early tea—Charleston time, invented by Maynard, being an hour before summer time. Summer time, by the way is extended for a month, owing to the threat of a strike which I say won’t take place. But what do I know?—can’t master these leading articles. Eliot has sent me his poems, & hopes to maintain contact during the winter. This was the text of much discussion at Charleston; & in private, with N⁠[essa]. & D⁠[uncan]. that is, I divulged my intention to deal no more with M.H. They agreed, I think. N. produced further reasons why I should steer clear.

A hot summer day; too hot standing weeding in the sun. L. is clearing the big bed. Lottie goes tomorrow. Nelly is said to be recovered. No doubt Richmond has something to do with it"
1920.10.01,"Here we are at the last day; the boxes with apples standing open—this book left out by mistake, so that I take the opportunity—Yes; undoubtedly the best summer so far, in spite of execrable weather, no bath, one servant, & an E.C. down a winding glade. To that verdict we both set our hands. The place is enchanting, & though in my jealous moods I’ve reconnoitred & scrutinised every other house, on the whole I decide that this is best. Even the schoolchildren’s voices, if one thinks of them as swifts & martins skirling round the eaves, exhilarate instead of annoying. We now give them apples, rejecting their pence, & requiring in return that they shall respect the orchard. They had already stripped several trees. As I say the time has vanished, & we are back before we have been here. Nelly, by the way, returns. I must try to say nothing sharp, though inclined to. After all, without education,—there are excuses.

I have neither written nor read since Monday, owing to a threatening of headache. It was this, not Eliot I suppose, that broke off Jacob. Very slowly the well, so dry last week, seems to be re-filling. I could invent again—But first I must do Evelyn, then, perhaps, Women. I think Richmond will take as many articles from me as necessary—Murry, I notice, answers nothing; neither prints nor returns my story. Are these the manners of the underworld—what I call ‘showing off’? It doesn’t much matter. I had my account from Gerald this morning—a little disappointing, I think—I’ve sold 500 since January—which makes 1600 in all; in 8 months that is. Now it will slack off, & creep very slowly to the 2,000. I don’t very much care—but then, it gets more & more doubtful if I shall make enough money this way. Rowntree has quarrelled with the Contemporary & brought L.’s supplement to an end. We lose £250 a year—& this is the most serious part of it, for the supplement was scarcely worth while in that form. We find ourselves free however—& so speculate about travel—Italy, Greece, France—Oh well, we rummage in the great bran pie very energetically—Why not install Partridge, let Hogarth, & kick up our heels? Nessa—did I say—? has invented Major Grant & his equipage in the basement & thus gets rid of cooks. All houses will be run like this in a few years. And now its clearing: blue sky with ice bergs. I must go & see Mr Botten about sending butter. One of the charms of Rodmell is the human life: everyone does the same thing at the same hour: when the old vicar performs erratically on the bells, after churching the women, everybody hears him, & knows what he’s up to. Everyone is in his, or their garden; lamps are lit, but people like the last daylight, which was brown purple last night, heavy with all this rain. What I mean is that we are a community.

RICHMOND"
1920.10.18,"This is a long break, & perhaps I should not fill it now if it were not that I am in from the Club, & can’t settle to anything. Yet we have been back seventeen days, have seen a number of people, & harboured more thoughts than there are words in my mind for: here L. came in, & told me that Rowntree wants to reconsider the death of the Supplement; will almost certainly keep it on, with a smaller staff. I’m afraid I wasn’t pleased; for here we are tied again, L. accepting £200 instead of £250; & no chance of Italy. We argued, & my fears were said to be foolish; & I daresay they are. Only I’m alarmed, sometimes, to think how easily L. might devote himself to a cause. I do my utmost to ruin his career.

Who have we seen? The usual people, Nessa & Duncan Clive Mary Stracheys Stephens, Ka, Arnold Forsters,—Kot, too, who came to bring us Tchehov, & was so excited over it & other projects as to twang like a fiddle, instead of solemnly resounding as usual like a full barrel of beer. We are well launched upon the work of the Press. Partridge—Ralph I should call him—is putting his ox’s shoulder to the wheel, & intends to do “hurricane” business. We are bringing out Three Stories by L.: my book; (printed for an experiment by McDermott;) & have in view Tchehov, Eliot, Roger, possibly Lytton’s essays; & now little priggish Mervyn A.F. wishes to employ us to print his ‘rhymes’,—which will be bad, but it is amusing to sell our skill."
1920.10.25,"Why is life so tragic; so like a little strip of pavement over an abyss. I look down; I feel giddy; I wonder how I am ever to walk to the end. But why do I feel this? Now that I say it I don’t feel it. The fire burns; we are going to hear the Beggars Opera. Only it lies about me; I can’t keep my eyes shut. It’s a feeling of impotence: of cutting no ice. Here I sit at Richmond, & like a lantern stood in the middle of a field my light goes up in darkness. Melancholy diminishes as I write. Why then don’t I write it down oftener? Well, one’s vanity forbids. I want to appear a success even to myself. Yet I dont get to the bottom of it. Its having no children, living away from friends, failing to write well, spending too much on food, growing old—I think too much of whys & wherefores: too much of myself. I dont like time to flap round me. Well then, work. Yes, but I so soon tire of work—can’t read more than a little, an hour’s writing is enough for me. Out here no one comes in to waste time pleasantly. If they do, I’m cross. The labour of going to London is too great. Nessa’s children grow up, & I cant have them in to tea, or go to the Zoo. Pocket money doesn’t allow of much. Yet I’m persuaded that these are trivial things: its life itself, I think sometimes, for us in our generation so tragic—no newspaper placard without its shriek of agony from some one. McSwiney this afternoon & violence in Ireland; or it’ll be the strike. Unhappiness is everywhere; just beyond the door; or stupidity which is worse. Still I dont pluck the nettle out of me. To write Jacob’s Room again will revive my fibres, I feel. Evelyn is done: but I don’t like what I write now. And with it all how happy I am—if it weren’t for my feeling that its a strip of pavement over an abyss."
1920.11.10,"I have walked some way further along the strip of pavement without falling in. Business has kept me stepping out briskly, & then, making an effort, I bought a coat & skirt, & began my social winter at Mrs Samuel Bruce’s, between Katie & Elena again, again hearing the same things, & saying the same things. Nelly Cecil spent the night with us, honest, humble, shabby, distinguished. The only people she likes are writers; her own friends she despises a little. De la Mare & Mary Coleridge she respects. Nessa’s room at Gordon Square is becoming what the drawing room at 46 was 5 or 6 years ago. I go there & find that astonishing brightness in the heart of darkness. Julian coming in with his French lesson; Angelica hung with beads, riding on Roger’s foot; Clive claret coloured & yellow like a canary; Duncan vague in the background, sitting astride a chair, looking with blurred eyes rather dimly. Then we dined with Roger, & with the Sturgeons, & altogether I sometimes feel that not to have a refuge here would be a bad thing—I don’t know. Ralph hints at a plan of sharing a London house with us—which tempts me, on some days. All three of us set up L.’s story this afternoon. I’ve been writing to finish my book; & not a word set to Jacob yet; & I must prepare a chapter for the memoir club; & so, in spite of no reviewing, I don’t do as I planned. The house now runs very smoothly, indeed melodiously. Didn’t I have tea off Nelly’s butter? days fly as usual; & I’m writing a story to ask why—

L. at work on a book for Snowden: endlessly reviewing too; no news yet from Rowntree about the supt. & that reminds me of the pickle I got into over Evelyn in the Lit. Supt. last week. 4 mistakes in 4 columns."
1920.11.13,"This book is badly treated again; & I forget what my excuses are—no desire to write in it the chief I expect. Now I’ve finished the Symposium [Plato] I may relent perhaps. The Waterlows dined last night—Dawks exactly like a squawking dab chick, waistless, in black, about to bear a child. She is a persistent, pertinacious woman, & keeps her end up by force of will. Beauty has not blessed her. Later she complained to me of her discontent—how she feels small, insignificant purposeless. I sketched a plan of her life, to which facts do not correspond. Sydney boomed out in the background that he too was unhappy “of course I’m unhappy—aren’t we all unhappy?—isn’t it inevitable, seeing that no one of us has any satisfactory scheme of things?” This quest for a scheme comes from living with Murry, who is in pursuit of one very laboriously, hunting it through the columns of the Athenaeum, for which reason Roger has broken with him—& that too we discussed, & how he turned Dawks out of the house. I laughed a good deal, & cheered myself at their discontent. Molly & Desmond seem more seriously in debt than I realised; & have somehow warded off their creditors by mortgaging old Mrs MacCarthy’s life. Poor Dawks, who has about £1600 a year complains of John’s behaviour, which entirely ruins her day. So they take the children to the Zoo on Sundays—An odd looking couple—the wrong assortment. Unromantic—terribly unromantic.

L. now translating Tchekov, & I must set to on my share, I suppose. Ralph comes twice a week or so, an indomitable, perhaps rather domineering, young man; loves dancing; in the pink of health; a healthy brain. He described a brothel the other night—how, after the event, he & the girl sat over the fire, discussing the coal strike. Girls paraded before him—that was what pleased him—the sense of power."
1920.11.23,"We see too many people for me to describe them, had I the time. I have lived the past 2 weeks methodically, printing till dark, allowing myself a day off, arranging things rather successfully; so my strip of pavement (I bag that phrase for Jacob) widens. O but Ive quarrelled with Nessa & Duncan! I’m standing on my dignity. They choose to tell me lies—very well, I don’t go near them till I’m asked. Will they notice? Not in all that shindy of children &c: but I’m cheerful & composed, & conscious of the immense value of my visits. Hope has been for the weekend—over-dressed, over elaborate, scented, extravagant, yet with thick nose, thick ankles; a little unrefined, I mean. That is I like her very much & think her very clever; but I don’t like women who are vain & lacking in self-confidence at the same time. It is easily explicable—the rich uncultivated father, brother a trim officer; wealth; health; Jane superimposed, & the greed, like a greed for almond paste, for fame. We talked very well together all the same; & I did my writing (a review of Lawrence sprung upon me) all the same. Why do I dislike unbalanced criticism so much—silliness about Edith Sitwell & Fredegond? As when Ottoline loads her mantelpiece with knick knacks. Old Gumbo in her brown overcoat, spontaneous & emphatic showed up very well beside her. But I’m exaggerating her defects. She is clever & subtle, & if she hasn’t much generosity, I’m not sure that clever people always have.

Then yesterday came Bob for tea, uneasy like a dog who has been roundly beaten for stealing from a butcher’s shop, at coming uninvited, & offering to go & leave us to work every 10 minutes. Then we got on to the Poetic Drama & he owned to having begun a new one three days ago. His arguments about the need of writing classical drama, not modern drama, evidently long in use; & I thoughtlessly asked him to write prose⁠[.] “I might as well ask you to write poetry!” he said. Indeed it was unkind. Still he showed up less angular & more considerate & mellow than usual, though L. detected pain in his eye—the legacy of Gladys Deacon perhaps. I like him for praising other writers so unthinkingly—without regard that is to his own position. He praised Eliot’s criticism, which had, he said, taken away his own confidence in the poetic drama. I doubt not that under the larches of Leith Hill that will flourish again. The most amusing of his refrains was about Norton. To hear Bob sigh & tread delicately like a hippopotamus holding its breath one would suppose Norton suicidal & maniac. The truth seems to be ‘but you must discount what I say—its very difficult to know what impression I’m giving—yet one must say something to his friends; & I think its going to be all right now; if we can get over the next few weeks—’ The truth is that he has given up mathematics ostensibly on Craig’s advice, feels humiliated, & daren’t face his friends, poor devil, Gordon Square that is. I think I can trace the crisis far back; his powers proving not quite what he thought; worry; strain; despondency; envisaging failure; thought of boasting; dread of being ridiculous—all that, & then his appearance against him with young women, morbid about sex, which clearly isn’t his strong line; culminating in a kind of breakdown on the motherly housemaid’s knee of good Bessy. There he sticks, afraid to issue out, without prospects, a man who has trusted entirely in intellect, & taken his cue from that, given to despising, rejecting, & tacitly claiming an exalted rank on the strength of mathematics which cant be done, & never could be done, I expect. (I quote Maynard) Such an egotist too; never able to see any other face save his own; & worrying out such laborious relationships always b⁠[etw]⁠een himself & other people. Now, poor creature, for I pity him & know his case from my own past, he translates stories from the French, & a book said to want doing by Ponsonby. I can imagine the kind of humility that must be on him, & how he gropes this winter, for some possible method in the future. And here’s L. & I can’t go on about the Memoir Club!"
1920.12.05,"The Memoir Club was fearfully brilliant—I mean I was; & Leonard so much more impressive with so much less pains; & Morgan very professional; & Mary never laughed once at my jokes. Well, I shall laugh loud at hers next Wednesday to make up. For here I am skipped to December, & only writing now I fear because my brain is tired of reading Coleridge. Why do I read Coleridge? Is it partly the result of Eliot whom I’ve not read; but L. has & reviewed & praised into the bargain. Eliot & Goldie dined here t’other night—a successful party. A cold in the head made me desperate like wine—nothing seemed to matter. I laughed in the grim marble face & got a twinkle back. What a big white face he has beside Goldie’s mobile brown monkey one! A mouth twisted & shut; not a single line free & easy; all caught, pressed, inhibited; but great driving power some where—& my word what concentration of the eye when he argues! We discussed criticism, & I find he thinks himself a poet. A little human laughter comes very welcome to him, as I guess, & I think he would willingly break up his formal ways. His details about his father in law’s appendicitis were very precise. My guess is that he wishes to detach himself from sets, & welcomes us as an escape. Then—what? Gerald Duckworth engaged to Miss Chad—does that count as news? dinner at the Toynbees, but I cant go into that. What do I want to go into? How hard we work—thats what impresses me this winter: every compartment stuffed tight, chiefly owing to the press. Whether we can keep it up, I don’t know. Then, both so popular, so well known, so much respected—& Leonard 40, & I nearing it, so there’s not much to boast of. In my heart, too, I prefer the nondescript anonymous days of youth. I like youthful minds; & the sense that no one’s yet anybody. This refers, with shocking slovenliness—but what will you? I cant write 2,000 words an hour carefully—to tea with Miss Hussey at Clifford’s Inn. I dont know why I saw my own youth there: she on her own, a journalist, poor, untidy, enthusiastic; & a younger brother coming in, to tea; not so clever, at least not launched; awkward; oh but so young! Both going off to the play, as Adrian & I did, years ago; but perhaps she’s happier than I was. Figure a poverty stricken room; gas fire broken; margarine; one table; books, mostly cheap ones; writing table; no ornament or easy chair—(perhaps I had it) dark november day; up several staircases; bath, kitchen behind a dingy curtain, & another woman sharing. We talked about the need of education. “Surely education must achieve something” the brother stammered. She would have none of it—clever, & paradoxical, & flighty—advanced; but I forgive all that for the sake of youth."
1920.12.12,"Nearing the end of the year. Everything muffled in snow & crisp with frost; streets knobbed & slippery; hands grimy as cold for some reason always makes them. Here we sit over the fire, expecting Roger—whose book is out; as everyone’s book is out—Katherine’s, Murry’s, Eliot’s. None have I read so far. I was happy to hear K. abused the other night. Now why? Partly some obscure feeling that she advertises herself; or Murry does it for her; & then how bad the Athenaeum stories are; yet in my heart I must think her good, since I’m glad to hear her abused.

Scenes now come to mind. Gordon Square at tea time—All those branches twisting themselves so fluently, like the Laocoon; so I saw them from Ralph’s upper room. Then there’s Lytton coming round to tea. At once we plunge, even on the cold pavement, into literature. Eliot’s book—“serious” far far better than the journalists—disgraceful review by Lynd. “Still he’s cut & dried—leaves cut—don’t like Milton.”—Shall Lytton write to the Nation? What about Vic? So we pace to Nessa’s door. And Ralph? Well, I wdn’t marry Ralph—A despot. True. But whats to happen to C. She can’t live indefinitely with me—Perhaps with him? Door opens, in I go; up I go; children there; sit over the stove; Nessa draws pictures for Angelica. And home again.

Molly Hamilton next. I’m enlarging my sphere, not very widely, but I take pains to accept what’s offered. When accepted, I feel that I must make the most. It’s not for nothing that I go out to tea. So there we sit, scratching on the match box. “I’m assistant editor to the Review of Reviews—at a salary of £570!” she cried. And so her mother can live in London; & she’s launched; poor Molly can do all this by chaining herself to the desk. There the desk was & books laid out as you see them in shops. Did the match burst into flame? Yes, I think so, about happiness, & human beings. I try not to think whether I’m liked for saying things, or what impression I make, only whether I think the things I say. But with another human being this is very difficult—so susceptible am I, so vain. The poetess came in—poor hard boiled egg, duck’s egg; going to dine at the Club, taking herself off.

I forget my first view of Molly, going down the Strand the night of the Cenotaph; such a lurid scene, like one in Hell. A soundless street; no traffic; but people marching. Clear, cold, & windless. A bright light in the Strand; women crying Remember the Glorious Dead, & holding out chrysanthemums. Always the sound of feet on the pavement. Faces bright & lurid—poor M.’s worn enough by that illumination. I touched her arm; whereupon she jumped, like some one woken. A ghastly procession of people in their sleep."
1920.12.19,"This I see will be the last page of the year, since I go to Janet tomorrow for the night; dine in London at a festival party on Tuesday night; & leave for Rodmell on Wednesday. I shan’t take this book with me, though if I’m in the mood I might scribble a page to bring back. I ought to say how happy I am, since one of these pages said how unhappy I was. I can’t see any reason in it. My only guess is that it has something to do with working steadily; writing things out of my head; & never having a compartment empty. That doesn’t mean that I dont stuff the corners with idle moments. I gaze at the fire. I make phrases—well, thats all well known. I can’t help suspecting that both Mr & Mrs Woolf slowly increase in fame. That helps to fill compartments. No doubt I like getting letters from publishers: even to be asked to preside over Mr Beresford slightly kindles me. Next year I shall be above all that. I’ve plucked out my jealousy of Katherine by writing her an insincere-sincere letter. Her books praised for a column in the Lit Sup—the prelude of paeans to come. I foresee editions; then the Hawthornden prize next summer. So I’ve had my little nettle growing in me, & plucked it as I say. I’ve revived my affection for her somehow, & don’t mind, in fact enjoy. But I’ve not read her book.

My book seems to me rather good. L.’s book seems to him (so I interpret) rather good. I am entreated to write for the T.L.S. True, I’m not asked to write for the Dial. Lytton is. Lytton dined here the other night; tired, wearied, by C. & P. I suspect, out every night at Gordon Square & pretending doubts about Vic. We discussed Norton’s case. L. very loyal to Apostles in distress, & refusing my irreverent analysis. We talk of going to Italy together. Then there was Roger, on a bitter cold night, but we stoked up, & I’ve been given his book [Vision and Design]—a sumptuous book—in return for writing 200 addresses. I think it reads rudimentary compared with Coleridge. Fancy reforming poetry by discovering something scientific about the composition of light!

Then, characteristically, he deposited a bed, bookcases & stained glass windows in our hall; the glass, of course, broken. I observe that I’m soon muzzled; & my depredations in the herd instantly punished. Indeed, Nessa wouldn’t have me living next door for something. Indeed, my retort is, I wouldn’t live there. I see myself now taking my own line apart from theirs. One of these days I shan’t know Clive if I meet him. I want to know all sorts of other people—retaining only Nessa & Duncan, I think.

The Olivers dined here; Ray sitting impassive in the arm chair, rotund, massive, a little surly, in the style of Widow Creighton. Oliver discussed music. She disapproves of abstract questions in a world where there are so many concrete ones. When she dines out she relaxes. A strange life—to believe in that division between reality & unreality. So we reach the end of the year; which is for us cheerful, I think. For one thing we want to get to Rodmell; to see what has happened to the garden. I shall like a soft grey walk. Then the post. Then reading. Then sitting in the chimney corner. I shall walk out on the flats. We take the servants & ensure comfort, for by contriving it, we’re now on the best of terms with them. Left to myself I should invite people down.—then probably regret it. But this is dawdling & rambling—never mind—this poor book must take what it can get & be thankful. (I use my new blotter, just given me by L. for the first time.)"
1920.12.21,"I add a postscript, observing that its the shortest day of the year, &, L. announces, the first of winter. But I want to note these things. I went to Farnham yesterday. Suburban society on the Bus going up. Young man back from city. Young woman been shopping. “Had a good day? Shall I take your parcels.” “No; you might run away with them.” Arch badinage. Oh terrible country! Like a giant hen run. Half built houses everywhere. Roads scratched. Heath sandy & mangy. Dinner with Cases. Red light on dog legs—leads me to say “How romantic other people’s lives are!” Suddenly the waits start. Scene flooded, of course: Janet not eating her maccaroni till they’d done. After dinner sitting over the fire, door half shut as usual. A mouse came out—“A nice gentleman’s mouse” I said. Consternation on part of Emphie. “But what are we to do? I’m thinking of that mouse. You can set a trap for rats but not for mice. Seems so craftly.” “Well then keep a cat”—“Yes thats nature’s way after all—” “Or leave it alone” “Oh dear no. Mice eat books; besides, they’re so dirty. Dear me Janet, I wish we hadn’t got a mouse.” Question why K.M. is indecent—“So silly, I think” says Emphie. “Might as well talk of washing one’s hands.” Biscuit & chocolate by my bed, on a small white mat, & so on. What else? oh yes: neighbours. Miss Leonard calling. “A name you don’t often hear. But theres a bootmaker in Oxford called Leonard. My brother had a pair of boots made there. His wife didn’t quite like it oh eh ha ho!” (little laughs like notes of a flute). ‘Mr Minchin writes reviews for the Spectator.’ said with great awe. Parrot’s hot stuff—Parrot’s a slack lot. Oh Parrot—Parrot’s put a sink in the front kitchen—Everyone abuses Parrot. Emphie has discovered honey at Bat’s Corner, unknown to oldest resident.

We should be dining with Nessa &c: but have been put off; & oh dear, I’m glad to sit over the fire—& how could I if I lived in London?"
1921.01.02,"(The first time I’ve written 1921. And it shouldn’t be written here—should be written on the first page of a new book—but we’re just back from Monk’s, & I cant settle to anything—must indeed take a bath & wash my head instantly.) I want to scribble notes of the Rodmell social. Talk with Mrs Hawkesford. Cheery looking woman with pimple on end of nose, dressed in dirty ermines. We gentry sat together; rustics tramping up & down the room (the schoolroom) bumping into me; solemn; spiritless—oh infinitely pathetic the ‘parties’ of the poor! Anyhow not so badly off as clergymen’s wives. The first thing she told me, with passion, was that Russell’s had sent a plain instead of a fruit cake. “Thats the way they treat you in the country. I can’t go 7 miles to complain. None of us like plain cakes. So it won’t be eaten. I had to make another cake today. And sometimes they send things so badly packed—in dirty paper too—that they fall to pieces when they’re undone—” Then, without preface, to the sorrows of family life. Olive in London, member of the forum, won’t stick to anything, now giving dancing lessons with Miss Barker “using Miss Barker’s name of course. Lady Portarlington is joining. Still, she won’t marry, girls dont who take to those ways—& whats to happen in middle life? Thats what I say.” Then Bowen. Almost 18 but wont put her hair up—“What am I to do? There’s no life for a girl here—no girl friends—She hears Olive talk of London. She’ll go next. If she leaves me I dont think I shall be able to stand it. I never sent her to a school so that she mightn’t get unsettled. We go to Brighton. She’s fond of lectures. She likes chemistry. Olive says she ought to read The Times. We dont take The Times—nor does Mr Allinson [Allison], He lends us picture papers. But she ought to read the debates. Then she could talk to people. Why I can hardly talk to educated people now. One gets out of things. One sees no one. Things happen without one’s knowing.” She had been in London, & stayed with friends in W. Kensington (where she was brought up) & their house looked over Queens [Club Athletic Ground]. “Always some game going on—ideal I call it”. She had made Bowen learn tennis at Tonbridge. “But we were only there for a fortnight—not long enough to learn. She’s so shy—People are so stand offish in Lewes. Nothing is ever got up. No tennis parties. Mr Babington (Lord Monk Bretton’s people you know) had a lawn at Rodmell Place. Mr Duberly turned his pony on it. Now its given up completely.” I offered books, tennis, & The Times. Real unhappiness of course—such isolation too; a cruelty to animals to keep a woman without interests alone in the country to magnify cakes. Still can’t go to London because in London a clergyman depends upon pew rents. I should have to pay calls. I should have to make myself nice to people. And we should only get a poor parish. Oh I dont say a word against this—or the people—only for 7 years we’ve not had a road—its too bad—

[Diary X]

HOGARTH HOUSE RICHMOND JAN. 1921"
1921.01.25,"Here have I waited 25 days before beginning the new year; & the 25 is, not unfortunately my 25th, but my 39th birthday; & we’ve had tea, & calculated the costs of printing Tchekov; now L. is folding the sheets of his book, & Ralph has gone, & I having taken this out of the press proceed to steal a few minutes to baptise it. I must help L. & can’t think of a solemn beginning. I’m at a crisis in Jacob: want to finish in 20,000 words, written straight off in a frenzy. And I must pull myself together to bring it off. Tomorrow we ini⁠[ti]⁠ate the Cock Club, Sanger, Pippa, Molly Hamilton & Sidney [Waterlow] dining ‘along side’ of us. Lytton has asked to dedicate Victoria to me, which pleases me, & I stipulate, from vanity, for my name in full.

Then, if I had time, I could write a new chapter in Clive’s life. Spring has miraculously renewed herself. Pink almond blossoms are in bud. Callow birds crow. In short, he’s out of love & in love, & contemplated eloping with a Spaniard in a motor car. “But after all, I said to myself as I walked back, I like to think of my book & my armchair. It’s terrible, terrible. I can’t give up my old friends after all.” The dusky one lives in Chelsea, has a car, no husband, children, & is beautiful as the Southern night. No one has ever seen her, & she, to her credit, has never heard of Maynard Keynes. We speculate about Mary’s attitude. Poor parrokeet fallen off her perch, or left to preen & prink in solitude. Then we’re just over the crest of a Sydney swell: such a solemn heaving one; the poor man’s bosom all clouded & turgid owing to Murry; who sits at Hampstead promulgating doctrines, & caring not at all that S. seriously thinks of leaving wife & children. “I have no solid core. I am unlike everyone else, & probably more unhappy.” Indeed his bloodhound eyes drooped & almost spilt tears. We talked sense into him, & the inflated tumour burst. He came down happier to breakfast; & a little less certain of the worth of Murry’s goodness. What Murry’s goodness amounts to I’m puzzled to say. K.M. (as the papers call her) swims from triumph to triumph in the reviews; save that Squire doubts her genius—so, I’m afraid, do I. These little points, though so cleanly collected, don’t amount to much, I think. I read her at the Club last night; then went with L. to the Grand Guignol."
1921.01.31,"Just back from Tidmarsh, from the Club, from Harrison’s [Dentist], from losing two books on a bus. Lytton keeps his books amazingly tidy, like books on the stage. We slept Friday night with Philip at the farm; wet of course; but dryness & comfort within. A hot bath, linen sheets (oh what a housekeeper I’m becoming!) Poor Philip—so I feel him—worn & dogged, but not much life in him. He is kept at it perpetually, now paying men, now tending a cow with ringworm. We walked to pay woodmen after breakfast through the slim green trees, fading away rather mysteriously, striping the view with their green. The woodmen had their fire in a ditch & were drinking tea. So round to the farm. The cows henpeck the bull, & don’t allow his attentions. Philip drove us over [to Tidmarsh], & we sat in the drawing room, lacking life as people’s empty rooms do. L. much depressed on Sunday morning & working out how many hours remained, before breakfast. Indeed, Saturday night was hard going. Lytton lapsed into gentle indifference, tired, depressed perhaps. Carrington I think grows older, & her doings are of the sort that age. L. told Murry’s story, & we rated him one of those born queer. Carrington had other versions of his machinations with other hypnotised rabbits. Still even this didn’t keep us going; & middle age—am I not 39?—brings I fear its dependence upon warmth & books & easy chairs. Next day was better, though of course one never has a [? box] in a strange house, & about 11.30 my eyes feel rough & sore with gazing at the fire. But it was better, undoubtedly. C⁠[arrington]. & R⁠[alph]. tactfully made out lists of summer flowers in the dining room.

“You ought to have dedicated Vic. to C.” I said.

Oh dear no—we’re not on those terms at all.

“Ottoline will be enraged.”

Yes, he thought she might be.

The ms. was there, & once I began reading it, I couldn’t stop; or rather had to stop myself. Talk of going to Italy at Easter with the party but—One of the ‘buts’ is the Press. I sometimes think that L. & I are settling in too soundly. And now, am I to learn Russian with him & Kot? If he can read it & solace his age with it I shall be furious. Talk about Keats & Wordsworth & C. & P⁠[artridge]. Lytton intends to live in Gordon Square permanently; & she is penniless; & P. is possessive—Perhaps after all, said Lytton, one oughtn’t to allow these attachments. Our parents may have been right. & so we discussed our parents, & how Ly S. & Lytton (Lord) & Fitzj. would sit talking till 2 a.m.—but what about? So many things could never be said, & the remaining ones coloured by the abstinence. But I’m broiling as I write & can’t settle to anything, & detest going away, & vow never to do it, but to work, work, work—"
1921.02.05,"Jealousy or ambition has won the day, & I’ve just had my first Russian lesson & mortgaged my time to the extent of doing three lessons weekly. L. is mumbling Russian as I write. Have I done a great deal of work in pursuance of my vow? Books begin to drop in, & so long as I can do them every other week I rather like the relief from Jacob. I am beginning the last lap; & it is a sprint towards the end, difficult to keep up.

We had the Memoir Club on Wednesday. Clive & Maynard read; both elaborate & polished, Clive mellow & reminiscent about Mrs Raven Hill (he had her 2 years after his marriage, & for the last time in 1914. She is now imbecile. This was a surprise to me. She coincided with his attachment to me then. But she was a voluptuary. He was not ‘in love’.) Maynard, of course, was the solid piece of the evening, so long indeed that we had to leave before the end. I was a little bored by the politics, & a good deal impressed by the method of character drawing. Rosy Wemyss, illegitimate descendant of William the 4th came out very well,—sitting in mock despair at the conference where he presided, unable to answer a question until Maynard had scribbled it for him. Then Melchior; & his room, where the three clerks refused to leave off playing the piano. “Smoking isn’t allowed until 5” they said; “This is the German revolution” was Melchior’s comment. “I was rather in love with him” said Maynard. I think he meant it seriously, though we laughed. Then L.G. at the table, overwhelmed by his own eloquence—denouncing Klotz & ‘goold’ making a gesture as of a miser sweeping up money bags. All this was very brilliantly told. Mary was there; & I note that one likes her better, partly for showing fight; partly, perhaps, for not being the mistress any longer. I am in hot water for having told Sydney, which I did deliberately, without malice, as conversation, thinking it allowed. Oh what a goose Sydney is! What does he do but march up & congratulate Clive in front of everyone!"
1921.02.16,"Russian is snatching all the time spared for this book. I can only keep up with L. by running as hard as I can. Everyone prophecies an early end. But I feel myself attached to an express train. With Kot & Leonard dragging me, I must be pulled through somehow. Six months continued at this rate—Russian from 12.15 to 12.45 & from 5.30 to 6. from 9.30 to 10, & on the way to Waterloo & back again must have some result. So far the chief one is as I say that I don’t write here. Let me think how many occasions I have let slip.

We have dined twice at the Cock, repairing afterwards to Hussey’s—no Hussey has married the dullest man in England—to Niemeyer’s room; the gas fire is broken. We balance on hard chairs. But the atmosphere is easy & pleasant; the dinner modest, solid, & somehow in keeping with our clothes. More & more do I become in a state of undress. I believe this affects my writing—or its the other way about. Pale, marmoreal Eliot was there last week, like a chapped office boy on a high stool, with a cold in his head, until he warms a little, which he did. We walked back along the Strand. “The critics say I am learned & cold” he said. “The truth is I am neither.” As he said this, I think coldness at least must be a sore point with him.

Then there was Murry’s farewell dinner at 46. Clive gritty & bawling, Lytton observant & mute. The rest much as usual. I sat next Murry, & let my prejudices run away with me for the first half. He posed, I thought; looked anguished & martyred. Yet the dinner was at his request. I kept thinking how he summed up us & held us worthless. Then, at the end, I asked after Katherine. Poor man! he poured himself out. We sat on after the others had gone.

“But I lacked imagination, he said. I never saw. I ought to have understood. I’ve always held one was free to do as one likes. But she was ill, & that made all the difference. And it was nothing—nothing at all.”

This referred of course, without names, to the Bibesco Scandal, with which London, so they say, rings.

“And I adore Katherine—She’s absolutely the most fascinating person in the world—I’m wholly in love with her.”

Apparently she is worse—dying? God knows. This affair seems to have brought on a crisis. She is desperately depressed, thinks her book bad, can’t write; accuses herself; I imagine, is beside herself with jealousy. Murry asked me to write to her. She feels herself out of things, left alone, forgotten. As he spoke with great feeling, & seemed to be very miserable, & anxious to apologise (was it for this that he wished to see us all—to prove that there was nothing in it?) I liked him, felt with him, & I think there can be no doubt that his love for Katherine anyhow is sincere. All the rest seems of no great importance beside it. Sydney’s version is of course absurdly over emphatic. We went upstairs & told stories about Ottoline. Desmond was the chief performer. He gets his edges too blurred for my taste. Humanity can be due to laziness, as well as kindness. He refuses to think—seems to trust to natural niceness to float him through personal affairs—or so I feel; & thus gets nothing very sharp or thrilling. At anyrate, when Lytton & Roger came to facts they painted a far more splendid vivid figure, Owing to Leonard, it may be, or to natural good taste, I find 46 a little blaring & brazen always, & didn’t much mind catching the last train home. Lytton slipped out with us & whispered his horror & repulsion in the hall. Never would he dine there again. Clive too appalling. L. agreed. So did I. For the truth is no one can speak in their natural voice. Clive was telephoning to Gavrillana (or how does she call herself)? for twenty minutes. An envelope addressed to her lay in the hall. He plumes himself on the affair, which might be conducted on the moon for all I believe in it. I imagine her as stupid as a pearl tie pin.

I skip lots of people, lots of doings. We now think of Cornwall at Easter, with Lytton’s troupe. My book is an eyesore, & I wake in the night twitching with horror at the thought of it. Now to Dorothy Wordsworth—a quiet evening for once. We have taken to dining out, for some reason."
1921.02.18,"I have been long meaning to write a historical disquisition on the return of peace; for old Virginia will be ashamed to think what a chatterbox she was, always talking about people, never about politics. Moreover, she will say, the times you lived through were so extraordinary. They must have appeared so, even to quiet women living in the suburbs. But indeed nothing happens at one moment rather than another. The history books will make it much more definite than it is. The most significant sign of peace this year is the sales; just over; the shops have been flooded with cheap clothes. A coat & skirt that cost £14 in November went for 7 perhaps 5. People had ceased to buy, & the shops had to dispose of things somehow. Margery Strachey who has been teaching at Debenhams foretells bankruptcy for most of the shopkeepers this very month. Still they go on selling cheaply. Pre-war prices, so they say. And I have found a street market in Soho where I buy stockings at 1/ a pair: silk ones (flawed slightly) at 1/10. A hundred yards down the road they ask 5/6 to 10/6 for the same things, or so they seem. Food has fallen a penny here, a penny there, but our books scarcely show a change. Milk is high, 11d a quart. Butter fallen to 3/- but this is Danish butter. Eggs—I dont know what eggs are. Servant girls aged 20 get £45 wages. And the Times pays me 3 guineas instead of £2.2 for a column. But I think you’ll find all this written more accurately in other books, my dear Virginia: for instance in Mrs Gosse’s diary & Mrs Webb’s. I think it true to say that during the past 2 months we have perceptibly moved towards cheapness—just perceptibly. It is just perceptible too that there are very few wounded soldiers abroad in blue, though stiff legs, single legs, sticks shod with rubber, & empty sleeves are common enough. Also at Waterloo I sometimes see dreadful looking spiders propelling themselves along the platform—men all body—legs trimmed off close to the body. There are few soldiers about.

To change the subject, Rose Macaulay dined here last week—something like a lean sheep dog in appearance—harum scarum—humble—too much of a professional, yet just on the intellectual side of the border. Might be religious though: mystical perhaps. Not at all dominating or impressive: I daresay she observes more than one thinks for. Clear pale mystical eyes. A kind of faded moon of beauty: oh & badly dressed. I don’t suppose we shall ever meet for she lives with Royd Smith, & somehow won’t come to grips with us."
1921.02.21,"To fill in an awkward space between Russian & dinner I take up this book. I ought to notice the long drawn spring afternoon—tea easily by daylight—Ralph able to set up 8 lines afterwards. Leonard’s book will be printed by the end of the week perhaps. Massingham would be grateful if I would review D. Richardson for him. This amuses & slightly gratifies me—especially as I refuse. We dined with Roger the other night; & found Sydney still a grudging reluctant convert—still remembering his master, not his own man or Roger’s man. After dinner we turned over sketches in the studio—not the pleasantest occupation for a cold night. Still old Roger has a quality of imagination which attracts me—loose & warm & genuine, in contrast to the costive judicial Sydney, who was catching us out all the time. Sydney looks melancholy; is touched with grey. This gives him an air of distinction. I daresay his face has been one of his horrors. The looking glass always confirming the Apostles. Then we had Quentin & Julian for Sunday, packed Julian home with a temperature, & I put him to bed. Quentin ran in to see Angelica; came up saying she was better but very white. I liked to think of all this set going in the younger generation.

Saxon & Matthew for dinner—a successful combination. A tyrannous old mother has again devastated a daughters life. I see how easily one says of course the daughter must look after her—of course she does, & gives up her dream—only of Geneva—still it was a dream; & must now teach music in Maida Vale until the old tyrant dies."
1921.03.01,"I am not satisfied that this book is in a healthy way. Suppose one of my myriad changes of style is antipathetic to the material?—or does my style remain fixed? To my mind it changes always. But no one notices. Nor can I give it a name myself. The truth is that I have an internal, automatic scale of values; which decides what I had better do with my time. It dictates ‘This half hour must be spent on Russian’ ‘This must be given to Wordsworth.’ or ‘now I’d better darn my brown stockings.’ How I come by this code of values I dont know. Perhaps its the legacy of puritan grandfathers. I suspect pleasure slightly. God knows. And the truth is also that writing, even here, needs screwing of the brain—not so much as Russian, but then half the time I learn Russian I look in the fire & think what I shall write tomorrow. Mrs Flanders is in the orchard. If I were at Rodmell I should have thought it all out walking on the flats. I should be in fine writing trim. As it is Ralph Carrington & Brett have this moment gone; I’m dissipated; we dine & go out to the Guild. I cant settle as I should to think of Mrs Flanders in the orchard. Brett is gay, pink, brown, vivacious. Why did I think her a moping figure in the chimney corner? Ott’s insinuations, I suppose. She told me that she has an inner view of Ottoline unguessed by the rest of us. Deafness, she says, makes one a judge of truth. You become an expert in faces.

We came back from Rodmell yesterday; & Rodmell was all gold & sunshine. The one dismal element was provided by the human race. We went to tea at the Rectory, & found, alas, a roomful of dressed women, including Mrs Allinson, & Mr Fisher, & Mr & Mrs Shanks. This surly poet, so we judged him (and his poetry is Squire’s poetry) proposes to live in the village. We shall meet him. He will look in. Oh dear—no more dreaming & rambling for me—always the risk of a recall to editions & royalties, & what Sylvia Lynd thinks of Tomlinson. Our garden becomes a suburban garden. Anything would be better than a poet—than one of Squire’s poets. I would rather have Gerald Duckworth himself—& he is to be married tomorrow.

It is settled that we go to Zennor with the Lytton company on the 23rd. Before that we go to Manchester. So the summer is on us. Already I feel time broken up. I must buy some clothes. & I note with pride that I have just received £45 from America for the V⁠[oyage]. O⁠[ut]. Then Violet Dickinson came to tea here—grown half a foot taller, but otherwise unchanged; wrists a little coarse & even dirty; pearls & emeralds round her neck; asking questions, never listening, rapid, intuitive, humorous in her slap dash way, careering about to tea parties marriages & sick beds & keeping up her connection with lunatics & institutions, like a woman of the 90ties. One of the lay sisters who go about doing good, & talking gossip, almost improved out of existence nowadays I suppose; a survival from the 19th Century are of individual goodness.

My book is back from the printer, who has added the final eyesore—a brown back. There it is in masses, & I can’t read it, for fear of howlers, printers as well as writers. L.’s stories are today, bating a line or two, done. Now Clive proposes we should bring out his private poems. Morgan goes to India, & I think for ever. He will become a mystic, sit by the roadside, & forget Europe, which I think he half despises. In thirty years time he may turn up again, give us an amused look, & return to the East, having written a little unintelligible poetry. He has no roots here. And the news made me melancholy. I like him, & like having him about. But we shan’t see him again. He sails on Friday."
1921.03.06,"But perhaps I colour my view of Morgan from my painter’s box. At any rate, Bob at the Cock the other night made it all seem very reasonable & desirable—“a trip to India just the thing for him—a relief after his … well, his mother is trying sometimes—very fond of him, of course; devoted to him & he…” This in the usual Bob style, hinting little defects & mysteries with one corner of his mouth, praising with the other.

We had a Cock on Friday—perhaps not quite so good, though vociferous & noisy. Marjorie dines out seldom, I fancy, likes society, throws herself into it, & dresses in salmon pink, short skirt & white stockings: like all Stracheys undoes her premedi⁠[t]⁠ated care by unpremeditated outbursts—hugs her legs till you see—well, all there is. Then I was locked with Bob; had my brain wrung dry by his horny conscientious hands. He starts so well; means so well; is a man of such seriousness & integrity—touched with white on the temples to lend him dignity too—so that to begin with I both like & admire. Oh yes: I end with that too; & yet the steam roller has gone over me—he takes criticism say, or the verse drama, & by the time its over, everything is tight tied in knots; nothing illuminated. He has a shrewd way with him; but why he ever applied himself to an art which wants invention, richness, abandon, originality I really cant say. Poor Bobo was a little stupid as she expressed it: dumb, I should have said; brooding ineffectively over the sorrows of the world. Poor Betty … poor someone else, left with a bastard. Then she can’t, as she says ‘find my form’, whether its to be realism, romance, comedy, tragedy. I was more interested in poor Betty, who has come a cropper, which as I explained, is what one likes people to do. She lost £200 on her play the other day (Wilde, Bottomley & Fielding: unrecorded) got no notices, no praise, can get no work, has spent all her money; is financed by the Mayors, but they cant make a great actress of her, provide her with a chin, or curtail her nose. She flames with the most melodramatic ambition. Nothing short of a great part, a great audience, a great success will satisfy her. She refuses to accept whatever it is she might have, leaves dreadful notes on the hall table for Bobo—who in her turn writes plays, can’t find her form, & is rejected by stage managers. One sees indeed, without much difficulty why the type is an unmarketable one. All is too soft & emotional. Now for writing or anything I believe you must be able to screw up into a ball & pelt straight in people’s faces. They vagulate & dissipate.

We parted on an island in Kingsway: she saying to me, looking out from her great dark eyes under her wide hat, hair looping down, a little wild, yet infinitely soft—even woolly, “I see this evening that I must give up writing” or words to that effect. What she meant, I dont know. Was it a compliment to me? as I should like to think. How pleasant to have ruined someone’s life all in one evening! But she is one of those who only drift a little way in desperation: she is anchored in niceness & general muddle. So I daresay, is Betty, to whom I’ve just written.

Nessa approves of Monday or Tuesday—mercifully; & thus somewhat redeems it in my eyes. But I now wonder a little what the reviewers will make of it—this time next month. Let me try to prophecy. Well, the Times will be kindly, a little cautious. Mrs Woolf, they will say, must beware of virtuosity. She must beware of obscurity … her great natural gifts &c…. She is at her best in the simple lyric, as in Kew Gardens. An Unwritten Novel is hardly a success. And as for A Society, though spirited, it is too one-sided. Still Mrs Woolf can always be read with pleasure. Then, in the Westminster, Pall Mall, other serious evening papers I shall be treated very shortly, with sarcasm. The general line will be that I am becoming too much in love with the sound of my own voice: not much in what I write: indecently [?] affected; a disagreeable woman. The truth is, I expect, that I shan’t get very much attention anywhere. Yet, I become rather well known. Now L. may have considerable success."
1921.03.10,"Mr Chancellor has been here trying to make us discontented with our offer for Suffield—not that it is an offer: we have stated terms; will take £1400. Now Chancellors say at auction we might get £17 or £1800. But this is doubtful; & an amusing example of the tug of war between business men, & the shady shifts they resort to to poach each others game.

For news, what is there? I lunched with Nessa & Duncan the other day, & dashed my pleasure by losing my Roman brooch. Duncan has a large proper studio with a gallery, a deserted place, very silent, off Haverstock Hill, where a murder might take place, or a dead body be found. On the contrary, they were very cheerful, having been to Cambridge, seen the Greek play, heard Roger lecture, & ravished their eyes on several beauties—for there are beauties now, not seekers after truth, as in my day.

Norton has descended. Bob, of course, muddled it all up. Norton can lunch at any rate at 46; & proposes to live there; yet is desperate; verging on suicidal; can talk of nothing but himself; & will, Nessa thinks, hang about them all like an old decomposing albatross. There’s a new suggestion Dr who can make your hair curl, & unravel every knot in your nerves as far as 20 years back—but Norton can’t be made to face him. So Craig goes on rubbing in the suggestion that Norton can’t work; & he can’t work; & now proposes to get employment with the Webbs. What other news? Singularly little in the way of letters this week, not that I ever write them."
1921.03.13,"Well our terms for Suffield have been accepted of course; & of course we feel, or I feel, slightly defrauded—great nonsense, as we are sure of our money this way, save on the auction, & at most could only have made another £150, I suppose. Still it was the gambler’s chance that I liked. People called Turner have bought it, old & deaf, which appears to be necessary should you live at Suffield.

We dined with the Sangers εahyεpob on Friday. No one there, or came in afterwards, but Molly [MacCarthy]; & all our grey heads over the fire made me feel a little greyheaded. We discussed death, a sore subject with Dora, I suspect; one of her morbidities. She cant face it. But then death, as I made out for myself at the age of 12, coming at the end of illness is altogether different from death as one sits over the fire. Charlie a little silent as this went forward, as at the display of a wifes complexes husbands mostly are. Molly was very deaf, resigned, but intermittently deaf only. Charlie not very encouraging about Russian—at least he says the literature is scarcely worth the trouble. Nothing but the great novels, & these adequately translated. But I doubt whether any English pupil can judge of this. A person with my taste shut up in a library might unearth treasures. Anyhow this is provision for old age. Also we talk of Russia next year—also language helps one to understand writers atmosphere, like seeing their country. And then Kot will pull us through; & vanity urges. Kot, poor honest somehow wounded man let out by chance that Katherine lost 3 ms books he [word missing] of Tchehov’s letters. He patiently sets to work to write them out again. Unless she has some very good excuse this seems to me wanton cruelty on her part. She is a tidy methodical woman. How could one lose 3 books lent one by a man who gets his bread by writing? But she never abused Kot; as he does them.

Time is a good deal broken just now by the journey to Manchester next Wednesday. We come back on Friday, then to Cornwall on Wednesday. So what am I to write? What am I to read? I have scribbled an article for Desmond; tomorrow I distemper the kitchen rose pink & leaf green. I can’t begin Dorothy Wordsworth, nor start Jacob’s travels to the East. Still, I generally put in my pen & pick out something.

In the way of history the Germans have gone back to Germany. People go on being shot & hanged in Ireland. Dora described mass going on all day in Dublin for some wretched boy killed early on Monday morning. The worst of it is the screen between our eyes & these [?] gallows is so thick. So easily one forgets it—or I do. For instance why not set down that the Maids of Honour shop was burnt out the other night? Is it a proof of civilisation to envisage suffering at a distance—& then the faculty of seeing that laws matter—the constitution of Cheko-Slovakia for example—is that an important one? Anyhow very little bestowed on me.

Eliot dines here tonight, alone, since his wife is in a nursing home, not much to our regret. But what about Eliot? Will he become ‘Tom’? What happens with friendships undertaken at the age of 40? Do they flourish & live long? I suppose a good mind endures, & one is drawn to it & sticks to it, owing to having a good mind myself. Not that Tom admires my writing, damn him.

Nessa has influenza; slightly; & I’m glad to see how solicitous dear old Duncan is, waiting on her, & taking thought for her, better I think than Clive ever did. That little man postpones his poems till the autumn, meaning, I daresay, to add one or two in praise of his dusky lady. I am told that poor Moll Hutch, found the separation intolerable, & has come back to platonic intercourse; strictly platonic. How the pismire survives the tug of war; or whether he sucks pleasure from it I cannot say. Anyhow he dines out nightly, ‘not been in, I suppose, since the night you dined with us,’ he boasts; & mixes with society ‘which, thank God, he doesn’t bring here’ says Nessa. I trace some anxiety on her part for his welfare. Perhaps one doesn’t like the father of one’s children to dissolve into pure lust & gluttony & pleasure & vainglory. She hopes, anyhow, that he will return to Charleston this summer & write his book on Civilisation. His views on that subject will be on lines agreeable with her present life, I suppose. Will the lady have taught him a fresh version of the old story? I fancy when he began the book, 15 years ago, he was a Moorite. Well, I suppose there are Moors in Spain. Now the light fades (though I am just becoming brilliant) & I must tackle the aspects [of Russian verbs] & the Labour party programme—one of L.’s triumphs."
1921.03.18,"Just back from two days at Manchester. I fancied myself writing this account, & how good it would be; what lots of things I had to say; & now the pen brings blankness. Well I was kept awake by business men talking in low steady almost continuous voices in the room above till 1.30: & we were up early, breakfasted & caught a train, & so home, travelling all through the great rocky moors of Derbyshire—bald moors; the strangest looking places. So solitary they might be 18th Century England, the valleys cut by a thread of water falling roughly from heights; great sweeps of country all sunny & gloomy with bare rocks against the sky, & then behold a row of east end slum houses, with a strip of pavement & two factory chimneys set down in the midst. The houses are all stone, bleak, soot stained, different from our cottages; not cottages at all, but streets. Suddenly, in the palm of a wide valley you come on a complete town—gasworks, factories, & little streams made to run over stone steps & turn engines I suppose. Now & again no houses but wild moors, a thread of road, & farms set into the earth, uncompromising, since nothing like flowers, long grass, or hedges grow round them.

“Yes, I said to Mrs Unwin, Derbyshire is a very fine country.” We were standing in a pit at the University, a table beneath a light below us, & a row of chairs, on which sat Professors Unwin, Findlay, Goldman (a financier) & Weiss. Leonard then got up & made his speech, a very vigorous one. We sat round on hard benches, with ink pots, or the holes for them, in front of us.

All Manchester streets are the same, & all strung with tramlines. These follow each other at a few yards distance, making the roads mechanical & unsociable. You hear bells striking all the time. Then there are no tea shops, but great cafés; & no little shops, but all big drapers. We lodged (paying 18/ each for bed only) at the Queens Hotel, in a large square; but whats a square when the trams meet there? Then there’s Queen Victoria, like a large tea cosy, & Wellington, sleek as a mastiff with paw extended; none of this was quite English, or at least London. The people were lower middle class, no sprinkling of upper class.

But my observation of the university type was more profound. Mr & Mrs Weiss gave a dinner in the refectory before L.’s second speech; & there they all were—professors & wives, elderly people, depressed looking, like the inferior branch of a profession, with the manner of dons, but not the extreme confident eccentricity of first rate brains. But how supercilious I thought myself, & ultimately how much pure merit seemed in them, with the very thinnest coating of decorum. The women were dowdy; oh yes, but they too had fought for the right—which is a phrase I distrust, but how use any other of people, struggling along just decently on so many pounds a year, & sacrificing it, as a matter of course, for their views. P. Unwin told me he had been arrested 3 times for attending seditious meetings during the war. Mrs Weiss said her husband had resigned because the University refused to accept a C.O. upon which they thought better of it. And yet there is no surface brilliancy; not a scrap of romance. It is a little familiar professional society, trying to keep up the standards, which (perhaps wrongly) I suppose must be hard work in Manchester, or am I merely snobbish in thinking it harder to say clever things & write clever books in Manchester than in Cambridge? I applied the test of father’s name twice; but neither Unwin or Weiss had heard it. The women had their activities not so pronounced as in Cambridge, pleasanter perhaps; common efforts to get up bazaars; enquiries about health; shabby best clothes. Old Mrs (Findlay) Herford (I distributed the husbands & wives all wrongly) & Professor Finlay sat patiently looking at the tablecloth with nothing to say, like two old horses who have been working in the fields all day together.

L., in the large room after dinner, was emphatically first rate; I don’t mean his clothes; nor yet his speech; but its a question of being the master. Now all the professors know that they’re not masters. I think L.’s remark that he did not wish to be elected rather flabbergasted them; & I fancy they asked themselves afterwards why the Woolves had taken the trouble to come—“Are you a politician?” they asked me. “Do you do much organising work?” I said I listened. Mrs Findlay shook her head. Why was I there then? Oh for the fun of spending £10 in Manchester & seeing the Zoo. Lord! what a scatterbrain I am! But they’d none of them read my books. So we went to the Zoo; & I daresay I could write something interesting about that—a pale stone desert given over to charwomen & decorators: a few bears, a mandrill, & a fox or two—all in the desolation of depression."
1921.03.22,"Here we are on the verge of going to Cornwall. This time tomorrow—it is now 5.20—we shall be stepping onto the platform at Penzance, sniffing the air, looking for our trap, & then—Good God!—driving off across the moors to Zennor—Why am I so incredibly & incurably romantic about Cornwall? One’s past, I suppose: I see children running in the garden. A spring day. Life so new. People so enchanting. The sound of the sea at night. And now I go back “bringing my sheaves”—well, Leonard, & almost 40 years of life, all built on that, permeated by that: how much so I could never explain. And in reality it is very beautiful. I shall go down to Treveal & look at the sea—old waves that have been breaking precisely so these thousand years. But I see I shall never get this said, & Lottie is chattering.

We had Eliot to dinner on Sunday & went to Love for Love, he & I in the Pit; L. upstairs, with a ticket from the New Statesman. Eliot & I had to drive in to Hammersmith in a taxi, having missed our train. We passed through dark market gardens. ‘Missing trains is awful’ I said. “Yes. But humiliation is the worst thing in life” he replied. “Are you as full of vices as I am?” I demanded. “Full. Riddled with them.” “We’re not as good as Keats” I said. “Yes we are” he replied. “No: we dont write classics straight off as magnanimous people do.” “We’re trying something harder” he said. “Anyhow our work is streaked with badness” I said. “Compared with theirs, mine is futile. Negligible. One goes on because of an illusion.” He told me that I talked like that without meaning it. Yet I do mean it. I think one could probably become very intimate with Eliot because of our damned self conscious susceptibility: but I plunge more than he does: perhaps I could learn him to be a frog. He has the advantage of me in laughing out. He laughed at Love for Love: but thinking I must write about it I was a little on the stretch. We saw George Moore talking to Eddie Marsh, on some steps; a little obese, dim eyed, weak, inconsiderable. I was disappointed. There was no rakish poll to be seen. As for Clive he dresses as effectively as any beauty, & poses like someone at a first night. Mary was there. “Tom”, she said, “you must come and see the boat race.” Well, these women’s emotions, which I don’t trouble to write out, are amusing; not very serious in my case. Then we met Nessa & Duncan, as shabby as old moths, making off home together. I bought a pair of boots yesterday for 33/6, which were made for another & fit me precisely. The truth is my foot is shaped like a snake. I have muddled away these 3 days, as far as writing is concerned, & intend to write nothing in Cornwall; but to read the classics. Candide: Shakespeare—historical plays: Adolphe: Keats’ Letters: Thomas Hardy: & perhaps Hudibras. I shall find some old biography or 10th rate novel & read only that. Never mind.

Leonard is an impulsive man. He has lent Monks House to Mrs Martin. She goes there tomorrow. As she is a complete zany, has no husband, no control over anything, & floats down stream, I see no reason why she should ever get out of Monk’s House. How are we to turn her out? And somehow I see her laying eggs diffusively all over the garden—an amorphous jelly of a woman, German too.

I had tea with Nessa yesterday & heard a pack of troubles. Poor Ann has inherited Karin’s disease of the ear & must be operated on. They have notice to leave Charleston. And Clive, as she remarks, is not much help at Easter. Adrian came in to tell me that Desmond wanted me, to demand my article instantly. Adrian wears a short red-brown moustache, reminding me in a ghastly way of the hair that grows after death. So distinguished I always think him, but (to me) so repressive.

As for other news, I think I have never said that Lytton stays at home with Lady Strachey, who has taken to fainting on the floor."
1921.03.30,"This is the last evening, & L. is packing, & I’m not in the mood for writing, but feel superstitiously that I should like to read something actually written in Cornwall. By looking over my left shoulder I see gorse yellow against the Atlantic blue, running up, a little ruffled, to the sky, today hazy blue. And we’ve been lying on the Gurnard’s Head, on beds of samphire among grey rocks with buttons of yellow lichen on them. How can I pick out the scene? You look down onto the semitransparent water—the waves all scrambled into white round the rocks—gulls swaying on bits of seaweed—rocks now dry now drenched with white waterfalls pouring down crevices. No one near us, but a coastguard sitting outside the house.

We took a rabbit path round the cliff, & I find myself a little shakier than I used to be. Still however maintaining without force to my conscience that this is the loveliest place in the world. It is so lonely. Occasionally a very small field is being ploughed, the men steering the plough round the grey granite rocks. But the hills & the cliffs have been given over as a bad job. There they lie graceful even in spite of all their stones & roughness, long limbed, stretching out to sea; & so subtly tinted; greys, all various with gleams in them; getting transparent at dusk; & soft grass greens; & then one night they burnt the heather at Tregerthen, the smoke rolling up over the crest, & flame shining. This we saw from Ka’s. The Eagle’s Nest stands up too much of a castle-boardinghouse to be a pleasant object; but considering the winds, firm roots are needed. Endless varieties of nice elderly men to be seen there, come for climbing."
1921.04.08,"10 minutes to eleven a.m. And I ought to be writing Jacob’s Room;—I can’t, & instead I shall write down the reason why I can’t—this diary being a kindly blank faced old confidante. Well, you see, I’m a failure as a writer. I’m out of fashion; old; shan’t do any better; have no head piece; the spring is everywhere; my book [Monday or Tuesday] out (prematurely) & nipped, a damp firework. Now the solid grain of fact is that Ralph sent my book out to the Times for review without date of publication in it. Thus a short notice is scrambled through to be in “on Monday at latest”, put in an obscure place, rather scrappy, complimentary enough, but quite unintelligent. I mean by that they don’t see that I’m after something interesting. So that makes me suspect that I’m not. And thus I can’t get on with Jacob. Oh & Lytton’s book is out & takes up three columns: praise, I suppose. I do not trouble to sketch this in order; or how my temper sank & sank till for half an hour I was as depressed as I ever am. I mean I thought of never writing any more—save reviews. To rub this in we had a festival party at 41 [Gordon Square]: to congratulate Lytton; which was all as it should be; but then he never mentioned my book, which I suppose he has read; & for the first time I have not his praise to count on. Now if I’d been saluted by the Lit. Sup. as a mystery & a riddle, I shouldn’t mind; for Lytton wouldn’t like that sort of thing, but if I’m as plain as day, & negligible?

Well, this question of praise & fame must be faced. (I forgot to say that Doran has refused the book in America). How much difference does popularity make? (I see pretty clearly, I may add, after a pause in which Lottie has brought in the milk & the sun has ceased to eclipse itself, that I’m writing a good deal of nonsense.) One wants, as Roger said very truly yesterday, to be kept up to the mark; that people should be interested, & watch one’s work. What depresses me is the thought that I have ceased to interest people—at the very moment when, by the help of the press, I thought I was becoming more myself. One does not want an established reputation, such as I think I was getting, as one of our leading female novelists. I have still, of course, to gather in all the private criticism, which is the real test. When I have weighed this I shall be able to say whether I am ‘interesting’ or obsolete. Anyhow, I feel quite alert enough to stop, if I’m obsolete. I shan’t become a machine, unless a machine for grinding articles. As I write, there rises somewhere in my head that queer, & very pleasant sense, of something which I want to write; my own point of view. I wonder, though, whether the feeling that I write for half a dozen instead of 1500 will pervert this?—make me eccentric,—no, I think not. But, as I said, one must face the despicable vanity which is at the root of all this niggling & haggling. I think the only prescription for me is to have a thousand interests—if one is damaged, to be able instantly to let my energy flow into Russian, or Greek, or the press, or the garden, or people, or some activity disconnected with my own writing.

But, honestly, I need not pull a very long face yet. Roger is staying with us. I think he has the nicest nature among us—so open, sincere, & entirely without meanness; always generous, I think, & somehow hearty? He throws out a tremendous laugh. We went to the Bedford Music Hall last night, & saw Miss Marie Lloyd, a mass of corruption—long front teeth—a crapulous way of saying ‘desire’, & yet a born artist—scarcely able to walk, waddling, aged, unblushing. A roar of laughter went up when she talked of her marriage. She is beaten nightly by her husband. I felt that the audience was much closer to drink & beating & prison than any of us. The coal strike is on. If I weren’t crowded & hurried & distracted I would bring my Gordon Square gossip up to date. Juana Ganderilla has been seen—a lady in the continental style, lovely, composed, simple, illiterate, emotional, going into trances."
1921.04.10,"I must note the symptoms of the disease, so as to know it next time. The first day one’s miserable: the second happy. There was an Affable Hawk on me in the New Statesman which at anyrate made me feel important (& its that that one wants) & Simpkin & Marshall rang up for a second fifty copies. So they must be selling. Now I have to stand all the twitching & teasing of private criticism which I shant enjoy. There’ll be Roger tomorrow. What a bore it all is!—& then one begins to wish one had put in other stories—or left out the Haunted House, which may be sentimental. Anyhow next week there’ll be Tchekhov & Leonard as well as me. And suppose every one (that is to say the 6 people who matter) praise Leonard, shall I be jealous—but, mark my word, all of this will be forgotten in 6 weeks time.

Pernel dined here: they dress badly, as I think I’ve said before. I think perhaps she grows a little pensive; but I’m not good at judging my friends’ moods. Then Roger came in—utterly unwearied—in spite of standing on a ladder for 8 hours restoring Mantegnas. He draws people here in shoals—yesterday, just after Kot had gone, in came Mr & Mrs Reece, & tomorrow there’ll be Pippa—always some slave or other attending; & as we’re in the middle of the rush we get whelmed, & I can’t write sense or nonsense, & must devote all this week to reviewing.—I want to read Victoria & Swift."
1921.04.12,"I must hurriedly note more symptoms of the disease, so that I can turn back here & medicine myself next time. Well; I’d worn through the acute stage, & come to the philosophic semi depressed, indifferent, & spent the afternoon taking parcels round the shops, going to Scotland Yard for my purse, when L. met me at tea & dropped into my ear the astonishing news that Lytton thinks the String Quartet ‘marvellous’. This came through Ralph, who doesn’t exaggerate, to whom Lytton need not lie; & did for a moment flood every nerve with pleasure, so much so that I forgot to buy my coffee & walked over Hungerford Bridge twanging & vibrating. A lovely blue evening too, the river sky colour. And then there was Roger who thinks I’m on the track of real discoveries, & certainly not a fake. And we’ve broken the record of sales, so far. And I’m not nearly as pleased as I was depressed; & yet in a state of security; fate cannot touch me; the reviewers may snap; & the sales decrease. What I had feared was that I was dismissed as negligible.

Roger again last night, scraping at his woodcuts while I sewed; the sound like that of a large pertinacious rat. We live in stirring times. Here is Ralph saying that Michael Davies has enlisted to protect the country, against the miners, & McIver is offered £1 exs. by government for himself & car, which he will accept. Yet no one—so far as I know—really believes that we are in for anything. It will be tided over. Our cellars will be full; our larders too. Nothing is going to upset us. People in a century will say how terrible it all was. And I walked past Downing St yesterday & saw a few men in cabs, a few men with despatch boxes, orderly public watching, wreaths being laid on the Cenotaph. Lytton’s book already selling 5 thousand copies, & the weather perfect."
1921.04.13,"Now I note the latest symptom—complete absence of jealousy. What I mean is that I shall feel instantly warm & pleased (not only after an hour & a sharp pang) if there’s a long & sound & appreciative review of L. in the Lit Sup tomorrow. I think this is perfectly true. Most people, though, would not have to write this down. I suppose I had a qualm or two. No time for more than this interesting & important statement. Rather to our respite, Roger is away for the night after a fair bust up yesterday—Ray Pippa Saxon all together—& I must read my book. A strike now proclaimed for Friday, & we had just planned to go to Monks."
1921.04.15,"I have been lying recumbent all day reading Carlyle, & now Macaulay, first to see if Carlyle wrote better than Lytton, then to see if Macaulay sells better. Carlyle (reminiscences) is more colloquial & scrappy than I remembered, but he has his merits.—more punch in his phrase than in Lytton’s. I don’t count this as my judgment though, since I was half asleep, & haven’t done more than half Vic yet. Lytton rang up this morning to ask for Roger, & I asked him about his book. “Are you smothered in laurels” “Well, rather depressed,” he said, & so he sounded. “I’m in the middle; & then I shall write to you about it” “And I’m writing to you about yours” he answered. “We will be candid” I said. “When shall I see you? Never, presumably.” Anyday next week would do, he said,—he is coming to tea & dinner on Wednesday. So fame hasn’t done him much harm. He’s sold, so they say, 5,000 copies this week, & another edition is printing. I have sold just 300. Well, but that doesn’t prove my immortality, as I insinuate. The truth is I have no notion of my standing, or of Lytton’s. One ought to write more of this occasion, since I suppose in 20 years’ time the publication of Queen Victoria will be thought an important matter; but these things aren’t important to us. They say he’s been given a bust of Prince Albert & a photograph of the Queen by a spectacle maker. And Max Beerbohm is doing a caricature of him, & altogether he’s a solid celebrity, one of our leading writers, not merely the hero of one book which might not be repeated. Ralph seems willing to go on with our printing, though orders have again sunk low. No review of Tchekhov or L. yet; only shorter mention by donkey Dalton I suppose in the Lit. Sup. This is the first free time for reading I’ve had for an age,—I shall lavish it all on Q.V. & must now go & fetch her, since of course Roger borrows her to read o’nights.

A queer sort of stillness seems already settling down on us, as of Sunday. This is the foreboding of the General Strike. We have put off going to Rodmell. Marjorie’s party is put off. L. has just come in with a paper which says that nothing has been done to patch up the strike. Therefore at 10 tonight, unless something happens meanwhile, all trains, trams, buses, mines, & perhaps electric light works come to an end. The servants have been to the Coops & brought back a weeks groceries. We have a bundle of candles. Our most serious lack is coal, as Nelly forgot to order any. We burn coke in the drawing room & cook on gas. Still, Heaven knows why, I don’t believe the strike will happen."
1921.04.17,"And I was perfectly right. The strike didn’t happen. About 7 o’clock L. rang up Margaret & heard that the Triple Alliance had split: the railwaymen & transport workers refusing to go on with it, & leaving the miners by themselves. Nothing is yet accurately known. Presumably the miners will have to give in,* * They haven’t given in yet. May 9th & I shall get my hot bath, bake home made bread again; yet it seems a pity somehow—if they’re to be forced back & the mine owners triumphant. I think this is my genuine feeling, though not very profound. It is fairly obvious that working people are well enough satisfied to prefer going on working; I remember the pleasure of the railwaymen when they started running about platforms & leaning out of engines again.

Yesterday we had our avenue walk—the first for a long while; & L. explained the plan of his new book—a revised version of the Wandering Jew. Very original & solid, it seemed to me; & like a good business man, I pressed him to promise it for the press. Its true that sales & reviews flag, & I much doubt if M. & T. will sell 500, or cover expenses. But I want to push on with it nevertheless; & a solid big book like L.’s is essential. We discussed all this walking down the Avenue; looking in at the iron gates of Ham House, & so home to tea, & a Russian lesson with Kot, & now I must write to Lytton & polish off a review. Always these last paragraphs floor me."
1921.04.18,"Just back from lunching with a Cabinet Minister. I mean, of course, Herbert Fisher. We think he asked us in order to apologise for—everything. He said he had neither the physical force nor the combativeness to carry things through. He said he hated Parliament. A political life is dull, & wastes all one’s time he said; one is always listening to dull speeches, frittering time away. He leaves home at 10, gets back at 11 p.m. & then has a bundle of papers to go through. The upshot of it all was that he couldn’t be blamed for his conduct about Ireland. And then he was careful to explain that the public is ridiculously in the dark about everything. Only the cabinet knows the true spring & source of things he said. That is the only solace of the work. A flood tide of business flows incessantly from all quarters of the world through Downing Street; & there are a few miserable men trying desperately to deal with it. They have to make tremendous decisions with insufficient evidence on the spur of the moment. Then he pulled himself up, & said, solemnly, that he is going to Geneva to initiate peace—disarmament. “You are the great authority upon that, I understand”, he said to Leonard. Anyhow I confess it seemed to me, sitting opposite to Leonard in that brown ugly room with its autotypes of Dutch pictures & Aunt Mary on a donkey, that Leonard was an authority & Herbert a thin-shredded thread paper of a man, whose brain has been harrowed in to sandy streaks like his hair. Never was there a thinner lighter airier specimen I thought; his words without body, & his head cocked at a queer angle, & his hands gesticulating, & his eyes so blue, but almost vacant, & cheerful colourless words, slightly mannered & brushed up in conformity with some official standard of culture—I daresay Mr Balfour talks something like that. But after mouthing his meaning behold; it flew away like thistledown, & it appeared that this Cabinet Minister & representative of Great Britain in whose hands are armies & navies was dry & empty again—& asking me colloquially whether I remembered Aunt Mary on the donkey, which I did. ‘The donkey is too small’, I said ‘And the horse has no ears,’ he added. ‘Watts has come down in the world’ I said, feeling astonishingly young & juicy beside him.

“Yes, he said. I daresay: But I feel that the man who painted that picture was a great man—not a great painter, perhaps, but a great man.” After which he descended as usual to badinage about the arts; & praised a Mr Munnings: wonderful pictures of horses; landscapes in the 18th century style behind them. “Thats what I like—the 18th century style—old Crome & Cotman. Well, Munnings is that style—worth going to the Royal Academy to see—quite a young fellow—fought through the war.” But modern art he didn’t care for; & we walked down Victoria Street to the House of Commons; & he said he was reading Southey’s Letters—“first rate reading. There’s a beautiful description of winter. Now who are our promising litterateurs?” I said Joyce. Never heard of Joyce. So we parted, Herbert very amiable, grey & distinguished, in his pea-jacket, going to tackle the liquor bill, & envying us very much, he said, writing books at Richmond. And then we ran into Will Vaughan at the London Library, portly & hearty, & keeping up a laugh like an old sea-captains all the time he talked. Indeed, we had nothing to say."
1921.04.29,"A great deal to say, I suppose: a great many portraits to sketch; conversations to write down; & reflections to work in—had I time; which I have not (& that sentence reminds me that I mean to read Marvell.) But every afternoon for a week I’ve been up to the AEolian Hall; taken my seat right at the back; put my bag on the floor & listened to Beethoven quartets. Do I dare say listened? Well, but if one gets a lot of pleasure, really divine pleasure, & knows the tunes, & only occasionally thinks of other things—surely I may say listened. We are just back from the 5th: & I had my hand clasped by Lady Cromer in the street: we had tea with Lytton, Carrington & Ralph.

I ought to say something of Lytton. I have seen him oftener these last days than for a whole year perhaps. We have talked about his book & my book. This particular conversation took place in Verreys: gilt feathers: mirrors: blue walls & Lytton & I taking our tea & brioche in a corner: we must have sat well over an hour.

“And I woke last night & wondered where to place you” I said. “There’s St Simon & La Bruyère.

Oh God, he groaned.

And Macaulay I added.

“Yes, Macaulay” he said. “A little better than Macaulay.”

But not his mass, I insisted. More civilisation of course. And then you’ve only written short books.

I’m going to do George the IVth next, he said.

Well but your place, I insisted.

And yours he asked

“I’m the ‘ablest of living women novelists’” I said—So the British weekly says.

“You influence me” he said.

And he said he could always recognise my writing though I wrote so many different styles, “which is the result of hard work” I insisted. And then we discussed historians: Gibbon: a kind of Henry James, I volunteered. Oh dear no—not in the least he said.

“He has a point of view & sticks to it” I said. “And so do you. I wobble.” But what is Gibbon?

Oh he’s there all right; Lytton said. Forster says he’s an Imp⁠[?]. But he hadn’t many views. He believed in ‘virtue’ perhaps.

A beautiful word, I said.

But just read how the hordes of barbarians devastated the City. Its marvellous. True, he was queer about the Early Xtians—didn’t see anything in them at all. But read him. I’m going to next October. And I’m going to Florence, & I shall be very lonely in the evenings.

The French have influenced you more than the English, I suppose, I said.

Yes. I have their definiteness. I’m formed.

I compared you with Carlyle the other day, I said. I read the Reminiscences. Well they’re the chatter of an old toothless grave digger compared with you: only then he has phrases.

Ah yes, he has them, said Lytton. But I read him to Norton & James the other day, & they shouted—they wouldn’t have it. I’m a little anxious though about ‘mass’. That’s my danger is it?

Yes: You may cut too fine I said. But its a magnificent subject—George the IVth—& what fun, setting to work on it.

And your novel?

Oh I put in my hand & rummage in the bran pie. Thats whats so wonderful. And its all different.

Yes. I’m 20 people.

But one sees the whole from the outside.

The worst of George IVth is that no one mentions the facts I want. History must be written all over again. Its all morality—

& battles, I added.

And then we walked through the streets together, for I had to buy coffee."
1921.05.03,"Hamilton Fyfe in the Daily Mail says that Leonard’s story P. & S. will rank with the great stories of the world. Am I jealous? Only momentarily. But the odd thing is—the idiotic thing—is that I immediately think myself a failure—imagine myself peculiarly lacking in the qualities L. has. I feel fine drawn, misty, attenuated, inhuman, bloodless & niggling out trifles that don’t move people. ‘Limbo’ is my sphere; so they say in the Daily News. Then Romer Wilson has brought out a novel—to which Squire will certainly give the he did Hawthornden prize, thus robbing Katherine of it: so I have some cause for pleasure. I write this purposely, to shame it out of me. A full stop in Jacob, owing partly to depression. But I must pull together & finish it off. I can’t read it as it is.

We had Oliver & Saxon to dinner on Sunday; & I went to tea with Nessa on Saturday; & yesterday we were in London at the New Statesman office: & I bought Eliot on Prose; & Romer Wilson;—all of which I note to put off doing my Russian; I suppose: for I see I am going to say nothing sensible or witty or profound. And yet I comfort myself with the reflection that there’s no knowing what won’t interest old Virginia one of these days."
1921.05.09,"Well, but I assure you, when Virginia’s old, no one will be talking of Romer Wilson. What a book! What a perfect example of the faux bon: every attitude, scene & word, I should say matched in the old word shop of the minor poets: never a single thing seen for herself, or dared; & yet by taking all the scenery & supplying the appropriate words she has Squire, Lynd, & Turner by the heel: another proof that what people dread is being made to feel anything: a certain kind of rhapsody makes them feel wild & adventurous; & they then make out that this is passion & poetry—so thankful to be let off the genuine thing.

Yesterday I had tea with Lady Cromer, & I observe that she’s more Lady Cromer in her own drawing room than met casually in the street. Supported by her pretty chinzes, large airy rooms, family portraits by Watts & Sargent—green stained wood, parquet floors, & young bumpkin Greek God dragoon of a son she is the English Countess again: thus rather a bore, I’ve come to think. Do I travel to Finchley Rd on a Sunday missing my chocolate cake merely to exchange views with Lady Cromer upon the niceness of the Bruce Richmonds, the charm of St John’s Wood, the good qualities of the French—to hear Mr Keynes called ‘very clever’ & Lytton Strachey ‘very clever’ & myself very good to have come there? I cant get it right though. Time was when I thought this breeding & personality so distinguished & somehow celestial that it carried everything off. Now I’m more exacting: after all shes a little middle class: & then the personal goodness attitude restrains me. Doing good to peoples cooks if you’re Lady Cromer seems to me an easy way to waste time agreeably. Barbara at the club today, stunned with the problem of life, thoroughly in for it, & scarcely able to deal with it, appeared to me more interesting—thats it perhaps—than Lady Cromer swimming over the waves. But she’s a nice woman: a character: beautiful too: so upright, firm, possessed—& then that queer old way of bending her head on one side & falling half absentminded as she talks, looking out of the window; her voice so charmingly accented, her eyes half closed. I got home to find Mr Brenton of Barnes; & according to his code one asks people kindly after their health, & comes back to shake hands, very punctiliously; & the poor man is sunk cheeked, spotted, ugly: drab: yet L. says interesting, & he should judge having had 3 hours of him! An order for 25 stories of the East today from S⁠[imkin]. & M⁠[arshall]."
1921.05.15,"Whit Sunday—dull, wet, & cold; so that on the whole we dont blame the coal strike for keeping us here over the fire instead of Monks House. Moreover, L. has a chill in his inside, & sits rather dismally with his head in his hand, poor man, allowed no tea or coffee. Its that I should mind—all the romance of the day dulled. By this time I think Carrington will have made up her mind one way or t’other. She must have had an odious Sunday. But still she must make up her mind. So I told Ralph on Friday, broaching that topic after all these months of silence. He did it himself, rather, by telling me of his gloom of the night before: his loneliness. “I wished for my mother” he said. “Though she irritates me, & I could tell her nothing.” He was very shrewd & bitter about C. “She thinks herself one of the little friends of all the world” he said. Then he said she was selfish, untruthful, & quite indifferent to his suffering. So people in love always turn & rend the loved, with considerable insight too. He was speaking the truth largely. But I expect he was biassed; & also I expect—& indeed told him—that he is a bit of an ogre & tyrant. He wants more control than I should care to give—control I mean of the body & mind & time & thoughts of his loved. There’s his danger & her risk; so I don’t much envy her making up her mind this wet Whit Sunday.

I read 4 pages of sneer & condescending praise of me in the Dial the other day. Oddly enough, I have drawn the sting of it by deciding to print it among my puffs, where it will come in beautifully. The Dial is everything honest vigorous & advanced; so I ought to feel crushed. L. went on selling all last week. I very slowly dribble. Tchekhov is at a standstill. But we hear that never was there such a season for all commodities, in proof of which not a picture at the London Group was sold 2 days ago, though many are worth buying. And did I say?—we propose to spend £1000 a year upon a tea shop, book shop, gallery in Bond Street. After all, why not? I like rummaging in the great Bran pie, as I’ve said before: thus we rout middle age for one thing; for another, such queer specimens come out of it. There was Mr Reginald Morris on the hearthrug the other day—a very bad poet from Hounslow."
1921.05.23,"So Carrington did make up her mind to become Partridge—no, that is precisely what she is determined not to do; & signs herself aggressively Carrington for ever. If people ever took advice I should feel a little responsible for making up Ralph’s mind. I mean I am not sure that this marriage is not more risky than most. Certainly she is not in love; & he has the obdurate Anglo Indian in him. But still, if she couldn’t face the prospect of a week end breach, or of a journey alone to Italy, she had no alternative. So they were married on Saturday. The day before Michael Davies was drowned bathing at Oxford. Life does this sort of thing too habitually—I begin to feel bored, like a passenger thrown from side to side of a ship. I dont describe what I feel: something of anger at the unreason of it; & something of—not indifference, no: but as if one knew by this time how things go: first these marriages, at the same moment deaths. Just from not knowing how to swim he pulled another young man down, & now at the age of 21 it’s all over for both of them. And then in this fine weather too. We have been to Rodmell, & as usual I come home depressed—for no reason. Merely moods. Have other people as many as I have? That I shall never know. And sometimes I suppose that even if I came to the end of my incessant search into what people are & feel I should know nothing still. I mean I go on thinking in the belief that if one thinks about it enough one comes to some conclusion. That I begin to judge doubtful. I was thinking about this in the Strand today—wondering whether I am after some play or novel, as I go on ferreting away. But I’m too scatterbrained to get it right. I was up in the Strand with 12 copies of Monday or Tuesday; so that sells a little; & 2 goslings, to be sent to Lewes; & my review of Patmore for the Times; & then caught a train home, put my great lupins & peonies in water, & should now settle with concentration to my book. But which book? I’ve a notion of reading masterpieces only; for I’ve read literature in bulk so long. Now I think’s the time to read like an expert. Then I’m wondering how to shape my Reading book; the more I read of other peoples criticism the more I trifle; can’t decide; nor need I just yet. But how I enjoy the exercise of my wits upon literature—reading it as literature. And I think I can do this the better for having read through such a lot of lives, criticisms, every sort of thing.

We had dinner to report Desmond’s talk the other night. He talked admirably for the purpose, but less intimately which was natural; & yet I hate people to talk admirably, as if they were dining out. There was Roger, & Molly & good Miss Green. That’s my d——d condescension—I cant help condescending to very plain poor serviceable women, & then they bob up as happy as grigs & twice as able as I am."
1921.05.26,"My evening being ruined by Gravé as usual—I mean by non-Gravé—I mean she said she was coming at 6 & its 6.30—I may as well wreak my temper, write out my fidgets, in this book. Such is the constitution of my brain that I can settle to nothing if I’m waiting. This doesn’t want settling to. Haven’t I schooled my diary well? It takes what it can get & is thankful.

I sat in Gordon Square yesterday for an hour & a half talking to Maynard. Sometimes I wish I put down what people say instead of describing them. The difficulty is that they say so little. Maynard said he liked praise; & always wanted to boast. He said that many men marry in order to have a wife to boast to. But, I said, its odd that one boasts considering that no one is ever taken in by it. Its odd too that you, of all people, should want praise. You & Lytton are passed beyond boasting—which is the supreme Triumph. There you sit & say nothing. I love praise, he said. I want it for the things I’m doubtful about. Then we got upon publishing, & the Hogarth press; & novels. Why should they explain what bus he took? he asked. And why shouldn’t Mrs Hilbery be sometimes the daughter of Katherine. Oh its a dull book, I know, I said; but don’t you see you must put it all in before you can leave out. The best thing you ever did, he said, was your Memoir on George. You should pretend to write about real people & make it all up—I was dashed of course. (& oh dear what nonsense—for if George is my climax I’m a mere scribbler). What else did we talk about? He was going to some official dinner. He gets £120 for an article—"
1921.06.02,"But this was written a week ago, today being the day after Derby Day, the very height of the season, I suppose: anyhow of leaf & flower.

People turn up regularly though with little planning on our part. Madge [Vaughan] on Friday; Kot on Saturday; Roger; Fredegond; Mr Reginald Morris. Will these names recover anything in 10 years time of the last week of May 1921? I wish I had the same record of 10 years back, when I was a young woman—only then one can’t scribble. One takes thought. One gets it too literal.

Madge asked to come; so we had her. She is curiously changed. She has become ordinary. Middle age has thickened her lines, & deepened her colour. In her mind she is grown cheerful, & commonplace. I notice now that her forehead is oddly pinched at the top. She said of herself that she was stunted—which expresses it. She has never grown up, but lived somewhere under shelter, unchastised, talking a great deal about life, but not facing it. Oh she did talk about life—always with reference to herself, which makes the mind squint. She sees nothing in itself. So we vacillated between ‘life’ & Will: ‘my life’: ‘my odd nature’, ‘I have no brain’ ‘I am very psychological’. But then I ought to have broken away, & so on; but as it is quite obvious that she is rich, successful, & happy, these complaints which make the staple of her talk, lack substance; & she easily slides into gossip, & repetition. Indeed you can’t keep her to poetry, kitchen, love, art, or children for more than a minute. Yet she has her gaiety & her vitality which protect one from the worst boredom. But not Leonard nor Roger. They were out of hand with misery. And this was the woman I adored! I see myself now standing in the night nursery at Hyde Park Gate, washing my hands, & saying to myself “At this moment she is actually under this roof.”

Fredegond came, all in black (& she dresses very badly). Uncle Hervey is dead, she said. And she was off to bury him, but couldn’t find a train (the strike, you see, is still on.) Hervey Fisher was the genius of our youth; & the only fruit of it is a volume of stories which are neither better nor worse than what one reads on a journey in a Red Magazine. They said he was dropped by his nurse; & so for 52 years, poor man, he has been plagued with illness; has been mad; has never done anything he liked, I suppose, even his marriage being called off by Aunt Mary."
1921.06.05,"Poor Hervey Fisher has been buried a week, & is as if he had never been, I suppose: though if I chose I could imagine some feelings on the part of Adeline. Fredegond told us that he once lost his temper with Herbert, walked up to him & licked his eyelashes!

We went to Miss Royde Smith’s party on Thursday to discuss Ireland. Never did I see a less attractive woman than Naomi. Her face might have been cut out of cardboard by blunt scissors. I fixed her with my eye. She fixed me with hers. But I got to the bottom of hers & jumped on the rock in a second. She is slightly furred too; dressed à la 1860; swinging ear rings, skirt in balloons; & a body that billows out but perfectly hard. There she sat in complete command. Here she had her world round her. It was a queer mixture of the intelligent & the respectable. There were two clergymen. They made jokes, which were well within the bounds of decency. My translation of their attitude would be “See how free & playful & advanced we are—yet we have not sacrificed niceness. We are people of the world. Very open minded. Not mere intellectuals—no—look how nicely we dress.” Lady Rhondda was more plain dealing I thought; a solid bull dog, something after Ray’s pattern. I detest the mixture of ideas & South Kensington. Then Rose [Macaulay] chipped in with her witticism all in character at which the clergyman, Duncan Jones, said ‘Oh Rose!’ & everyone laughed loud, as if Rose had done the thing they expected. Yes, I disliked it all a good deal—& the furniture & the pictures—the marriage of conventionality & the Saturday Westminster. I talked to Robert Lynd—& I didn’t much care for him. He is a true journalist—all spent in clever words, elongated, exhausted, voluble, with the cloudy shifty look in the eyes which comes of catering perpetually for the Daily News. I can fancy him much liked. There’s no bite about these people. I tried to be elderly & broad minded. I thought of Bloomsbury. But then in Bloomsbury you would come up against something hard—a Maynard, or a Lytton, or even Clive.

Murry has written against our Tchekhov in the Nation. As for Kot, yesterday he couldn’t keep his seat for fury. He verged on the voice & language of the public house—He said the sort of thing I’ve heard men say before they kick each other out. Is Murry “a damned swindler”? Suppose we admired Murry’s writing, would he change his tune? In my theory he’s all parched for praise—run mad for lack of it. Yet it goes against my psychology to think people scoundrels. Moreover they’re more interesting if you can keep the stew on the boil. I think he’s a greater mix than the rest of us. I don’t know—at this moment I incline to think him a damned swindler—only a swindler so plausible that he’ll become Professor of English literature in the University of Oxford."
1921.06.07,"About an hour after writing this in came Eliot, & the first or third thing Eliot said was “Murry has been having tea with me—in fact he stayed a very long time, rolling another cigarette, & trying to say something, but he did not say it.” So then L. burst out, & told him about the Tchekhov article; & this was no news to Eliot, who said “When we first knew each other we seemed to be becoming very friendly; but then we realised that we were fundamentally antagonistic—We had nothing to say today. There seemed to be nothing to be said.”

“What did you say?” I asked.

“He talked mostly about himself. He said the Athenaeum had almost done for him. He got nothing from going into society except exhaustion—“I shan’t do anything till I’m 50 or 60” he said”. Eliot rolled his head & his eyes in imitation of Murry at this. “He can’t hold his own with other people. Thats why he doesn’t like going out.” I repeated my phrase “He’s parched with vanity;” “He will be very successful” said Eliot. “He’s been giving 6 lectures on style at Oxford—as though it were a duty. He takes the crown as soon as he’s offered it. But he’s not satisfied with that.”

“No, he wants us & you & Lytton to praise his poetry;”

“I’ve talked to him about his writing: I’ve never been able to praise it.”

Literature is the devil, I said (meaning for the character).

He agreed.

Leonard said how he’d never met a worse man than Murry. That was the gist of what Eliot said; I think indeed his opinion is black at all points; & he knows him, & his methods better than we do. Strange to know a bad man!

The thing is that he is always trying to bias himself against his badness—hence his confessions, his poses, & also, so Eliot said, these hysterical admirations for great men who have what he lacks.

“But never for his contemporaries—” I said.

“He used to lament the decay of D. H. Lawrence” Eliot said.

“He is a damned swine”—said L. & L. has written in this sense on a postcard to Sydney inviting him to play chess & discuss Murry.

Eliot, by the way, saw no truth in Murry’s article.

“He is extremely clever” he said.

“But you don’t mean that in a good sense”, I said.

“Oh no: not at all.”

Now I think its true that Eliot had wished us to open our eyes about Murry. He certainly agreed to all criticisms, & made me feel that he could stress them & add facts if he chose. I think it probable that one of Murry’s devices was to crab us both to Eliot, in his oblique way; & to insinuate that my writing was trivial, & so on.

“No one has any scope”—that was one of his phrases.

It will be interesting to watch his career to the high seat of authority. Unless, as L. says, he commits a felony. Probably in one word Eliot thinks him dishonest through & through.

And Eliot astounded me by praising Monday & Tuesday! This really delighted me. He picked out the String Quartet, especially the end of it. “Very good” he said, & meant it, I think. The Unwritten Novel he thought not successful: Haunted House “extremely interesting”. It pleases me to think I could discuss my writing openly with him. And I was stoical; & I write without cringing (allow me these words of commendation!) Ulysses he says is prodigious.

MONKS HOUSE, RODMELL"
1921.08.08,"What a gap! How it would have astounded me to be told when I wrote the last word here, on June 7th, that within a week I should be in bed, & not entirely out of it till the 6th of August—two whole months rubbed out—These, this morning, the first words I have written—to call writing—for 60 days; & those days spent in wearisome headache, jumping pulse, aching back, frets, fidgets, lying awake, sleeping draughts, sedatives, digitalis, going for a little walk, & plunging back into bed again—all the horrors of the dark cupboard of illness once more displayed for my diversion. Let me make a vow that this shall never, never, happen again; & then confess that there are some compensations. To be tired & authorised to lie in bed is pleasant; then, scribbling 365 days of the year as I do, merely to receive without agitation of my right hand in giving out is salutary. I feel that I can take stock of things in a leisurely way. Then the dark underworld has its fascinations as well as its terrors; & then sometimes I compare the fundamental security of my life in all (here Mrs Dedman interrupts for 15 minutes) storms (perhaps I meant) with its old fearfully random condition—

Later, I had my visitors, one every day; so that I saw more people than normally even. Perhaps in future I shall adopt this method more than I have done. Roger, Lytton, Nessa, Duncan, Dorothy Bussy, Pippa, Carrington, James & Alix—all these came; & were as detached portraits—cut out, emphatic, seen thus separately compared with the usual way of seeing them in crowds. Lytton, I note, is more than ever affectionate. One must be, I think, if one is famous. One must say to one’s old friends “All my celebrity is nothing—nothing—compared with this” And that was what he did say too. We were talking about love. He said he had suffered tortures from D⁠[uncan], & H⁠[enry]. L⁠[amb]. had wished to marry them & settle down, had been refused; & now can love no more. “It is madness—” he said. “One cannot treat lovers like rational people” this was said of Ralph’s vagaries. “That won’t happen to us again” “Yet it is love that still matters—for look at you, you’ve got fame enough—I sometimes see my name in the papers—yet that is nothing.” “You mean this—he said—indicating the 3 of us sitting in the window—Oh yes, this is what matters—one’s friends.”"
1921.08.09,"Then, as I say, there was Roger, with 20 holes in his teeth to be stopped; & I thought his teeth were all of soulless bone, as some of mine are; & now I hear that he has mercurial poisoning from these stoppings in Paris. There’s no doubt we are a weakly set of people; but then they i.e. Nessa &c have had a splendid summer of dissipation. I dont envy it: I dont want it; far far away it seems; I want nothing but quiet & an active brain. Indeed I am reading Hardy for my famous article—the one I’m always talking about. I ransack public libraries & find them full of sunk treasure. Yet I have a worm of uncertainty moving at the foundations of this pleasant life—Allison, when we asked him to cut a branch in the field, replied that he has sold the field for building purposes to a friend. So I shall have Jack Squire in a poetical villa within a hundred yards. As it is I see Shanks’ paper stand at his cottage window when I walk down my garden path; & cultivated voices & a cultivated dog barking wake us on Sunday mornings. The truth is, Rodmell is a colony for Georgian poets, & though I am all for letting live, & not reading their works, it is hard & indeed intolerable that I should have to let them live next door to me. We have even answered an advertisement about a house near Arundel; & paced out a meadow with a wonderful view, & imagined a house there. But L. says we are too old to build a house.

If one goes into the matter, & considers the good of the majority, Allinson’s descent upon Rodmell is probably a benefit. He puts up gates & hedges, mends cottages, ploughs fields, owns a telephone, gives teas in the barn, & I suppose finds work & does kindnesses when old Stacey would have been stingy & too much of a rustic to imagine a better state of things. Old Stacey it is said drank himself to death, & had to be buried straight away—which will not happen to Allinson. However for my purposes farmers who drink, & lounge about like Mr Smith, muddy & ruddy & obsolete are far preferable to Allinson who looks as if he had been dressed by one of the advertisers in his own Field."
1921.08.10,"But how is one to arrive at the truth? I have changed the Daily News for the Morning Post. The proportions of the world at once become utterly different. The M.P. has the largest letters & the double column devoted to the murder of Mrs Lindsay; anglo Indians, Anglo Scots, & retired old men & patriotic old ladies write letter after letter to deplore the state of the country; applaud the M.P., the only faithful standard bearer left. They lament the downfall of England, which is flourishing as usual in the D.N.; hardly spotted at all in the D.H. The heroes of the day in the Herald are the unemployed who rioted. The M.P. ignores them altogether. But the D.N. has become a vivacious scrapbag. News is cut up into agreeable scraps, & written in words of one syllable. I may well ask, what is truth? And I cant ask it in my natural tones, since my lips are wet with Edmund Gosse. How often have I said that I would never read anyone before beginning to write? The book came at breakfast, & I fell. He is one of the respectables. If Shelley had come before him now G. would have been distressed, though interested in young men of good birth. But how low in tone it all is—purred out by the firesides of Dowagers. That is not quite true, seeing that he has some sturdiness, some independence, & some love of letters. The peculiar combination of suavity, gravity, malignity & common sense always repels me. Once he sat next me & did not speak until he had an audience. Lytton, meeting him in ducal society, says he is very amusing.

Of private news, I have little, yet a thousand small events seem in progress. The time flies. I look at my watch & find it eleven. I’ve wasted 30 minutes gossiping with Mrs Dedman. L. has his rash on his arm from clearing the horrid little arch of ivy. We have bought the Dedmans’ chickens. I find the eggs with a thrill of [word illegible]—warm, smooth, with a feather or so stuck to them. The servants, or rather the angelic couple of attached familiars, return tomorrow; & are welcome for the first time. Allison (for he is neither Addison nor Allinson) is away. I pray daily for his bankruptcy, or that his wife may being dishonour upon his name."
1921.08.11,"A fortnight already gone. It goes too quick—too quick. If only one could sip slowly & relish every grain of every hour! For, to speak the truth, I’ve thought of making my will for the first time during these past weeks. Sometimes it seems to me that I shall never write out all the books I have in my head, because of the strain. The devilish thing about writing is that it calls upon every nerve to hold itself taut. That is exactly what I cannot do—Now if it were painting or scribbling music or making patchwork quilts or mud pies, it wouldnt’ matter.

The first thing that happened when we came here was that a branch blew down off Allison’s tree. It lies with its branches standing up in the air, on a sloping part of the meadow, & the children of the cottages collect every morning & swing from rope, or are twirled round & round, till dark. A girl of 12 superintends, & I see her at work swinging the small children hour after hour. Sometimes they cry; sometimes quarrel; but the amusement lasts them. I suppose Julian & Quentin would soon be tired of it. No nurse would consent to stand there swinging them.

In the evening sometimes there’s a game of stoolball. I caught them at it, as I stood in the road beneath, pink & blue & red & yellow frocks raised above me, & nothing behind them but the vast Asheham hills—a sight too beautiful for one pair of eyes. Instinctively I want someone to catch my overflow of pleasure."
1921.08.13,"“Coleridge was as little fitted for action as Lamb, but on a different account. His person was of a good height, but as sluggish & solid as the other’s was light & fragile. He had, perhaps, suffered it to look old before its time, for want of exercise. His hair was white at 50; & as he generally dressed in black, & had a very tranquil demeanour, his appearance was gentlemanly, & for several years before his death was reverend. Nevertheless, there was something invincibly young in the look of his face. It was round & fresh-coloured, with agreeable features, & an open, indolent, good natured mouth. This boy-like expression was very becoming in one who dreamed & speculated as he did when he was really a boy, & who passed his life apart from the rest of the world, with a book, & his flowers. His forehead was prodigious,—a great piece of placid marble;—& his fine eyes, in which all the activity of his mind seemed to concentrate, moved under it with a sprightly ease, as if it was a pastime to them to carry all that thought.

“And it was pastime. Hazlitt said, that Coleridge’s genius appeared to him like a spirit, all head & wings, eternally floating about in etherialities. He gave me a different impression. I fancied him a good natured wizard, very fond of earth, & conscious of reposing with weight enough in his easy chair, but able to conjure his etherialities about him in the twinkling of an eye. He cd. also change them by thousands, & dismiss them as easily when his dinner came. It was a mighty intellect put upon a sensual body; & the reason why he did little more with it than talk & dream was, that it is agreeable to such a body to do little else. I do not mean that C. was a sensualist in an ill sense….” which is all that I can take the trouble to quote from Leigh Hunt’s memoirs vol 2 page 223, supposing I should want to cook this up again somewhere. L.H. was our spiritual grandfather, a free man. One could have spoken to him as to Desmond. A light man, I daresay, but civilised, much more so than my grandfather in the flesh. These free, vigorous spirits advance the world, & when one lights on them in the strange waste of the past one says Ah you’re my sort—a great compliment. Most people who died 100 years ago are like strangers. One is polite & uneasy with them. Shelley died with H.’s copy of Lamia in his hand. H. wd. receive it back from no other, & so burnt it on the pyre. Going home from the funeral? H. & Byron laughed till they split. This is human nature, & H. doesn’t mind owning to it. Then I like his inquisitive human sympathies: history so dull because of its battles & laws; & sea voyages in books so dull because the traveller will describe beauties instead of going into the cabins & saying what the sailors looked like, wore, eat, said; how they behaved.

Lady Carlisle is dead. One likes people much better when theyre battered down by a prodigious seige of misfortune than when they triumph. Such a stock of hope & gifts she set out with, & lost everything (so they say) & died of sleepy sickness, her 5 sons dead before her, & the war crushing her hope for humanity."
1921.08.17,"To while away the time till L. comes in, from London, Fergusson, office, &c, I may as well scribble. Really I think my scribbling is coming back. Here I have spent the whole day, off & on, making up an article—for Squire perhaps, because he wants a story, & because Mrs Hawkesford has told Mrs Thomsett that I am one of the, if not the, cleverest women in England. It’s not nerve power so much as praise that has lacked, perhaps.

Yesterday I was seized with the flux, as the Bible has it, Dr Vallence was fetched, came after dinner, & paid a call. I wish I could write down his conversation—A mild, heavy lidded, little elderly man, son of a Lewes Dr, has always lived here, existing on a few broad medical truths learnt years ago, which he applies conscientiously; he can speak French, as it were, in words of one syllable. As both L. & I knew a good deal more than he did we got upon general topics—old Verrall, & how he starved himself purposely to death. “I could have had him sent away,” said Dr. V meditatively “He had been away once. His sisters away to this day—quite crazy, I believe—A bad family—very bad. I sat with him in your sitting room. We had to sit right into the chimney to get warm. I tried to interest him in chess. No. He didn’t seem able to take an interest in anything. But he was too old—too weak. I couldn’t send him away.” So he starved himself to death, pottering about this garden.

Crossing his knees, & touching his little moustache meditatively now & then, V. then asked me if I did anything? (He thought me a chronic invalid, & fine lady). I said I wrote—“What novels?—light things?” Yes, novels. “I have another lady novelist among my patients—Mrs Dudedny. I’ve had to buck her up—to fulfil a contract, a contract for a new novel—She finds Lewes very noisy. And then we have Marion Crawford…. But Mr Dudedny is the puzzle king. Give him any puzzle—he’ll tell you the answer. He makes up the sort of puzzles shops print on their menus. He writes columns in the papers about puzzles.”

“Did he help to answer puzzles in the war?” I asked.

“Well I dont know about that. But a great many soldiers wrote to him—the puzzle king.” Here he crossed his legs the opposite way. Finally he went, & invited L. to join the Lewes chess club, which I should very much like to attend myself, these glimpses into different groups always fascinating me intolerably, for I shall never join the party of Dr Vallence & the puzzle king.

I shall never … has a kind of meaning, alas. For L. has been to see Allison, & there is no doubt that our fate is the worst possible. Ted Hunter is going to build his cottage, so far as we can tell, right against the orchard wall. He is going to make a proper road, & so far as I can see, the flats will be untenable. What to do we cannot decide. And this just as we were getting settled in to our liking—& with the added bitterness that we might, twice over, have bought the field & the terrace & saved the loveliest of views for ever."
1921.08.18,"Nothing to record; only an intolerable fit of the fidgets to write away. Here I am chained to my rock: forced to do nothing; doomed to let every worry, spite, irritation & obsession scratch & claw & come again. This is to say that I may not walk, & must not work. Whatever book I read bubbles up in my mind as part of an article I want to write. No one in the whole of Sussex is so miserable as I am; or so conscious of an infinite capacity of enjoyment horded in me, could I use it. The sun streams (no: never streams floods rather) down upon all the yellow fields & the long low barns; & what wouldn’t I give to be coming through Firle woods, dusty & hot, with my nose turned home, every muscle tired, & the brain laid up in sweet lavender, so sane & cool, & ripe for the morrows task. How I should notice everything—the phrase for it coming the moment after & fitting like a glove; & then on the dusty road, as I ground my pedals, so my story would begin telling itself; & then the sun would be down, & home, & some bout of poetry after dinner, half read, half lived, as if the flesh were dissolved & through it the flowers burst red & white.

There! I’ve written out half my irritation. I hear poor L. driving the lawn mower up & down, for a wife like I am should have a label to her cage. She bites! And he spent all yesterday running round London for me. Still if one is Prometheus, if the rock is hard & the gadflies pungent, gratitude, affection, none of the nobler feelings have sway. And so this August is wasted.

Only the thought of people suffering more than I do at all consoles; & that is an aberration of egotism, I suppose. I will now make out a time table if I can to get through these odious days.

Poor Mdlle Lenglen, finding herself beaten by Mrs Mallory flung down her racquet & burst into tears. Her vanity I suppose is colossal. I daresay she thought that to be Mdlle Lenglen was the greatest thing in the world: invincible, like Napoleon. Armstrong, playing in the test match, took up his position against the gates, & would not move, let the bowlers appoint themselves, the whole game became farcical, because there was not time to play it out. But Achilles Ajax, in the Greek play, was of the same temper.—which we all agree to call heroic in him. But then everything is forgiven to the Greeks. And I’ve not read a line of Greek since last year, this time, too; But I shall come back, if its only in snobbery; I shall be reading Greek when I’m old; old as the woman at the cottage door, whose hair might be a wig in a play, its so white, so thick. Seldom penetrated by love for mankind as I am, I sometimes feel sorry for the poor who dont read Shakespeare, & indeed have felt some generous democratic humbug at the Old Vic, when they played Othello & all the poor men & women & children had him then for themselves. Such splendour, & such poverty. I am writing down the fidgets, so no matter if I write nonsense. Indeed, any interference with the normal proportions of things makes me uneasy. I know this room too well—this view too well—I am getting it all out of focus, because I cant walk through it."
1921.09.10,"My handwriting is getting detestable. But I have done with fidgets long ago, & sat in the sun at Bishopstone, & at Chalvington, & at Telscombe Cliffs. I recovered, & we took to seeing houses—without the least success, except that the rides to & from were successful. My only grievance is that one runs off the edge of the lovely into hideousness too soon. Newhaven is spot & rash & pimple & blister; with the incessant motor cars like active lice. Much more important (to me) than anything else, was my recovery of the pen; & thus the hidden stream was given exit, & I felt reborn. I started an article upon the obscure, & should have finished it today, according to calculations, had not Lytton come; & it is impossible to write, unless the brain is unstirred completely by anything save the usual routine. However I gained by the exchange. We talked & talked; & always dislodged some new nugget, the deeper we went. Of course, his friendships are now, as mine are, fearfully important to him—all the more, as I daresay I have said, because he has been offered all the thin shining substitutes which his fame procures—ladies & lords without stint. But what did we talk about? (oddly enough I could write more freely after tea: this is the colourless morning hour, the mist driving across the flats, & rain come at last on the sudden wind.) First we skirmish round with trivialities; next we ascertain how we stand; we recognise that our position is sound; then begin on our writing; then on books—but its all easy enough, & interspaced. He is going to write a play, “I am going to meet my Waterloo”—that is to say he is going to have a shot at the creative. If that fails, he dooms himself to history for ever—perhaps a history of English literature. Writing is an agony, we both agreed. Yet we live by it. We attach ourselves to the breath of life by our pens. The exciting illusion begins. Clive says we pour out brandy & so make romance, which does not exist. Clive came suddenly into view yesterday, in white flannel trousers, & open flannel shirt. He seemed bursting through; & his neck a series of rings of fat, like the Chess Queen’s body. A dowager would hide this with a dog collar. And the heat had sopped his hair, so that he looked debauched & rubbed by dissipation. He was obviously nervous, & instead of boasting of his triumphs, as he did a few months back, almost deprecated them. “Did Lytton think the great world dull? Was he going to give it up? Well, perhaps it is too dull—One should live in the country & work” I’m glad to say that the repentant mood gave out; & up bubbled his natural man. The New Republic—America—money—&c &c &c—

I see that I shirk giving an account of Lytton’s talk—for one thing, I dont like the appearance of writing what will interest Mr Gosse or Mrs Asquith in 50 years’ time. Then, it needs a screw of the brain. I ought to note, though, for my good, that I must get out of the way of minding what people say of my writing. I am noted for it. It breeds discomfort. For instance, when Lytton was telling me of Max [Beerbohm]’s tastes in literature, he thought it necessary to explain that Max had not read me—which was uncomfortable. My dislikes of M.H. is attributed to her low opinion of my writing. So I must give up drawing attention to ‘my writing’. One slips into the way of it; & a little slip is magnified soon. But that was the one awkward moment. In the old days there would have been a thousand."
1921.09.12,"It is true that we are alone again, but I cannot take up my pen, partly, I think, from superstition. I said goodbye to James & Alix at 9 this morning: therefore the whole day is contaminated. Freud has certainly brought out the lines in Alix. Even physically, her bones are more prominent. Only her eyes are curiously vague. She has purpose & security; but this may well be marriage. James remains precisely where he was—the only human being, Alix says, fit for the contemplative life, which is the highest. To look on comprehendingly is, she says, better than to create. But James claims no such eminence. He is the least ambitious of men—not ambitious even of being a character—low, muted, gentle, modest. I suspect that his points show in the shade—which Alix certainly provides. I can fancy him very considerate—selfish, of course, but not blind-selfish, not at all possessive, masculine, or dominating. The worst of it, as I should feel, is the greyness; nothing is worth doing; & his mind is capable enough to make out a case for anything, or against. I daresay his monotony is partly due to us. I fancy that in private he may be as gay as a small boy; perhaps they have a private language. Perhaps they go for treats. Perhaps he is the easiest & gayest of companions. Here he leapt on to my bed, directly I left it, & lay reading Jane’s pamphlet. There’s Noel, too, in the background. Noel, for James, as for Adrian, the unattainable romance, though she has married Jones or Richards, & is romantic no more. I caught Alix in profile & saw her old, masterly, advanced; always in the same coat & skirt, which indeed renews itself as if it were her natural covering.

Lytton, by the way, talked about s——y; & agreed that the b’s are all namby pambies & sentimentalists. He is himself, he said. To be a b. one must be un-virile, unpossessive, very nice indeed, but tending to be sentimental. And then their tastes become so degraded.

I have finished the Wings of the Dove, & make this comment. His [Henry James’s] manipulations become so elaborate towards the end that instead of feeling the artist you merely feel the man who is posing the subject. And then I think he loses the power to feel the crisis. He becomes merely excessively ingenious. This, you seem to hear him saying, is the way to do it. Now just when you expect a crisis, the true artist evades it. Never do the thing, & it will be all the more impressive. Finally, after all this juggling & arranging of silk pocket handkerchiefs, one ceases to have any feeling for the figure behind. Milly thus manipulated, disappears. He overreaches himself. And then one can never read it again. The mental grasp & stret⁠[c]⁠h are magnificent. Not a flabby or slack sentence, but much emasculated by this timidity or consciousness or whatever it is. Very highly American, I conjecture, in the determination to be highly bred, & the slight obtuseness as to what high breeding is.

Sept 12. 21. Charleston

My dear Virginia,

I should be sorry if Jack Squire were to suppose that he had seriously put me out; also, I can’t swear to the phrase “put them right”, though I’m sure it was nothing less impertinent; & so I hope you will say nothing about it. You don’t guess how much I enjoyed my outing to Monks, or how much I like the society of you & your husband. You have created an atmosphere different from, perhaps better than, any I know. It seems odd, considering that we all started much alike in many ways; but I suppose, as they get older, people who start at all peculiar get more & more distinct. Anyhow, what I want to say is that the pleasure of seeing you both besides being great is particular. I am half tempted to suggest some sort of reunion either here or on the downs (weather permitting) for Friday—my birthday—only Mary will be with us and, owing to some absurd misunderstanding, she, I gather, is in your black books. So perhaps we had better wait till the following week.

Yrs

Clive.

P.S. On the ballet Murry is ignorant & silly."
1921.09.14,"Now there’s a chapter in a novel! First: I suspect that Jack Squire rejected the article: then I suspect that Clive, with one of his violent, lovable, revulsions—& yet he’s a snob too—has turned against Coalbox, Jacks, & Lavatory, & wishes to secure his place in intellectual society; & finally, partly from the same reasons, he is determined to contrive so that Mary is on visiting terms with us. The little man is all a bubble, all a muddle; & I could have foretold the whole thing, which has been brewing, I believe, ever since I refused to be one of the ladies at his tea party; & Leonard’s abilities have become known; his star is in the ascendant; & when a star ascends, sure enough Clive will be frantically rushing after. But I say much of this is praiseworthy. Leonard demurs. He is one of those dogs that cringe, he thinks. Anyhow, to continue my comment on the text, its plain that Mary & I are to be coupled together. No gentle gliding apart into mists. Yet why? I reply that I will see her & settle what the quarrel is about if she likes; since I have heard many versions.

There was a very great storm 3 nights ago—on Sunday 11th Sept. to be exact. I had to light my candle for support. Next morning our plum tree was down, & a great tree snapped some feet from the ground in the churchyard. Several graves are under leaf; & a wreath of immortelles lies under glass undamaged. The cottagers have been busy snatching up the twigs; the larger branches belonging, perhaps, to the Rector. More rain fell that night than in the 3 previous months, yet L. is not satisfied. Our garden is a perfect variegated chinz: asters, plumasters, zinnias, geums, nasturtiums & so on: all bright, cut from coloured paper, stiff, upstanding as flowers should be. I have been planting wallflowers for next June."
1921.09.15,"It is the loveliest of evenings—still; the smoke going up straight in the quarry; the white horse & strawberry coloured horse feeding close together; the women coming out of their cottages for no reason, & standing looking; or knitting; the cock pecking in the midst of his hens in the meadow; starlings in the two trees; Asheham fields shorn to the colour of white corduroy; Leonard storing apples above my head. & the sun coming through a pearly glass shade; so that the apples which still hang are palish red & green; the church tower a silver extinguisher rising through the trees. Will this recall anything? I am so anxious to keep every scrap, you see.

I have been dabbling in K.M.’s stories, & have to rinse my mind—in Dryden? Still, if she were not so clever she couldn’t be so disagreeable.

A letter from Morgan this morning. He seems as critical of the East as of Bloomsbury, & sits dressed in a turban watching his Prince dance, quite unimpressed. He is not impressed by Q.Vict. either. Flimsy, he says, compared with Macaulay, which was perhaps what I meant.

There is one woman of genius among the cows. She has decided to leave the herd & eat the branches on the fallen tree. She has now one disciple. The rest utterly condemn. She is a Roger Fry. I heard from Roger the other day, all in a hubblebubble about Murry’s sneering pin-pricking article. He is so angry that he can talk of nothing else, (the cow has 2 disciples). We must go on doing what we like in the desert Roger says, & let Murry climb the heights, as he certainly will.

The birds are moving about like nets full of fish; they turn sideways & vanish; sideways again, & become full of black spots."
1921.09.19,"Miss Green has been for the week end, & a more comfortable guest does not exist. One need not bother about her; yet, at meal times, she proves brisk & fresh. Her father was a professor, or teacher, of geology at Oxford. Her mother a Unitarian, & a liberal, with a great admiration for Gladstone. When Minna was 9 her father died. She has been secretary to Lady St. Davids.

“I consider you as my child” said Ly St D, & underpaid her. Then to Beerbohm Tree for 3 weeks. He walked about the room, behaved like Malvolio, & discoursed to an invisible audience about life. Minna found this trying, especially as it took place late at night in the dome of His Majesties. He used to say “Am I to give this autograph?”—Then she was with Heinemann. But his lack of courage annoyed her; he was afraid to publish Norman Angell; &, not having a penny in the world, Minna was too good a pacifist to stay—So she went on to the U.D.C. In this way she has lived all over England; & is fearfully independent—marches about, protected by her extreme plainness, unmolested, & unnoticed; yet has a strong will of her own; & observes, & won’t be put upon. She is one of that regiment of the wage earning women’s republic. She eats up everything on her plate, very thoroughly; does not keep accounts; spends nothing on dress, & I daresay subscribes to the Russian Famine Fund. Now she is off to spend a fortnight in Germany—a country which she thinks very beautiful. I said there were too many signposts & plaster statues. She would have none of it. But then her thick legs, laced boots, wooden face, flaxen hair (scanty) & red cheeks, would be respectable there; ludicrous in Italy or France."
1921.09.28,"Eliot’s visit passed off successfully, & yet I am disappointed to find that I am no longer afraid of him—"
1921.11.02,"This was the very last thing I wrote at Rodmell—so I suppose. And today is the 2nd of November; Wednesday to be exact; 10 to 7; & Dorothea just left the house for five years & a half. But I like old Kate; who cant see, & picks up butter in mistake for bread. Dorothea surely is a survival from the glacial period. I felt her great nose sawing up and down; she has very powerful mandibles; & little pig eyes. Very soon we should have got across each other. I felt come over me the old aversion. She persists; prods; brutally tramples; & speaks with a kind of measured sweetness, such as people use in boarding houses to servants. Well we had no time to fight; since they took 2 hours to come; & had to catch a train. She salaamed to me. She said that the fruit of her Indian stay might be another book. She said “My book had a very long review in the Times.” “Oh? I said. I never knew you’d written a book.” “It was a very stupid review” she began with furious egotism, gnashing her teeth; & began eagerly to quote. So our minutes passed.

But I ought to run over the 5 weeks or so left out; & really cannot; for I have seen so many people of sorts; & so much has happened; though we are where we are. A printing machine is waiting at Richmond Station, & will be delivered at 8 a.m. tomorrow. Ralph is putting his back to the wheel, a very solid obdurate back. Some of our luncheons have been stormy, or rather silent, with sudden raps of opposition from the third party. My belief is that he has to dig his feet in vigorously in order to make any impression against L.’s superior mobility. But we have got along so far; & yielded, not reluctantly, about Tchekhov’s letters. In two days time—during the week end at any rate—I hope to finish Jacob. I have asked for books from the Times to compell myself to break off. And one of these days I must read it. We go to Rodmell on Friday. I see I can think of nothing worth saying. It has been a November day: soft, dark, as wet as the tropics, with a great funeral (Dr Gardiner’s) passing the window—

Clive hopes to see more of me. He sups with Gandarilla; & Betsy Bibesco wishes me to review her book."
1921.11.15,"Really, really—this is disgraceful—15 days of November spent & my diary none the wiser. But when nothing is written one may safely suppose that I have been stitching books; or we have had tea at 4 & I have taken my walk afterwards; or I have had to read something for next days writing, or I have been out late, & come home with stencilling materials, & sat down in excitement to try one. We went to Rodmell, & the gale blew at us all day; off arctic fields; so we spent our time attending to the fire. The day before this I wrote the last words of Jacob—on Friday Nov. 4th to be precise, having begun it on April 16 1920: allowing for 6 months interval due to Monday or Tuesday & illness, this makes about a year. I have not yet looked at it. I am struggling with Henry James’ ghost stories for The Times; have I not just laid them down in a mood of satiety?— Then I must do Hardy; then I want to write a life of Newnes; then I shall have to furbish up Jacob; & one of these days, if only I could find energy to tackle the Paston letters, I must start Reading: directly I’ve started Reading I shall think of another novel, I daresay. So that the only question appears to be—will my fingers stand so much scribbling?

We dined with Clive on Friday. Aldous & Mary & Maynard there. All the time I felt Mary solicitous, even affectionate; & sure enough, as I left she took my hand, said “I don’t like this plan of quarrelling” & asked me to come & see her. So far nothing has happened—for was I to ring her up, or she me—& what’s it all about?

Molly came to tea. Lilian came to lunch. Poor Lilian—poor Margaret. They sit beside the corpse of the Women’s Guild; the blinds are drawn; they are sad & white, brave, tearless, but infinitely mournful. I see what has happened. When one leaves a life work at 60, one dies. Death, at least, must seem to be there, visible, expectant. One ought to work—never to take one’s eyes from one’s work; & then if death should interrupt, well, it is merely that one must get up & leave one’s stitching—one won’t have wasted a thought on death. Margaret says in her work one gets superannuated. One must give it up. A very cruel work then; & she is left without husband or child. So we dragged Lilian over Richmond; but she saw nothing but the ground. Very unhappy she said she was. And Janet wants to sell her odious house & move to the New Forest. I can’t say that elderly group has met with the fate it deserves.

Molly was dressed in Mrs Freshfield’s velvets. A skirt is enough for an ordinary dress I daresay. “Have we quarrelled with Desmond?” we asked. Dear dear no. We seem to him cranky & crusty? Oh nonsense. Oh well thats all right then—Desmond is merely lazy. He is very uncommunicative just now. He tells me nothing. You have heard about the Waterlows? Sydney has become quite intolerable. He plants red flowers & they come up blue. She can do nothing nothing right. He grumbles all the week end. So at last she forbade him to come down. But he couldn’t stand another Alice walking out of the house. They have been abroad for 6 weeks. She broke down & told me the whole thing. We must just go on disliking each other as other couples do, she said."
1921.11.16,"Can I make out the Waterlow’s tragedy from this telegraphic scrap? I see I scribbled too quick to put in the quotation marks. Anyhow this was what Molly said the other day, & as I have a collection of Sydneyana I add this. I ought to be about to set off to the Wigmore Hall to hear Bach: & nature has intervened; & I am, with my usual economy, asking myself how I can get the utmost possible pleasure out of my evening, which I spend alone, since L. is dining with the Webbs, to meet Fabians. Shall I read King Lear? Do I want such a strain on the emotions? I think I do. It is pouring; but we say Thank God it is warmer. It has been freezing for a week. We go to bed under red blankets, quilts, fur coats; & I cant get up till I hear the quarter struck. But now, as I say, it is raining. I take in the Westminster Gazette. For some politics are beginning to interest me, as I suppose they interest City men—like a football match. One might become a virulent Socialist—or a Conservative? It is a game. I mean by that that I don’t think of ends (nor does any one else) but of means. The American offer about the Navy has set me off on this. I get no letters nowadays, so I read my paper. Clive’s poems have gone today to the Reviewers; our publishing day being December the 1st. Did I describe the advent of the Press? Nelly panic struck, thinking it would come through the kitchen floor. How do you invent these fears? I asked her. Indeed, if she were as ingenious in her cooking we should do well. “Don’t go & take the wire off the larder windows, for goodness sake” she said, “or we shall be having robbers.”

But never have we been so peaceful domestically for so long.

What other news is there? I have left out everyone for a month—everything. How Lady Cromer came to tea, in a charwoman’s bonnet, & cut great chunks of bread for herself. “My dear Virginia, when one is old one sees how absurd it is to think that sort of thing—I know my nieces accuse me of it—& I never give it a thought.” This was when I told her how Kitty [Maxse] was worldly, & wished me to marry into South Kensington. She spoke with that old mellow worldly benignancy, as if all her thoughts were easy & shabby & loose, which I find so charming. In my house I like her better than in hers. She is trying to keep her son not a snob: “but he’ll get among those kinds of people” she said. The Barings were horrified when she sent him to Winchester. “You send a boy to school in order to make friends” they said “The right sort”."
1921.11.25,"L.’s 41st birthday; & he has just caught a mouse in his hands. My apology for not writing is quite truthfully, the Hogarth Press. Roger’s woodcuts, 150 copies, have been gulped down in 2 days. I have just finished stitching the last copies—all but six. L. has been dismissed & taken on in another capacity by the same post; & now, this afternoon, he has been sketching a plan to Green, who is stranded, by which she may become our secretary. The Hogarth Press, you see, begins to outgrow its parents.

Last week end we spent at Tidmarsh. We must have talked our 12 hours, I suppose—& I remember so little: for with old, worn, creased, shabby, intimate friends, it runs so easily; no rapids, or waterfalls; room for everything; & no damned brilliance. We laughed over the letter of the mad negress, I remember. And it was all very warm & the details—such as cups & plates—were exquisite. Carrington & Ralph have a gigantic 4 poster bed. The geese shriek in the early morning. You see, I can’t remember a thing—except that I was warm & communicative. Monday, though, I had a headache. I thought how foolish I had been to ask Richmond for books: & now I have 4 articles to write, & my brain is recovered, & I feel able to polish them all off, rather slap dash. But I wake in the night & think that I haven’t written Hardy; & I shall open my paper & find him dead—So we go on.

Last night Saxon dined here, & behold, here is a postcard, “Mr & Mrs Patteson in 1831” which tells me a good deal. They were drowned. & Lord Houghton wrote a poem about em, & Saxon thought they were Prinseps; & this came of talking about the river Wye, & Barbara, & Sweden & the Finns, & Sydney & Desmond, & how no one will be read 100 years hence save Shaw; which Ralph said to me at tea today, you dont quite like. This is an unwonted subtlety on his part; though hs is apt to be more subtle when he’s severe. He was 27 yesterday."
1921.11.26,"Kot just gone after hearing Leonard his Russian; & so I have an odd half hour to fill up, & reach for this book. I have been cross examining Kot upon the quarrel between Dostoevsky & Turgenev, & find him stuffed with facts, & of course passionate severe & uncompromising. For once in a way I shall have some truth to put in my article. We have spent the day mostly indoors, labelling Roger this afternoon. A yellow, prickly kind of day, with the quiet which comes of fog, & is accentuated, as it happens, by the road being up. It is said that we are to have wood pavement. Today we raised the servants wages by £2 each; & Nelly, for a joke pretended that we had raised her & not Lottie, & I believe this has taken away Lottie’s pleasure. I believe she suspects that we perhaps meant this, or preferred Nelly. At any rate, we have had no thanks.

As for Mary I am playing a fine diplomatic game. I have no time—7.30 draws near—to detail the stages. But I aim at not seeing her; at being friendly; for ever planning to meet; & never never never coming to grips. As if to emphasise this, my nib here dropped into the pot & is clogged with black ink. I can’t help suspecting that this is her game too. What could we say to each other alone?"
1921.12.03,"The diplomatic game is being played with considerable finesse, & I fancy I shan’t meet Mary face to face (which comes, I think from Crossing the Bar) at all. I shan’t cross that bar. Oddly enough, I feel sceptical & disillusioned about Clive and his doings. I’ve said so often enough out of spite; but this seems normal & true. His poor old brain has run down; as at 40 it very well may, if you drink too many cocktails, & sit too long with pretty Mrs Jowett. “Can it be Mr Jowett’s fault, Madame?” said Gravé to me the other night. But I can pass no judgment upon the potency of Mr Jowett.

I dined with the Sangers last night, & enjoyed society. I wore my new black dress, & looked, I daresay, rather nice. That’s a feeling I very seldom have; & I rather intend to enjoy it oftener. I like clothes, if I can design them. So Bertie Russell was attentive, & we struck out like swimmers who knew their waters. One is old enough to cut the trimmings & get to the point. Bertie is a fervid egoist—which helps matters. And then, what a pleasure—this mind on springs. I got as much out of him as I could carry.

“For I should soon be out of my depth” I said. I mean, I said, “all this” & I waved my hand round the room, where by this time were assembled Mr & Miss Amos, Rosalind Toynbee, a German, & Mrs Lucas— “All this is mush; & you can put a telescope to your eye & see through it.”

“If you had my brain you would find the world a very thin, colourless place” he said

But my colours are so foolish I replied.

You want them for your writing, he said. Do you never see things impersonally?

Yes. I see literature like that; Milton, that is.

The Choruses in Samson are pure art, he said.

But I have a feeling that human affairs are impure.

God does mathematics. That’s my feeling. It is the most exalted form of art.

Art? I said.

Well theres style in mathematics as there is in writing, he said. I get the keenest aesthetic pleasure from reading well written mathematics. Lord Kelvin’s style was abominable. My brain is not what it was. I’m past my best—& therefore, of course, I am now celebrated. In Japan they treated me like Charlie Chaplin—disgusting. I shall write no more mathematics. Perhaps I shall write philosophy. The brain becomes rigid at 50—& I shall be 50 in a month or two. I have to make money.

Surely money is settled upon Russells by the country, I said.

I gave mine away years ago, to help promising young men who wanted to write poetry. From 28 to 38 I lived in a cellar & worked. Then my passions got hold of me. Now I have come to terms with my self: I am no longer surprised at what happens. I don’t expect any more emotional experiences. I don’t think any longer that something is going to happen when I meet a new person.

I said that I disagreed with much of this. Yet perhaps I did not expect very much to happen from talking to Bertie. I felt that he had talked to so many people. Thus I did not ask him to come here—I enjoyed it though a good deal; & got home & drank cocoa in the kitchen; & at 7.30 this morning traced a smell of shag in the house & found L. smoking his pipe by the kitchen fire, having come back safe. There was no meeting at Newcastle; a very small one at Manchester; rather more at Durham; but it was an absurd effort for such results, & L. has spoken to Miss Green to that effect severely."
1921.12.11,"Yes, I ought to be doing the beds; but Leonard insists upon doing them himself. Perhaps that’s Lottie on the stairs? Ought I to go out & scold her for not staying in bed? Is the hot water on? Well, soon it will be time to go out & eat a plate of meat in the restaurant in the passage. In other words, both the servants have German measles, & for 3 days we have been servants instead of masters.

Excuse this scrawl therefore;—surely that is Lottie washing up?

Well, what news can I get in?

We went to Heartbreak House with the P⁠[artridge]⁠s. & Lytton. Lytton had just bought a manuscript by Mde du Deffand. Lytton is ripe like a peach in the sun. Carrington wears his old overcoat cut down. Partridge laughs at the wrong jokes.

There was John & Mrs John slightly gross & elderly: wine making his lines thick; & her face more substantial.

Kot dined here. Why did I go to bed with the gooseflesh after hearing discourse of Sullivan Gertler & Sydney Waterlow? They have grease in their texture. And they despise women. And now & then Kot talks like a man of the underworld. No—I cannot make anything of this, what with one thing & another.

I mark that for perhaps the 50th time, I am frustrated as I mean to write poor T. Hardy. I pray that he sits safe & sound by his fireside at this moment. May all bicycles, bronchitises, & influenzas keep far from him."
1921.12.18,"Here it is practically the end of the year, & more pages left blank than seems to me altogether wholesome. But my diary dwindles, perversely enough, when the stuff for it is most abundant. There was Roger here for tea & dinner yesterday; the day before I had to go plundering the shops for presents after tea (we have tea at 4 now to suit Ralph). The day before, Thursday, I had to put in semicolons to my Hen James article while talking to Ralph over my shoulder & then to rush to catch a train to Hampstead to dine with Brett & Gertler. Tomorrow we dine with Adrian. But in thus accumulating facts I am shirking my business of describing them. Well, Brett’s salon need give no one the gooseflesh. I thought to myself, as I sat in my black dress by the anthracite stove in the studio that if Sydney, Kot, Gerder, Brett, Miln, & Sullivan with one voice denounced me, I should sleep the sounder. It is a group without teeth or claws. For one thing they have no faith in each other. In my day groups were formidable because they coalesced. But there was Gertler dismissing Sydney as an old bore (not to his face) & Kot detecting faults, “yes very serious faults—no you misunderstand my character—I do not find fault with the people I really like—I never discuss them—” & Miln is a moonfaced cipher—what they call, justly, a quiet man—& Sullivan is too much of the indiarubber faced, mobile lipped, unshaven, uncombed, black, uncompromising, suspicious, powerful man of genius in Hampstead type for my taste. Anyhow, the hours wore rather thin, & Gertler was the chief stimulant. He has grown fat; his hair stands upright; he has the same tightly buttoned face as of old—little eyes—hard cheeks—something small & concentrated about him which makes me repeat, however foolhardily, that I don’t believe he can paint a picture—though his pertinacity would bore holes in granite, if that helped. However to balance this, I must add that he’s more spontaneous than most: has an alert mind, & is, I should say, in defiance of Ralph, something of a Puritan. Sydney shocks him. Sydney says “Now what do you do about women’s society? Do you copulate with your models?” And again, “Did you think that Marg made a bloody fool of herself the other night?”

Brett is soft, docile, & small. She danced before Q. Victoria.

Roger’s visit went off specially well. I mean we are grown rather intimate, & sit talking at our ease—practically of everything. This was not so a year ago. It is partly the good effect of having friends in common—not, as used to be the way, my seeing Roger alone, while Leonard stayed at home. I see in this one of the good effects of middle age. Roger had Benda in his pocket & read a passage aloud which started us off, & Leonard made him stand to his guns; & then on to all the usual things. Roger grudges every minute now that he doesn’t paint. So we reflected upon these strange, on the whole merciful, dispensations, by which Roger always sees masterpieces ahead of him & I see great novels—We have our atmosphere of illusion, without which life would be so much duller than it is. Here am I at last starting on Hardy, & saying to myself, not for the first time, This at least is going to be first rate. We discussed Proust, & Clive &, since I like to trace these things, I was interested to see how far apart Roger & Clive are now compared with what they were—Roger suspects Clive’s friendships: had not yet been to see him.

And before this Rosalind & Arnold T⁠[oynbee]. appeared with a kitten & the manuscript of her new novel. She is a wisp of a woman, with the eyes of a kind sensitive thoughtful nature, which can’t, I am afraid, produce much in the way of art. She can’t by any possibility write a long book, she said; & she only made £10 by her last; & altogether she seems rather shelless & defenceless, though she is Gilbert Murray’s daughter. I’m glad at least I’m not that, with a dash of aristocracy to refine still further.

Our luck seems, at last, to be in again. At least these are all good signs. Allison is tired of farming: the Americans want to have L.’s Contemporary articles; 37 copies of Tchekov were ordered yesterday; & the Labour Monthly wants L. to write another article. If each of these letters had been written the other way round we should have been very dismal, so we ought to be very cheerful. With luck we may have £400 instead of £250; & we might buy a motor car; & we might buy the meadow; & we might run up another lodge, & we might take in a new strip of garden. & so on & so on."
1921.12.19,"I will add a postscript, as I wait for my parcels to be wrapped up, on the nature of reviewing.

“Mrs Woolf? I want to ask you one or two questions about your Henry James article—”

First (only about the right name of one of the stories.) And now you use the word ‘lewd’. Of course, I dont wish you to change it, but surely that is rather a strong expression to apply to anything by Henry James. I haven’t read the story lately of course—but still my impression is—

Well, I thought that when I read it: one has to go by one’s impressions at the time.

But you know the usual meaning of the word? It is—ah—dirty—Now poor dear old Henry James—At anyrate, think it over, & ring me up in 20 minutes.

So I thought it over & came to the required conclusion in twelve minutes & a half.

But what is one to do about it? He [Bruce Richmond] made it sufficiently clear not only that he wouldn’t stand ‘lewd’, but that he didn’t much like anything else. I feel that this becomes more often the case, & I wonder whether to break off, with an explanation, or to pander, or to go on writing against the current. This last is probably right, but somehow the consciousness of doing that cramps one. One writes stiffly, without spontaneity. Anyhow, for the present I shall let it be, & meet my castigation with resignation. People will complain I’m sure; & poor Bruce fondling his paper like an only child dreads public criticism, & is stern with me, not so much for disrespect to poor old Henry, but for bringing blame on the Supplement.

And how much time I have wasted!

We dined with Adrian & there was Hope; & we sat in the high draughty cold room with all the empty spaces, shouting at each other—till I felt the light in my eyes, in my brain—all of me exposed & desolate. These deaf women make society impossible. It is like shouting in a high wind on the Brighton parade.

We had been buying presents, & sitting in the Club wedged between Kot & Bob. Kot persisting, enforcing, emphasising, analysing, rubbing in—how we are to publish Russian books—how L. is to give up the Contemporary—no, you misunderstand me—I did not say I consider your life to be worthless—Bob on the other side unusually calm & even sensitive. He is having his arteries manipulated in order to finish his play. He groaned sadly that he could not write. Desmond tells him that he is not dramatic. What with the Duchess & Desmond he has come to a full stop: & said that he felt an old fogey, & he said this simply & I felt sorry for him; still, he seems to believe in his arteries, & once they start flowing, he will take us all by surprise—Nor do I, at least, insist upon more plays.

To add to Leonard’s trophies, the Webbs have asked him to edit a book; the League of Nations Union offer to reprint Inl. Government; & the Village in the Jungle is sold among other rare first editions at 6/-. All very good."
1922.01.03,"It is a good resolution that sends me to this page so early—only came back from Rodmell last night—but it is parsimony—a gloomy forecast that makes me use the odd leaves at the end of poor dear Jacob. Blank leaves grow at the end of my diaries.

Home, as I say, last night, after 10 or 11 days at Monks House—days when the wind blew from every quarter at the top of its voice, & great spurts of rain came with it, & hail spat in our fire, & the lawn was strewn with little branches, & there were fiery sunsets over the downs, & one evening of the curled feathers that are so intense that one’s eyes see nothing for 10 seconds afterwards. Mr Shanks had the double pneumonia, & was prayed for in Church, as indeed I thought advisable when I saw Dr Vallance’s face at the window. We drank tea at the Rectory, & I was knocked over by the blast of crude emotion which that festival always releases. In the morning I wrote with steady stoicism my posthumous article upon Hardy. No more reviewing for me, now that Richmond re-writes my sentences to suit the mealy mouths of Belgravia (an exaggeration, I admit) & it is odd how stiffly one sets pen to paper when one is uncertain of editorial approval. That—my dependence upon Printing House Square—is the true reason why I give up; joined with the economic reason that I make as much by other means. Leonard planted, pruned, sprayed, though the cold & the wet & the wildness made his behaviour a heroism to be admired, not comprehended. And last night, on top of our arrival, came to dinner Peter & Topsy. Her face is unnaturally elongated. It looks as if it had been caught in a door as a child. Why, we asked, did he marry her?—but we did not ask it quite so amazedly as his brothers do. He is a romantic: an innocent; a resolute boy; & she, I suppose, had a deeper experience of life, & somehow vouched for all sorts of things which, with this innocence & scholar’s unworldliness, he was ready to take on trust. Fundamentally I guessed her to be sadder & more strained than he is; but also much less disinterested & sincere. So the evening passed; & I vacillated between liking & disliking, feeling pretty sure that I should never take to her warmly, but welcoming the spruce shining mind. With Peter one might be intimate, save that he is so young, so fresh: & not, after all, a born writer. We talked about Fredegond’s religious mania; about Cambridge; youth; our set; theirs; the past; Romer Wilson (whom I denounced, & won some agreement) & finally the Greeks & the Romans, upon which Lucas, who can answer straight off any such question & becomes definite & exact in his replies, instead of merely gentle & modest, said they must return to Blackheath. In the hall Topsy (May I call you Topsy? I asked in the hall) explained why they must return to Blackheath too volubly for my taste. But there’s 6 o’clock striking, & its my evening with the Pastons. Tonight my reading begins."
1922.01.22,"‘Tonight my reading begins’ did I say? And two nights later I was shivering over the fire & had to tumble into bed with the influenza. How describe the fortnights lapse? Happily, it has been a mitigated lapse—not complete like the summer’s. Again I have a gallery of little bright portraits hanging against the wall of my mind—Nessa—Bobo [Mayor]—Bob—Kot—Pippa—to be exact; Nessa just back from France, alighting for a fortnight, & then off again, leaving the children, who have meanwhile got influenza, to Paris. But what am I to say about her? All very gay in French boots, hat, & check skirt; with that queer antique simplicity of surface which I compare to the marble cheeks of a Greek statue. I mean her attitude to Clive.

“Its a great pity” she said. “Mary is a stupid little woman. There she was at the station to meet us. They’ve settled down together completely. I never thought it possible after the Guano. She’s a very nice woman—quite simple & straightforward.”

“Its ruining him” I said. “He talks about writing like a fashionable man, now. And if Mary’s there, he’s intolerable.”

“Yes” said Nessa. Her acceptance of all this is complete; perfectly open, unresentful, philosophic.

But can I bind myself to go through my hoops—Bob & Bobo & the rest?

I’d rather try a general “account of my friends” to match one I made two or three years ago.

Suppose I visualise them as a group of marbles with myself in the midst?—& now one drawing near, & then another rolling off into a corner? It’s Desmond that has rolled into the corner this time. I dont know how it came about. Fundamentally, it is chance; that I was ill, & he in Ireland, & then he dines out, & has to be at the office, & so on & so on. Only there are seasons when he breaks through these hindrances persistently, & even has to be warded off (by Leonard that is for I never manage that); whereas, now, for the past 8 months, since the dinner when we hid Miss Green behind a screen, we have never seen him. Eight months—& life consists of how many months? That’s what I begin to say to myself, as I near my 40th birthday. The machinery for seeing friends is too primitive: one should be able to see them by telephone—ring up, & be in the same room. Only there is loneliness to be considered too—this exacting brain—this spirit which wont entirely accommodate itself to company. One person one must have, like air to breathe; but—as for the rest? Still I don’t like missing Desmond; & I blame myself a little for writing sharply in the N.S. (but I was right) about women; & I find myself condemning him for a penny a liner on good terms with his public.

Lytton’s marble is very close. I think he has determined, partly owing to his fame, to stick tight to one or two rocks, & his friends are one of them. So we are asked to Tidmarsh, & meetings are very carefully cherished, when they occur. His flame burns very pure. No masses of superfluity intervene. We have burnt up all that long ago. (Here mercifully I am compelled to stop in order to rule some blue lines. This is still influenza writing, or I’m inhibited by [Dr] Fergusson’s prohibition. No work for 2 or 3 weeks, he says. But I fancy I shall finish Hardy tomorrow.)

And I could only find a black pencil. But the truth is that when one is seeing people often & intimately one cannot say very much about it. I don’t see Lytton far enough away to have a clear view of him.

On the other hand, Sydney has almost vanished into the fog. Yesterday he loomed up again—for the first time since—? He hasn’t been here for 9 months perhaps. He wants to come back. But as during his absence, I have had reports of his infidelity I’m going to hum & haw a little. I doubt that he is faithful or unfaithful. And he lives in the pigsty—by which I mean the Murrys & the Sullivans & the Gertlers.

I’ve no quarrels to record. Now I come to think of it I’m on excellent terms with Clive, with Maynard, with Mary, for anything I know to the contrary. We should get on admirably on a desert island, if Mary could go behind a rock; but London, this January 1922, is not a desert island, & though we meet each other in the street now & again, the conditions don’t make for intimacy. There’s Saxon—at the end of the telephone. Infinitely weary, bored, irritable, even yawning audibly as he spoke, was he last night—grudging other people, so I thought, even their influenzas. What one envies more than anything is simply life. We all live, this way or that: Saxon has never quite got the hang of it—nor Adrian either, I fancy, though Karin obscures Adrian rather effectively. We dined there, perhaps I forgot to record, & bawled like Margate boys.

The Pope is dying today; & the Irishmen have come to terms. The church bells ring, & though it is 10 minutes to eleven I can’t see the face of the clock, nor even the trees in the garden. The birds wake us with their jangling about 7 o’clock; which I take to be a sign of spring, but then I am always optimistic. A thick mist, steam coloured, obscures even twigs, let alone Towers Place. Why do I trouble to be so particular with facts? I think it is my sense of the flight of time: so soon Towers Place will be no more; & twigs, & I that write. I feel time racing like a film at the Cinema. I try to stop it. I prod it with my pen. I try to pin it down."
1922.02.04,"Another fortnight spent in bed. Indeed, almost as I put down my pen I was seized with a second attack, lay in bed like a piece of timber, & am still in bed, sitting up, looking at the fire, the tree twigs hung with drops of aquamarine, & my temperature a shade above normal. I think this second attack was more wearisome than the first, & I have seen very few people. Nessa came again. How painful these meetings are! Let me try to analyse. Perhaps it is that we both feel that we can exist independently of the other. The door shuts between us, & life flows on again & completely removes the trace. That is an absurd exaggeration. The truth is she was a little depressed, ostensibly because no one had mentioned painting to her in the course of three weeks. “I have seen all the cleverest people, she said, & not one asked me about the South of France. Nobody mentioned painting. I hung two of our latest paintings in Maynard’s room, & he never noticed them.”

“Surely Clive?” I said.

“Oh Clive knows nothing whatever about it” she replied. All this tends to make her turn to Paris as her dwelling place. But then there are the children, Julian at school, Quentin coming home nightly. And then there is Duncan. “And after all there is nothing binding in our relationship”, she said. “Its quite different from yours.”

And so this ruffled me: donkey that I am—am susceptible to the faintest chord of dissonance twelve fields away. I set out to prove that being childless I was less normal than she. She took offence (the words are too strong). Told me I shouldn’t enjoy café life in Paris. Told me I liked my own fireside & books & my friends visits; implied that I was settled & unadventurous. Implied that I spent a great deal upon comfort. As we had only 2 hours together, & she left for Paris next morning, & perhaps I shant see her till May, anyhow not continuously, I felt a sort of discontent, as the door closed behind her. My life, I suppose, did not very vigorously rush in.

Indeed, we are at the moment a little tremulous again. What to do about Ralph?—about the Press? Mrs Manning Sanders forges ahead. She has reached the printing off stage, which means that Ralph works in the basement, & leaves the machine dirty. We had tea at 4 yesterday, & I made myself agreeable. “And the type will be dry for me tomorrow?” I said, having dissed wet type laboriously all the afternoon.

“No it is not washed yet” he said. Then vanished.

L. was struggling with the fire. When the door shut I understood—L. was white with rage—that R. had slipped off leaving L. to go down & clean up. If he had apologised, this would have been bad enough; but to slink away, like a shamefaced schoolboy, was outrageous, & I was furious. L. had been at work all day; & now had another hour in the cold.

Upon this crystallised all our grumblings of the past—They are to the effect that he is lazy, undependable, now industrious, now slack, unadventurous, all corroded by Lytton, can’t praise, yet has no view of his own—the old story, which one has heard so often from the victims of the old serpent, but rather a serious detraction from his merits, as a partner in an enterprise. Should the enterprise be modified? Should we part company? Should we hire a woman drudge? I suspect that the work is not possible for an educated & vigorous young man: but I am being charitable."
1922.02.06,"What a sprightly journalist Clive Bell is! I have just read him, & see how my sentences would have to be clipped to march in time with his.

Mrs Manning Sanders is a bob haired, wide mouthed woman, dressed in a velvet dressing gown, plump, sandy-haired with canine brown eyes far apart. We liked her. But to Ralph her Fitzroy St origin was against her—this is his rule of thumb measure—for God knows, he said nothing, & is hard & angular as a block of wood. However, we had Mrs M.S. from 5 to 7.15."
1922.02.14,"So far had I written that Monday when Fergusson came in & pronounced that my eccentric pulse had passed the limits of reason & was in fact insane. So I was laid in bed again, & set up my state in the drawing room, where I now write sitting up in bed, alongside the fire, with a temperature a shade below normal, & a heart become naturally abnormal, so that perhaps I shall be up & creeping this time next week. I am reading Moby Dick: Princesse de Cleves; Lord Salisbury: Old Mortality; Small Talk at Wreyland; with an occasional bite at the Life of Lord Tennyson, of Johnson; & anything else I find handy. But this is all dissipated & invalidish. I can only hope that like dead leaves they may fertilise my brain. Otherwise, what a 12 months it has been for writing!—& I at the prime of life, with little creatures in my head which won’t exist if I dont let them out. K.M. bursts upon the world in glory next week; I have to hold over Jacob’s Room till October; & I somehow fear that by that time it will appear to me sterile acrobatics. Nevertheless, such is life, that I am very tolerably amused; see a good many people, Elena [Richmond], Kot, Adrian, Lytton today; & drowse off comfortably. It is illness at its best. We dine over the fire. L. has his tray on a little stool. We are as comfortable as cottagers (looked at through the window) & this morning dropped from the blue (yes it is blue, & frost on the roofs, & Ralph skating at Tidmarsh; & Mrs Sanders not sent her proofs) £114.18., unexpected payment by Mitchells, in whom I lost, so I thought, £600. This is mercy indeed; for we were very low at the bank, having bought type; & would have had to sell out, for our travels & printers bills. God after all does exist; for always some wind brings down an apple at the critical moment.

Elena has grown solid, like a tree trunk. She keeps her mystery. A performing seal—one doesn’t know what is instinct, what intellect. I find her sympathetic—so maternal, quiet, kindly; & liking literature as a lady does; & saying such unexpected things about it, as a lady does. She doesn’t like representation in fiction; can’t stand Wells & Bennett; attempts Dorothy Richardson; is puzzled; reverts to Scott; hasn’t heard of Joyce; comfortably waves aside indecency; I should guess that she represents the top layer of the Mudie general public very accurately. She is modest, even reserved, about her own doings, which gives her charm. Would have like a country life—dogs, garden, village charities, county committees, Gunby & Stephen Massingberd I suppose, best of all; & hates London, where she has had however her great successes. Like my father, I am attracted by the simple & affectionate & womanly. Not that she now dresses with beauty or has much to boast. She is a handsome du Maurier matron, with a double chin, settled complexion; & she dresses in a pepper & salt tailor made, wears spats, & has something of the American bust. I like chattering to her about literature. On Saturday when she comes again, I shall try to discuss the Lushingtons.

And Adrian is so happy & genial that I am really pleased. I don’t want to make him out a failure even. An unambitious man, with good brains, money, wife & children is, I daresay, the most fortunate of us all. He need not protect himself by any illusions. He sees things as they are. He is humorous, contented; free to enjoy without envy or uneasiness. “Oh well”, he said talking of his medical career, “it’s something to do.” “Its easier now to go on than to stop” he said. He has his ya(t)cht, & as the years pass, he will ripen into a delightful father. Moreover, like the whole family, he has this distinguished, cool, point of view, which always makes him good company, & admits him to any society—if he wished for any society, which needless to say, he doesn’t.

Saxon’s father is dead; & Saxon controls two houses of lunatics, some with broken legs, others with the influenza; which will make a man of him, so all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds.

I did not enjoy Molly [MacCarthy]’s visit. She is so deaf; so wandering; grown as plump as a ptarmigan; inconclusive more than ever; given to sudden vacant pauses, with her head dropped down; yet very affectionate in her flittermouse way; with that charming irresponsible heartlessness, which always amuses me. She wakes from a pause & raps out something quite to the point & even prosaic. She told me how she had loved the Governor of Madras, & refused Desmond for him, & was very glad now she had married Desmond, who suits her exactly she said. Why did I not enjoy Molly’s visit then? Well, she never concentrates upon me, I suppose.

I meant to make some notes of my reading (which should include Peacock by the way) but Lottie’s interminable gossip with the old witch wood woman frets me. Talk—talk—talk—wonder expressed—loud laughter—agreement—wood woman’s voice claps [?] more & more emphatic—Nelly there too—Talk with them a kind of muscular activity I think, for they never say much: repeat one thing over & over.

Goodbye goodbye—don’t forget.

Ah! at last! And now Lottie must compare notes with Nelly downstairs."
1922.02.15,"I thought to myself, as Lytton was talking, Now I will remember this & write it down in my diary tomorrow. And as I thought that, everything melted to mist. People don’t say things, except in biographies. True, Lytton was smooth & mild & melancholy beyond his wont; but with intimates, when talk is interesting, one sentence melts into another; heads & tails merge; there is never a complete beast. These I remember as opinions: Lady Gs. life of Salisbury is extremely good: Salisbury was a perfect aristocrat. The point about him was that he was a man of action simply & solely. Lady S. was stuck up & pert; they discussed travelling second class. And what else can I remember? Absolutely nothing? ‘Latest Racine’ he had read on the posters at Waterloo; thought it referred to Masefield; then re-read Racing. But he was back again in his old pre-Eminent Victorians despondency, partly, I guessed, because the publishers are chilly about his essays; partly because he can’t think of a plot for a play. When I told him a history of George IVth was quite good enough, I think he was pleased. How these writers live in their work—How ambition consumes them! Everything radiates from this in Lytton, & I fancy loneliness leaks in through the chinks. He gave me the first edition of a book by Beckford [not traced]; a very characteristic present, & the first he ever gave me, or I him.

We disagreed violently about Percy Lubbock’s book; & I traced poor dear Ralph’s swift unerring insight to the original source. Its annoying to me—as if Lottie picked up my gold watch & gave it a scouring with Bluebell polish (this utterly inappropriate image comes from the irritation she is just now causing me by scrubbing door plates, & turning on the electric light.) All Lytton’s subtleties & allusions come out spick & span blown through brass.

Of my reading I will now try to make some note.

First Peacock; Nightmare Abbey, & Crotchet Castle. Both are so much better than I remember. Doubtless, Peacock is a taste acquired in maturity. When I was young, reading him in a railway carriage in Greece, sitting opposite Thoby, I remember, who pleased me immensely by approving my remark that Meredith had got his women from Peacock, & that they were very charming women, then, I say I rather had to prod my enthusiasm. Thoby liked it straight off. I wanted mystery, romance, psychology I suppose. And now more than anything I want beautiful prose. I relish it more & more exquisitely. And I enjoy satire more. I like the scepticism of his mind more. I enjoy intellectuality. Moreover, fantasticality does a good deal better than sham psychology. One touch of red in the cheek is all he gives, but I can do the rest. And then they’re so short; & I read them in little yellowish perfectly appropriate first editions.

The masterly Scott has me by the hair once more. Old Mortality. I’m in the middle; & have to put up with some dull sermons; but I doubt that he can be dull, because everything is so much in keeping—even his odd monochromatic landscape painting, done in smooth washes of sepia & burnt siena. Edith & Henry too might be typical figures by an old master, put in exactly in the right place. And Cuddie & Mause are as usual, marching straight away for all time, as lusty as life. But I daresay the fighting & the story telling business prevent him from going quite ahead with his gun as in the Antiquary;"
1922.02.16,"to continue—Certainly the later chapters are bare & grey: ground out too palpably: authorities, I daresay, interfering with the original flow. And Morton is a prig; & Edith a stick; & Evandale a brick; & the preachers dulness I could take for granted. Still—still—I want to know what the next chapter brings, & these gallant old fellows can be excused practically anything.

How far can our historical portrait painters be trusted, seeing the difficulty I have in putting down the face of Violet Dickinson, whom I saw, for 2 hours yesterday afternoon? One hears her talking in a swinging random way to Lottie in the hall, as she comes in. “Where’s my marmalade?—How’s Mrs Woolf? Better eh? Where is she?” meanwhile putting down coat & umbrella & not listening to a word. Then she seemed to me as she came in gigantically tall: tailor made; with a pearl dolphin with red tongue swinging from a black ribbon; rather stouter; with her white face; prominent blue eyes; nose with a chip off the end; & small beautifully aristocratic hands. Very well: but her talk? Since nature herself could give no account of it—since nature has wilfully left out some screw—what chance is there for me? It touches Mr Bevan; bounces off to Wild Dayrell & the nurse who cut out a bit of the curtain, which was found after three hundred years to come from the curtain at Littlecote: Mrs Bevan kept hordes of goats. Mr Bevan has escaped with a Frenchwoman. His taxi—a Daimler car—went from Victoria to the Emporium & back again: away again—then to the aerodrome. Such nonsense putting old Ribblesdale & Horner on Boards—Ly.R. was an Astor & refused to let a penny of hers be invested—Your friend Miss Shreiner has gone to Bankok. Dont you remember all her boots and shoes in Eaton Square? To tell the truth I remembered neither Shreiner, her boots, or Eaton Square. Then Herman Norman is back & says things are in an awful mess at Teheran.

‘He’s my cousin’ I said.

Hows that? Off we went on to Normans. Leonard & Ralph were having tea meanwhile & sometimes intercepted a whiff of grapeshot. Now all this, properly strung together, would make a very amusing sketch in the style of Jane Austen. But old Jane, if she had been in the mood, would have given all the other things—no, I dont think she would; for Jane was not given to general reflections; one cant put in the shadows that appear curving round her, & giving her a sort of beauty. She quiets down—though believing the old doctrine that talk must be incessant—& becomes humane, generous; shows that humorous sympathy which brings everything into her scope—naturally; with a touch of salt & reality; she has the range of a good novelist, bathing things in their own atmosphere too, only all so fragmentary & jerky. She told me she had no wish to live. “I’m very happy” she said, Oh yes, very happy—But why should I want to go on living? What is there to live for? Your friends?—My friends are all dead. Ozzie? Oh he’d do just as well without me. I should like to tidy things up & disappear.

But you believe in immortality?

“No: I don’t know that I do—Dust & ashes, I say.”

She laughed of course; & yet, as I say, has somehow the all round imaginative view which makes one believe her. Certainly I like—is love the word for these strange deep ancient affections, which began in youth, & have got mixed up with so many important things? I kept looking at her large pleasant blue eyes, so candid & generous, & hearty & going back to Fritham & Hyde Park Gate.

But this doesn’t make a picture, all the same. I feel her somehow to be the sketch for a woman of genius. All the fluid gifts have gone in; but not the boney ones."
1922.02.17,"I’ve just had my dose of phenacetin—that is to say a mildly unfavourable review of Monday or Tuesday reported by Leonard from the Dial, the more depressing as I had vaguely hoped for approval in that august quarter. It seems as if I succeed nowhere. Yet, I’m glad to find, I have acquired a little philosophy. It amounts to a sense of freedom. I write what I like writing & there’s an end on it. Moreover, heaven knows I get consideration enough.

Molly Hamilton sits for her portrait today. Her portrait, to be sure, was a little shadowed by the fact that, but for her, I should have had Lytton in the chair, & should have got more for my money. She is a crude piece of work by comparison. One of the strugglers; & thus a good deal of time must be wasted upon facts—how she is to get a job—what she can live on &c. Besides, the strugglers are all worn & muscular with struggling. She is bitter against people—seems to me to snap, as a dog does with a thorn in his foot. And something of her pleasure in seeing me is the charwoman’s pleasure in talking of her bad leg: by a grate which she need not polish, & with tea things which she need not wash up. However, to give her her due, she is a warm, courageous, bustling woman; & I like her spirit, & the trophies she brings me of buffeting & rejection—‘real’ life; if one chooses to think it so. Never was anyone more on their own; & I think she means it when she wishes the motor omnibus would swerve in her direction; but cant be bothered to step to meet it. “And then I’m so angry with myself. I have a good howl & start afresh.” I shouldn’t like to come in from the Strand, grudging the omnibus its good guidance, find my fire out, no one there, & perhaps a business letter from a firm or an Editor—something severe & impersonal. A dull man wants to marry her. Why not marry a nice man? I asked. “After being on one’s own for eight years its impossible to marry anyone” she told me. “One gets into the habit of being free to do as one likes.” She had been the guest of Lady Rhondda in the South of France; & Lady R. who is a good able superficial woman, had psychologised her divorce proceedings all the time, which was boring Molly said; & Lady R. is a feminist, & Molly is not. But the lady Rs. ought to be feminists, I said; & you must encourage them, for if the rich women will do it, we neednt; & its the feminists who will drain off this black blood of bitterness which is poisoning us all. So we talked; the fire dying out; all in shadow, which is the best light for women’s nerves once they’re passed 40. I observe that my women guests of that age—Molly & Elena, move to have their backs to the window, on some excuse or other. Old Violet who has passed that stage, faces light composedly.

I meant to write about death, only life came breaking in as usual. I like, I see, to question people about death. I have taken it into my head that I shan’t live till 70. Suppose, I said to myself the other day this pain over my heart suddenly wrung me out like a dish cloth & left me dead?—I was feeling sleepy, indifferent, & calm; & so thought it didn’t much matter, except for L. Then, some bird or light I daresay, or waking wider, set me off wishing to live on my own—wishing chiefly to walk along the river & look at things."
1922.02.18,"Three dozen eggs at present prices work out at 10/6. Three dozen = 36. Four eggs for breakfast work out at 28 a week. This leaves 8 over for cooking. I have an egg now every night for dinner. I make these calculations not with a view to an essay upon national economy, though that comes in. My weekly books—these are in my mind—the very top layer, to be shifted off here most conveniently. For according to the papers, the cost of living is now I dont know how much lower than last year; whereas my books remain about the same. You cant question Nelly much without rubbing a sore. She threatens at once to send up a cheap meal “& Mr Woolf wont like that.” There! Not a very grievous itch; & quelled by the sight of the new Byron letters just come from Mudie’s.

Once more my mind is distracted from the thought of death. There was something about fame I had it in mind to say yesterday—oh I think it was that I have made up my mind that I’m not going to be popular, & so genuinely that I look upon disregard or abuse as part of my bargain. I’m to write what I like; & they’re to say what they like. My only interest as a writer lies, I begin to see, in some queer individuality: not in strength, or passion, or anything startling; but then I say to myself, is not ‘some queer individuality’ precisely the quality I respect? Peacock, for example: Borrow; Donne; Douglas, in Alone, has a touch of it. Who else comes to mind immediately? FitzGerald’s Letters. People with this gift go on sounding long after the melodious vigorous music is banal. In proof of this, I read that a small boy, given a book by Marie Corelli for a Sunday school prize, at once killed himself; & the coroner remarked that one of her books was not what he himself would call “at all a nice book”. So perhaps the Mighty Atom is dwindling away, & Night & Day arising—though the Voyage Out seems at the moment most in esteem. That encourages me. After 7 years next April the Dial speaks of its superb artistry. If they say the same of N. & D. in 7 years I shall be content; but I must wait 14 for anyone to take Monday or Tuesday to heart.

I want to read Byron’s Letters, but I must go on with La Princesse de Cléves. This masterpiece has long been on my conscience. Me to talk of fiction & not to have read this classic! But reading classics is generally hard going. Especially classics like this one, which are classics because of their perfect taste, shapeliness, composure, artistry. Not a hair of its head is dishevelled. I think the beauty very great, but hard to appreciate. All the characters are noble. The movement is stately. The machinery a little cumbrous. Stories have to be told. Letters dropped. It is the action of the human heart & not of muscle or fate that we watch. But stories of noble human hearts have their moments unapproachable in other circumstances. There is a quiet understated profundity in the relations between Madame de Cléves & her mother, for example. If I were reviewing it, I think I should take for my text beauty in character. Thank God though I am not reviewing it. Within the last few minutes I have skimmed the reviews in the New Statesman; between coffee & cigarette I read the Nation: now the best brains in England (metaphorically speaking) sweated themselves for I don’t know how many hours to give me this brief condescending sort of amusement. When I read reviews I crush the columns together to get at one or two sentences; is it a good book or a bad? And then I discount those 2 sentences according to what I know of the book & of the reviewer. But when I write a review I write every sentence as if it were going to be tried before 3 Chief Justices: I cant believe that I am crushed together & discounted. Reviews seem to me more & more frivolous. Criticism on the other hand absorbs me more & more.

But after 6 weeks influenza my mind throws up no matutinal fountains. My note book lies by my bed unopened. At first I could hardly read for the swarm of ideas that rose involuntarily. I had to write them out at once. And this is great fun. A little air, seeing the buses go by, lounging by the river, will, please God, send the sparks flying again. I am suspended between life & death in an unfamiliar way. Where is my paper knife? I must cut Lord Byron."
1922.03.06,"The cat lets this mouse run a few steps once more. I have walked for 10 minutes only, according to the directions of Dr Sainsbury, who after examining me for an hour said—many things; among them that we can’t go abroad. But I am back again, after 2 months this very day, sitting in my chair after tea, writing; & I wrote Jacob this morning, & though my temperature is not normal, my habits are: & that is all I care for. No more lounging & drowsing & doctors visits of a morning, I hope. Yet I no longer feel very trustful. And Ralph may be in any moment to stop these reflections."
1922.03.12,"This book dwindles, now that I draw my stream off in the morning. Were it not for the irritation of suspense—Nelly & Lottie: the hospital; the operation, & my own raging toothache—by which I designate my desire to be writing out the preface to Reading, I should let this page lie blank. Yet many portraits are owed to it—I have seen people—& people. Eliot, Clive, Violet,—if no one else. Of these Eliot amuses me most—grown supple as an eel; yes, grown positively familiar & jocular & friendly, though retaining I hope some shreds of authority. I mustn’t lick all the paint off my Gods. He is starting a magazine; to which 20 people are to contribute; & Leonard & I are among them! So what does it matter if K.M. soars in the newspapers, & runs up sales skyhigh? Ah, I have found a fine way of putting her in her place. The more she is praised, the more I am convinced she is bad. After all, there’s some truth in this. She touches the spot too universally for that spot to be of the bluest blood.

“I’ve ceased even to think about Murry. I’ve forgotten all about him” said Tom.

What, then, did we discuss? He has written a poem of 40 pages, which we are to print in the autumn. This is his best work, he says. He is pleased with it; takes heart, I think, from the thought of that safe in his desk. Clive, via Mary, says he uses violet powder to make him look cadaverous. Thus it appears that Mary is not on good terms with Tom; & that I am seeing Clive rather frequently. He comes on Wednesdays; jolly, & rosy, & squab: a man of the world; & enough of my old friend, & enough of my old lover, to make the afternoons hum. One a week is probably enough. His letters suggest doubts. But, oh dear me, after 9 weeks claustration, I want to vault the wall, & pick a few flowers. The ethical code of Bloomsbury allows poaching; & I’m amused to see how far their ethics are merely theoretic. Moreover, & more seriously, a change of relationship, a middle aged relationship, offers new experiences.

Then I hit Morgan on the wing. He had come to London that very day, & so came here, & was, we thought, depressed to the verge of inanition. To come back to Weybridge, to come back to an ugly house a mile from the station, an old, fussy, exacting mother, to come back having lost your Rajah, without a novel, & with no power to write one—this is dismal, I expect, at the age of 43. The middle age of b——s is not to be contemplated without horror. But he was charming, transparent; & told us as much as we could get out. A years absence fills one too full for many drops to issue upon turning the bottle upside down. He told us about the sparrows that fly about the Palace—No one troubles about them. “I used to shout at them sometimes. One got caught in the electric wire. There it hung, until it wrenched its claw off & flew away. The squirrels sat on the piano. There is a great quarrel between the elder branch & the younger branch. The younger branch came to the festival of the God. He treated me very nicely, & hoped to see more of me. “If I thought they would treat you with decent politeness, I should be only too glad that you should go” the Rajah said. I used to row on the lake which was nice. The Indians were too heavy to row. There were black hills. A very nice climate, but dull. There were sparrows only. In other parts the birds were so lovely—I thought of you Virginia (which pleased me). I dont believe in native states any more. Agitators don’t exist there. If they come, they disappear. It is a very nice life; but one wants other people to talk to. It is much nicer than this. I felt no enthusiasm at seeing my native cliffs again.” That was obvious. Off he went, carrying a very heavy metal plate, to dine with Aunt Rosalie at Putney."
1922.03.24,"I write in order to drown the voice of the canary bird—Leonard’s typewriting I mean. I cannot read it down, but I can write it down. Gravé is imminent. I have nothing special to add as to my circumstances. Still invalided, I sit & receive visitors almost daily; & say nothing about them here. I am writing the first chapter of Reading with the usual fabulous zest. I have never enjoyed any writing more. How often have I said this? Does the pleasure last? I forget—I say I shall write the book in 6 months,—under the year, at any rate. For this reason, people are neglected, & accumulate, up & up & up: I cannot see them now—Nessa, Duncan, Toynbees, Bobo, Goldie, Mason, Roger, Clive, Clive, Clive, Ray. Clive is the most persistent; we talked from 4.30 to 10.15 the other day. It is clear that I am to rub up his wits; & in return I get my manners polished. I hear of supper parties; elicit facts about drink & talk & goings on. Viola Tree starts singing Mozart with a great hole in her stocking: Christabel “a little lump of passion”: Mary—mum; Shearman confiding at 3 a.m. his distaste for life. Off we go—C. & I—upon our relish for it. He enjoys everything—even the old hag in the doorway. There is no truth about life, he says, except what we feel. It is good if you enjoy it, & so forth. Obviously we reach no heights of reason. Nor do we become completely intimate. A little colour is added to taste. We have our embrace; our frill of sentiment. Impossible, as Nessa says, to talk without it. But I perceive, chiefly through his letters, that once a fortnight is the pitch of our relationship.

Nelly & Lottie have talked till the sky seems nothing but a dish cover echoing their changes of mind. They go home for the week end to settle the matter, & eat birthday cakes, & I guess that she won’t go to hospital after all. Refer back to some other scene of the kind if you wish to know how many hours have been wasted; how many reflections upon the lower classes formulated; & how often L. has approached me before I order dinner with a pained, solicitous appearance, begging me on no account to say this or that, strongly advising me at all costs to make something else plain.

Betty Potter loves me; is in despair; & I have to see her rehearse in order to keep her from suicide. How can anyone be such a fool as to believe in anyone?"
1922.03.30,"They have decided for the operation; or rather Johnston has decided for them; & no one can overrule his finding, as he alone had the materials. Now Emma Gilman is in the house, & we have just presented a rose coloured dressing jacket. The atmosphere is a little tremulous, with that kind of significance in trivial sayings which is moving & uncomfortable. It is snowing now, large loose watery flakes; they fall straight; there is no wind: four turned to large drops hang on the branch against the window; (but I am thinking out tomorrow’s writing—or even skipping to the end of the book, & thinking what I shall say about Shaw). Muddy water is in the evening sky, & we began summer time last Sunday, so the evening sky is prolonged. The poor Vaughans will find it very difficult to get through the long evening; & Emma will take a turn in Kensington Gardens, or will say, as she once said to me, “One always expects something of the summer; but somehow, it never seems to happen.” This she said some time in 1908 in Russell Square, one evening.

I am shirking Bobo’s rehearsal, which I meant to describe. Miss Craig is a rosy, ruddy ‘personage’ in white waistcoat, with black bow tie & gold chain loosely knotted.

Stop those monkey tricks, do Saunders—& let us have some light. Miss Craig (Saunders stands right up to the footlights & shouts through her hollowed hands:) “There’s a short on the battens, Miss Craig.”

Lets have the floats then….

Now, all of you. I want you to listen carefully to the music. Make the movements that suggest themselves to you.

Beautiful lady, you go up to the balcony. Can you step to the left? No: I won’t take risks. Young man, Dunlop, you walk straight—straight I say—straight—Can’t you move that table? No? Well then to the right. Miss Potter (this with some acerbity) you needn’t dance.

Poor Betty looked like the skeleton of a sheep. She is at one of her crises, & may be dismissed the stage over this affair.

But it is, as usual, the atmosphere I want to get. The supple, candid, free & easy good sense of theatrical manners, as I noted them at tea. “My dear boy,” drinking out of the same cup. Little Lanchester said, when I asked if she walked in her pyjamas, “Oh do stop being funny”—I dont think one could use one’s brain without being warned off. Still, it don’t much matter. I walked with Miss Litvinne, mother of an illegitimate child, down Longacre, & found her like an articulate terrier—eyes wide apart; greased to life; nimble; sure footed, without a depth anywhere in her brain. They go to the Cabaret; all night dances; John Goss sings. She was communicative, even admiring I think. Anyhow, I like Bohemians. Then we went into the theatre, & there was the light on, the group significant, (Bobo’s children) gold tissue; something stimulating & unreal."
1922.04.27,"Just back—not from the Club, but from Lopokhova & Rodmell, & fingers are so cold I cant close them on my pen. It is blackening for another downpour. This is the worst spring on record. 27 days of bitter wind, blinding rain, gusts, snowstorms, storms every day. So Rodmell was mitigated joy, & to this was added Nelly’s diversion so that we had to carry coals ourselves. She left us after a week, unable to stand the bi-weekly journey to Lottie in hospital.

We saw Mayors, Nessa, & Cecils. Lady G. Cecil is much like a terrier dog in coat & skirt: worried, untidy, insignificant; ardent, masculine in talk; a terrier on a chain; a great lady much snubbed & reduced: where, I wonder, do her lines & cavities come from? The 80ties was her heyday, when she went to Glasgow with Ld Salisbury & there were 10,000 people in the station who cheered like one man—(the Gordon crisis I think). Jimmy & Hugh & I spent all our pocket money & more—Jimmy was in debt for 3 years, getting up an agitation about Gordon—hiring halls & speakers. Where’s that spirit now? The whole of politics is dominated by one personality in whom no one believes. Gladstone was a dishonest man if you like—but he was a great man. He had a policy. This man [Lloyd George] has nothing. Hugh tells me there’s no politics now as there was in our youth. Its a different thing. Your husband says the same. All spites & personalities. Very bad for the country—We faced each other standing still in the woods to deliver these views."
1922.06.11,"Disgraceful! disgraceful! disgraceful!

From the 27th day of April to this, the eleventh of June, not a word has been recorded. And I only write now to excuse myself from copying out a page or two of Jacob for Miss Green. The depression of a return from Rodmell is always acute. Perhaps this continued temperature—I lost 3 teeth in vain the other day—may be some sort of cause for my ups & downs. Yet the 10 days at Rodmell passed smoothly. One lives in the brain there—I slip easily from writing to reading with spaces between of walking—walking through the long grass in the meadows, or up the downs; &—well I need not talk about June. Perfection is such that it becomes like a normal state. Such is ‘weather’; & happiness is not strange but normal too—And so of course, coming back from Rodmell,—blank—reason for blank forgotten as well as blanks contents. If I give my reason, I shall waste my time & energy."
1922.06.23,"I was telling lies to Dorothy Bussy the other day about this very book—how I lived in writing—& wrote & wrote in the streets—& coming home floated it off here. I think I’ve been working too hard; talking too much; to open this book. Working at copying Jacob after tea. That, of course, deserves a page or two—my premonitory shivers. As for the talk, it has been all about love & lies with Ralph. We have had a mad bull in the house—a normal Englishman in love; & deceived. My comments could fill a book, & perhaps will fill a book. I don’t find it possible to excuse all, as tradition exacts, & Ralph agrees that it should exact. In short, I don’t like the normal when it is at 1000 horse power. His stupidity, blindness, callousness, struck me more powerfully than the magic virtues of passion. And yet it was interesting—very genuine, on his part; save for the flimsy disguise with which he tried to excuse himself. I began by believing his story—that C. had lied in matters of such importance that their relations were now forever damaged. But he concealed some essentials; how he had treated her, so as to foster lies. She supplied some very queer facts, one, that he flew into a passion (& his passions are like those in books) because she got naked with V. Dobrée. And he thinks this fine. “But I am like that.” “You’re a maniac” I said. Indeed I shouted it in the train coming back from Roger’s lecture. I lost my temper. We bellowed across the trains rattling. He foxes his eyes; turns rose pink; looks like taking aim at a rabbit. Shouts louder & louder. “I should have left you if you had treated me like that.” He does not answer. That is his good point. Old Victorian sherry drinking Squire though he is, one can launch out at him, & he is trained enough to stand fire. She is far sub⁠[t]⁠ler & more civilised; a lier, I daresay; but then one must lie to children. After this, & I think a little on account of my bellowing, a reconciliation took place. At least he chatters again today, & won’t allude to it. Lytton is gone, & so is Valentine. But I sketch this, partly from discretion, partly from haste, & so leave out the links. It was the stupidity of virility that impressed me—& how, having made those convenient railway lines of convention, the lusts speed along them, unquestioning. She is not in love—with anyone, I expect; though Lytton has the afterglow of any passion she has. & this queers R.’s pitch.

Now I have little time for anything else. We have seen a great many people. Roger’s lectures provide a rendezvous. Eliot dined last Sunday & read his poem. He sang it & chanted it rhythmed it. It has great beauty & force of phrase: symmetry; & tensity. What connects it together, I’m not so sure. But he read till he had to rush—letters to write about the London Magazine—& discussion thus was curtailed. One was left, however, with some strong emotion. The Waste Land, it is called; & Mary Hutch, who has heard it more quietly, interprets it to be Tom’s autobiography—a melancholy one. Yes, Mary kissed me on the stairs. That was after the Memoir Club. Lytton & Morgan read; & our standard is such that little is left for me to hint & guess at. They say what they mean, very brilliantly; & leave the dark as it was before. Then Mary crossed the room & purred in my ear. Molly grows very deaf, & I scold myself for not sitting next her. She puts her chin on her hand & looks wistfully round: says random rather disconsolate [things]. Morgan, who is now out & about again, thanks to Leonard’s advice, very calm, serene, like a kettle boiling by some private fire, a fire at Weybridge, spent the night here after the Dinner, & then we sat round the table & discussed his book. Our list grows more & more distinguished, but why is there no boom in Tolstoi? No one buys Karn, or Fredegond; but Bunin sells now fairly well. Jacob, as I say, is being typed by Miss Green, & crosses the Atlantic on July 14th. Then will begin my season of doubts & ups & downs. I am guarding myself in this way. I am going to be well on with a story for Eliot, lives for Squire, & Reading, so that I can vary the side of the pillow as fortune inclines. If they say this is all a clever experiment, I shall produce Mrs Dalloway in Bond Street as the finished product. If they say your fiction is impossible, I shall say what about Miss Ormerod, a fantasy. If they say, You can’t make us care a damn for any of your figures—I shall say, read my criticism then. Now what will they say about Jacob? Mad, I suppose: a disconnected rhapsody: I don’t know. I will confide my view to this book on re-reading. On rereading novels is the title of a very laborious, yet rather gifted article, for the Supt. And Leonard is going to make £3,000 a year, via Mr & Mrs Holt, an incredible couple, who spent an incredible afternoon with us at Monks. “He sells everything—he’ll be selling me next” she says, very arch.

Mr Holt half winked, & cocked his head.

“Little woman, little woman” said Mr Holt.

“He’s the straightest boy that ever lived” said Mrs Holt, not without emotion.

“No there’s nothing to be done with books. Henry isn’t at all keen I should try. Henry made £30 by an hours work this morning. He keeps his mother, & his orphan sister & her child in a semi detached house with two maids. Everything as nice as it can be.”

Mr Holt looked L. straight in the eyes—liked to talk business alone—praised the house & garden too lavishly. Very much in the style of a best seller himself. Perfectly unreal, sentimental, & not, in spite of Mrs Holt, very straight, I should say."
1922.07.17,"Back from Garsington, & too unsettled to write—I meant to say read; but then this does not count as writing. It is to me like scratching; or, if it goes well, like having a bath—which of course, I did not get at Garsington. But Julian said at breakfast this morning that she wanted to be rich in order to have hot baths. Philip replied that they are now laying on water. Then Julian said she wanted to put milk in her bath, if it kept her complexion. She didn’t mind being a fine lady. She wanted to come to London; but “mummy only goes for operations & horrid things like that. I did once stay with Brett, but they wouldn’t let me go again.” O. & P. stood by with their long cold noses peering into letters assiduously.

But this was the last 10 minutes of my stay. I don’t know that any incident burnt through the long windy cold day. I liked old Birrell’s stories. He is a very well matured vintage: the barrel round & tight & mellow; & the wine within bright & sweet, & not lacking tang either. At least he laid down the law very briskly about Logan’s character: “nasty”—& Lady Colefax—a bore “I prefer Sir Alfred who makes all the money. When fat old gentlemen like myself go to the house, those rogueish Sitwell boys sit at the window opposite & cry through a megaphone ‘The Ambassador from Sweden’…” His account of the society into which Logan introduced me the other day was not rosy. A general distrust, hidden satire, gorging of pate de fois gras in public, improprieties, & incessant celebrities. Birrell does it—sits there, I suppose, by way of distraction; & pays for his tea by talk. Ottoline has her little green book room with the gilt pillars stuffed with pretty yellow books. There I sat, crouching over the fire, & we talked, rather on our guard—a little toothless, perhaps. Much disillusioned she said she was, but now indifferent to disillusionment. So we had the case of Aldous Huxley—a pretty poor one “mere marionettes, not you at all—mere marionettes—why should mere marionettes destroy a long & cherished friendship? Yours very affectionately Aldous Huxley.” But mere marionettes have destroyed it. There is Murry pleading & whining to be taken in at the Bailiffs house, with a view to Oxford honours, so Birrell shrewdly said. Still we were low in tone—had she not an operation on her bladder two days before? But energy ran like whips through her. Tea was a long rambling meal—I had Mrs Seligman [unidentified] to talk to; & plunged into her hidden tragedy—a boy undeveloped; & a girl dead. Her poor wretched hunted hare face lit it all up. The boy, she says, has, she knows, a most remarkable mind, but cant read at 11. Sheppard was there with his shiny Homers beneath his arm, depressed, & O. sought to raise his spirits by calling him the happiest of men.

P. drove me into Oxford this morning; & there was Miss Margesson on the platform. This takes me back to last week; my party at Logan’s: at Mary’s; at the Squires. Yes: I saw Lady Colefax & likened her to hard red cherries on a cheap black hat. And Lady Lewis was there, who remembered my mother before she married my father & thought her the most beautiful, the most delightful, of women “—you’re very good looking, too, but not like her”.

One gets flattered & stimulated at these places; & I found myself thinking of fame, & seeing doors open before me; but I was too much of a coward to walk in to Kent House the next day to meet la Princesse de Polignac, Lytton Strachey, & others. But one of these days no doubt I shall. But to make one love literature—this is the way. I have skimped all this disgracefully, & here vow to stitch myself a new book, & start fresh at Rodmell.

The 1917 Club has opened its new rooms, & is infested with Mayors & Husseys, (who has written a book in the style of Lytton).

Leonard has been offered Brailsford’s post on the Nation; & has taken it, short of note writing. He is quit of The Contemporary in January.

Philip is back, & installed at Waddesden.

I am finishing Jacob’s Room.

Grizzel [a dog] now belongs to us.

I have seen Hope, Logan, Lady Cromer, Hussey, Duncan, & I don’t know who all this last week, but have said nothing.

We dine in the drawing room—the dining room being given over to print & Ralph (he annoys us both considerably). My temp, goes on, as usual, & Dr Hamill thinks that my right lung is suspicious. Fergusson says no. And perhaps I shall have to see Sainsbury to settle it."
1922.07.19,"I will seize the opportunity of tea being done, Ralph gone, & Leonard writing letters, to pay some of my dues here. I put aside Mary to write about. One very cold wet night last week, or week before, she dined with me, alone, Leonard out, no servants; rain making the streets swim. I opened the door, & there she was with her white Pierrot face, black satin, orange shawl, laced shoes—the whole outfit merely to dine with me in the rain. She is an impulsive generous woman, whose generosity still exists; but subterraneously I think, floored over by her society varnish, & only let issue by people who don’t compete. She started off upon her treatment by Vanessa, & this was the object of her visit, I suspect; to get me, I mean, to act ambassador. But, at my age, I tend to believe in the moment, more than in posthumous reflections. She was nice enough to me, chattering about her new dress for Chrissie [MacLaren]’s party; &, whether I was deluded or not I dont know, but she seemed able to put up some defence against my literary observations. That she may repel me with Tom’s arguments is no doubt true. All I maintain (& I maintain this against Nessa & Leonard) is that she showed up well on that occasion; & indeed I suspect that Nessa unintentionally flattens her more than she suspects. The situation is against nature. Nature outs, under disguise, which of course complicates. Sitting at the kitchen table at no. 50 I had this out with Nessa; & I remember how pleased I was to be taking my ease there, & not tiptoeing in the cold at Lady Colefax’s—to meet the Princesse de Polignac. Nothing can be done says Nessa. Moreover, nothing needs to be done, since in October Clive sets up at no. 50, & can entertain Mary there. In fact, says Nessa, all this palaver about friendship with N. is merely a selfseeking device to improve M.’s own position, which, in the autumn, may need re-inforcing. And M. has set Clive against Lydia, & so turned off Maynard; & then one night she kissed Roger, & set afloat the usual contrary stories; altogether, her character is too much in holes for this last attempt to patch it up, & my embassy was fruitless. The truth is, as I am fond of beginning my sentence, that alliances of this kind always cut grooves somewhere or other—being contrary to all passion; & you cant, even in 1922, do what Plato & Shakespeare couldn’t do. No intelligence bridles the old hag—nature, to wit.

Ralph’s old hag is temporarily under control. Today he has a story that Maynard & Lytton are to buy the English Review from Austin Harrison, set him up as drudge, pay their contributors £10.10. a thousand words, & beat all rivals. If Ralph wants it, then I think Lytton may agree; not otherwise. At Garsington they were getting up a subscription to give Tom £300, & so free him from journalism. These two bits of gossip seem to belong together; & there was a third—that the Nation contributors have signed a Round Robin asking that Murry be removed—which leads naturally to Sydney Waterlow the other night—Yes, he dined here, in his pearl tie pin. I thought him sweeter, more reasonable, than usual. He has lost his last shreds of belief in Murry, save in Murry’s Criticism, but as this too, depends upon spites & whims, I don’t think even that can be saved from the wreck. Sydney is very proud of his lawn & his fruit trees. He wishes his children were bigger. The little boy promises to be intelligent. Parents never mask their pride successfully. How proud Philip & Ottoline were because Julian could say Prufrock by heart! But bitterness struggles with Ottoline’s pride. “Half a dozen tennis balls are quite enough. You only leave them out in the wet.” “I dont leave them out in the wet, Mummy”,—typical of many breakfast talks, no doubt. But Sydney is softer, for the moment, & did not blow & bellow as much as usual.

Now, I never talked to Hussey (who is Mrs Enfield) about her book, though she accosted me in the Club for that purpose, for these reasons. She doe⁠[s]⁠n’t praise my writing. She imitates Lytton. And she doesn’t know the art of reading. Never, for goodness sake, set yourself to read Balzac through & talk about it. If you must do these athletics, do them in the bathroom. Somehow the connection between life & literature must be made by women: & they so seldom do it right. There was Hussey stalking beside me to the London Library (though I wished to be alone) & mincing out highly intelligent remarks beneath the horses noses, about seeing things like God & setting the cap on, & I so much rather she’d talk about her cat, her cook, or her weekly bills. But, of course, she didn’t praise me. And she marries the dullest man in London, & they travel in Italy. What is worth while? Only feeling things for yourself—& this, I dont think poor Hussey dares do. One might feel, for example, that Ralph [Enfield] was a bore, & Balzac sometimes dull. Can you like Balzac if you like Ralph? That’s what I ask myself when I talk to Hussey. She is an ironmongers daughter, & thus the chain of Lytton galls her neck."
1922.07.22,"My conscience drives me again to write.

“This is real rain” says L. at the window.

“Mrs Thomsett wont have to go right up somewhere to get pails of water” says Lottie.

It is pouring heavy, straight, thick. Puddles stand in the garden. It is stuffy, dirty skyed. A white mist of rain blows off the roofs. One poor plant is bent over. We have just had Saturday tea, at Yes he does in Friday Nights which we read the weeklies, & abused poor cur Murry. He slobbers over Garnett this week, which suggests that Garnett has slobbered over him. You can’t write criticism without being a good man, so I maintain. One always sees the soul through words.

Clive came to tea yesterday, & offered me only the faded & fly blown remnants of his mind. He had been up late. So had I—at the pictures. For my own part, all my strings are jangled by a night out. Dissipation would rot my writing (such as it is, I put in, modestly). Words next day dance patterns in my mind. It takes me a week to recover from Lady Colefax—who by the way invites me for Friday. Col-fox = black fox. This is from my Chaucer reading. The question yesterday was about Lytton & the English Review. Would it be good or bad for his writing? Ralph says that he is depressed; blocked by the play he can’t write—& never will be able to write, say I; & if he lubricated himself with journalism, he might reel off some history or biography, & so pass by the play unmoved; & this is his line, & a good one, too, I say. But Leonard thinks that my view & Ralph’s are temporal compromising views, to which Lytton ought not to listen. Partly I am influenced by a wish for the fun of the thing—12 numbers of a new review written by the most brilliant of the age—myself among them, paid double: London Mercury killed, &c. &c. But James is spending this wet Sunday at Tidmarsh; & James will addle the egg.

If Lytton takes it, Ralph is to be business manager, & leave us. Well? We are polite, but we don’t sigh. And here is a long letter from Dobree, opened by mistake, showing that R. is in mischief again. His spirits are down, & even the servants notice his surliness. Poor young man! For really he was never meant for intellectual whirlpools. No: he was meant for punts in backwaters, gramophones, ices, flirtations, a pretty wife, large family, & interests in the City. Nature is perpetually driving him to convert Tidmarsh into the likeness of this, & so everything goes athwart him. We have bad luck with our prentices. Next time we must stipulate for eunuchs.

Hamill sticks to it that my right lung is wrong. Fergusson finds nothing. Pneumonia germs have been discovered. And my case is to be laid before Sainsbury on the 9th—all rather a bore."
1922.07.26,"Just in from tea with the Mirrlees; who are vulgar, L. says: & I think I agree. They have vulgar friends. “Pocky”—the girls name was, to whom Hope & I talked. She & the second housemaid had been carrying a salmon about London. She told us the story of her cornelians. Her mother now keeps her jewels, because she can’t be trusted. Her mother calls her ‘little girl’; & her nostrils opened too wide, & she was self-possessed, & crude & cut a dash, & had no mind, & had the shingles in her hair, & would sit on gossiping with Hope, who seemed to like it all better than I thought right. Rub off the top varnish—life, youth, colour, wealth (which we grant Pocky) & what remains? A dull old woman.

On Sunday L. read through Jacob’s Room. He thinks it my best work. But his first remark was that it was amazingly well written. We argued about it. He calls it a work of genius; he thinks it unlike any other novel; he says that the people are ghosts; he says it is very strange: I have no philosophy of life he says; my people are puppets, moved hither & thither by fate. He doesn’t agree that fate works in this way. Thinks I should use my ‘method’, on one or two characters next time; & he found it very interesting, & beautiful, & without lapse (save perhaps the party) & quite intelligible. Pocky has so disturbed my mind that I cannot write this as formally as it deserves, for I was anxious & excited. But I am on the whole pleased. Neither of us knows what the public will think. There’s no doubt in my mind that I have found out how to begin (at 40) to say something in my own voice; & that interests me so that I feel I can go ahead without praise."
1922.07.28,"The affairs of the P⁠[artridge]⁠s. have engrossed us for 2 hours again; & a postscript had to be added to Lytton on the telephone. I’m afraid its a sordid business, as C. said. Nor do I like to see women unhappy. P.’s conduct is that of the village Don Juan. Again, he behaves like a bull in a garden. And with it he is malicious. He is a male bully, as L. says. I am reminded of the tantrums of Adrian & Clive. There is something maniacal in masculine vanity.

August. 1922 Rodmell"
1922.08.03,"Owing to the change of ink & the change of place, I here begin a new page. Twice a year I make good resolutions—in August & October. My good resolution for August is to work methodically, yet with the grain not against it. Often, my wisdom teaches me, good resolutions wither because forced. And modern science teaches us to respect pleasure, or that is my reading.

I should make one of my little addings up of days, since there is a break. On the whole a good summer; by which I mean that pleasures—dining out, seeing people,—were rather successfully combined with reading & writing & staying at home. On the whole, L. & I are becoming celebrities. L. would deny this; but then he did not go to Logan’s tea party, nor to Garsington. Still I draw my observation from other sources. Reputation seems to accumulate, though we published nothing this year. Mrs Nicolson thinks me the best woman writer—& I have almost got used to Mrs Nicolson’s having heard of me. But it gives me some pleasure. Again, I am on freer terms with my little world, & have the chance I think to expand it, only no money to buy clothes. I am horribly in debt for Joyce & Proust at this moment, & must sell books directly I get back to London.

We ended our season last Monday at the Commercio, with Clive & Roger. Roger came in with his hair flying & his coat flying carrying canvases—his mouth open, his eyes searching round—& we had our usual talk. Clive had his bits of gossip; & did I not by my evil eye inspire one of them? Mrs Shanks (so they say) has left the Georgian poet. But Tom, coming round to Gordon Square afterwards, was by no means so certain of this as I could wish. Tom was sardonic, guarded, precise, & slightly malevolent, as usual. Clive, of course, on his good behaviour. He sounded me as to a visit to Wittering. Nessa had the mumps downstairs. Duncan drifted in, soft haired, vague, gentle as usual. And Roger undid his canvases, & leant 2 portraits of Logan against the sofa. “Yes, I think that is the best portrait I have done so far” he said. “I think I have never carried anything quite so far as that head.” He is 55 I suppose; & still thinks he is about to begin to paint as he should—a merciful dispensation—a carrot to lure him across the desert. But it is no desert to Roger. Every faculty is used & burnished, & some fairly on the way to be worn out. He suffers, consults doctors, aches & shivers, but eternally goes on. The perfect man, as I told him, & as indeed I believe him to be. He is off to spend the summer painting with Derain. It is his obsession now—to paint, paint, paint. Nothing else is worth doing. Pamela is marrying, or failing to marry, her Roumanian Jew.

Yesterday I walked to the top of Asheham hill, & found colonies of mushrooms on the way. The house now looks a little rigid & fixed, the country shut in, & severe compared with this. But the garden here, with the outhouses & their ivy down, is a lovely patch—open & airy with views of the hills; & so far Ted Hunter remains quiescent. The rot has set in, I hope, & I pray that Ted Hunter’s wife may now elope with Mr Belloc. Allison will then lose his fortune, &, Bowen being with child by Shanks, the Hawkesfords will leave, & the Woolves be left by themselves in chastity & glory.

I must broach a new page to announce the beginning, the true not spurious beginning, of Reading this morning. I shall write next that I have never enjoyed any writing more, or felt more certain of success. Jacob’s Room is crossing the Atlantic."
1922.08.16,"I should be reading Ulysses, & fabricating my case for & against. I have read 200 pages so far—not a third; & have been amused, stimulated, charmed interested by the first 2 or 3 chapters—to the end of the Cemetery scene; & then puzzled, bored, irritated, & disillusioned as by a queasy undergraduate scratching his pimples. And Tom, great Tom, thinks this on a par with War & Peace! An illiterate, underbred book it seems to me: the book of a self taught working man, & we all know how distressing they are, how egotistic, insistent, raw, striking, & ultimately nauseating. When one can have the cooked flesh, why have the raw? But I think if you are anaemic, as Tom is, there is a glory in blood. Being fairly normal myself I am soon ready for the classics again. I may revise this later. I do not compromise my critical sagacity. I plant a stick in the ground to mark page 200.

For my own part I am laboriously dredging my mind for Mrs Dalloway & bringing up light buckets. I don’t like the feeling I’m writing too quickly. I must press it together. I wrote 4 thousand words of reading in record time, 10 days; but then it was merely a quick sketch of Pastons, supplied by books. Now I break off, according to my quick change theory, to write Mrs D. (who ushers in a host of others, I begin to perceive) then I do Chaucer; & finish the first chapter early in September. By that time, I have my Greek beginning perhaps, in my head; & so the future is all pegged out; & when Jacob is rejected in America & ignored in England, I shall be philosophically driving my plough fields away. They are cutting the corn all over the country, which supplies that metaphor, & perhaps excuses it. But I need no excuses, since I am not writing for the Lit Sup. Shall I ever write for them again?

I see I have said nothing about our day in London [on 9 August]—Dr Sainsbury, Dr Fergusson, & the semi-legal discussion over my body, which ended in a bottle of quinine pills, & a box of lozenges, & a brush to varnish my throat with. Influenza & pneumonia germs, perhaps, says Sainsbury, very softly, wisely & with extreme deliberation. “Equanimity—practise equanimity Mrs Woolf” he said, as I left; an unnecessary interview from my point of view; but we were forced into it by one step after another on the part of the bacteriologists. I take my temperature no more till Oct. 1st.

Meanwhile, there is the question of Ralph. This—it is the old question of his lumpiness, grumpiness, slovenliness, & stupidity versus his niceness, strength, fundamental amiability & connections—has been forced on us by one of Roger’s suggestions—a man called Whittal, wants to come in: young, intelligent, with a motor car, well dressed, sociable, & critical; living in London, & not pressed for money. I am a little alarmed by the social values of Mr W. for we don’t want the Press to be a fashionable hobby patronised & inspired by Chelsea. Whittal lives only two doors off Logan."
1922.08.22,"On this day, I don’t know how many years ago, 1897 to be precise, Jack came to Hindhead & was accepted by Stella in the moonlit garden. We wandered about the house till she came in & told us. Thoby thought they were tramps. I tried to describe the little trees in the moonlight. 1922

1897

25 Jack was accepted in Tyndall’s little study on that bare heath twenty five years ago. As she died so soon after, somehow it still seems to me like a real thing, unsmothered by the succeeding years.

But I always have to confess, when I write diary in the morning. It is only 11.30 to be honest, & I have left off Mrs Dalloway in Bond Street; & really why is it? I should very much like to account for my depression. Sydney Waterlow spent the week end here; & yesterday we had a days outing at Brighton. At Brighton I saw a lovely blue Victorian dress, which L. advised me not to buy. Sydney reproduced in his heavy lifeless voice exactly the phrases in which Murry dismisses my writing “merely silly—one simply doesn’t read it—you’re a back number.” Then Squire rejected Leonard’s story; & perhaps I dont like seeing new houses built all about; & get edgy about our field. So now I have assembled my facts—to which I now add my spending 10/6 on photographs, which we developed in my dress cupboard last night; & they are all failures. Compliments, clothes, building, photography—it is for these reasons that I cannot write Mrs Dalloway. Indeed it is fatal to have visitors, even like Clive for one day, in the middle of a story. I had just got up steam. All that agony now has to begin again. And Sydney, however one may discount him beforehand, is always a feather bed on a hot night—ponderous, meritorious, stuffy. The stuffing is now provided by Kot & Sullivan, who have provided him with a new outfit. Everything is conscientiously revised by their not, to me, penetrating flame; & if the process is done in one’s presence it becomes, I don’t know why, curiously enervating, humiliating & depressing. Some rooms always smell mouldy—good well built rooms too. No one ever suffered so acutely from atmosphere as I do; & my leaves drooped one by one; though heaven knows my root is firm enough. As L. very truly says there is too much ego in my cosmos.

In fact, Sydney was lighter in hand than I have known him. He had made a vow, for at 45 he makes vows, not to discuss his personal affairs. A deep groan intimated so much when we approached the delectable subject. No: he must refrain. We passed the door. And he got naked & bathed, & made the river look many sizes too small. He is a soft pink mass when naked. We talked too much about Murry. Still, it would have been as⁠[c]⁠etic not to, considering our lack of subjects of equal value. Yet Sydney considers that he can talk about literature. He can pick up a pencil doubtless; but the chances are he picks up half a dozen. I am thinking of Thoreau, whose fineness of touch was proved by some dealing of his with pencils. I mean that Sydney is entirely without fineness of touch. His grandmother was a ratcatcher’s daughter: his grandfather a printer’s devil: both facts which he profoundly regrets. And so do I.

I am once more writing off the fidgets. Ah, but how divinely happy we were until 12.30 on Thursday when Clive boarded the enchanted island with news from the world of Mary & Colefax! Never have I been so happy in my life. The day was like a perfect piece of cabinet making—beautifully fitted with beautiful compartments. It rained (I think) things must have happened in the same way & same order as today; but how differently! I could hardly keep my temper ordering dinner this morning—& so on. But I shall walk to Asheham & try to start the machine again. The odd thing is that neither of us wishes for visitors. Of course they threaten us from all sides—Partridges, M⁠[olly]. Hamilton, Americans, Lytton, Morgan, Tom, Sangers—no: leave me, leave me, is all I say: to work my brain.

Boen [Hawkesford] came to tea on Sunday—a cheap piece of crockery, for her nose reminds one of a tea pot spout; her mouth is like a slot in coarse china. She is changing; reading Bliss under Shanks’ orders; wishes to live in London in order to work; not dance; & hurried off to play tennis with him, I suppose. I surprised them on the river bank swimming the great sheep dog “They got him from a shepherd here” says Boen, with a strange accent or tremor on they, as if ‘they’ were past, yet not dead; & so, under pretext of exercising the dog, the walking out which Mrs Dedman so strongly disapproves, goes on; leading according to Sydney, to a life of misery for Shanks, Boen getting her claws into him, clinging to him, drawing him under.

“Rot!” I said. Poor man. I look forward to his Collins. Tuesday cont.

Slowly the cloud withdraws. Not that I can put pen to paper at this moment; but the waters, which that great grampus dislodged, meet together again. I am once more washed by the flood, warm, embracing, fertilising, of my own thoughts. I am too feeble to analyse the psychology, which I guess to be interesting. Its as if some foreign body had dispersed reality for the moment; the foreign body being of some gross material, inimical to thought. And if I can only protect this for the present, I shall be able to write. So the question for me is, how far to withdraw from unsympathetic society in the future? Is this cowardly, or merely good sense? For instance, here is Brett already inviting us into the heart of the enemies camp—Hampstead Thursday evenings. If I go I shall be rasped all over, or at any rate dulled & blunted, by the presence of Sullivan, Kot & Sydney. If I don’t go shall I soften & rot in the too mild atmosphere of my own familiars? Perhaps the best plan would be to live in a neutral territory—neither friend nor foe, & by this means sink the exacting claims of egoism. Is there such a society possible though?

I have ordered the blue silk dress, & must now save 10/- a week towards it.—six weeks that is. But if I save the money here, I waste it at the other end, so I have imposed this task upon myself with some amusement.

The way to rock oneself back into writing is this. First gentle exercise in the air. Second the reading of good literature. It is a mistake to think that literature can be produced from the raw. One must get out of life—yes, thats why I disliked so much the irruption of Sydney—one must become externalised; very, very concentrated, all at one point, not having to draw upon the scattered parts of one’s character, living in the brain. Sydney comes & I’m Virginia; when I write I’m merely a sensibility. Sometimes I like being Virginia, but only when I’m scattered & various & gregarious. Now, so long as we are here, I’d like to be only a sensibility. By the way, Thackeray is good reading, very vivacious, with ‘touches’, as they call them over the way at the Shank⁠[s]⁠es’, of astonishing insight.

I have so many letters to write: to Jacques (& he praised Monday or Tuesday highly; & I like to please Jacques; yet Jacques’ praises never outweigh dull donkey Sydney’s dispraises) to Ka; to Carrington; to—I forget; & shan’t bother, but shall now rock myself into literature by reading Ulysses!"
1922.08.23,"A headache: no writing; so I will copy.

Aug. 21 1922

My Dear Virginia,

The atmosphere was extraordinarily propitious; such an effluence of beauty from the landscape & the air, with that healing touch that I’ve always found in those parts, but there was more than that. As the hours slipped by, so few & so fast, I felt more & more a deep satisfaction at having begun again with you at having picked up broken pieces & being able to hold them together with some firmness. I hope it isn’t imaginary; it seems quite solid, like something really won & earned, a real step forward in this horrific pilgrimage in which we’re all engaged. I might so easily have come away feeling it had been merely a raking over of ashes; I was quite prepared for that; my mind was open. But on the contrary! I feel enriched & alive, delighted to think you are there & are you, & not even minding a bit if you think I’m a perfect ass.

Now for an excitement. I was just beginning to write this when the telephone rung. Bewildering noises, with shouts of ‘I cant hear you’ from me, a voice I seemed to know, & then I caught a name: ‘Katherine?’ ‘Sydney, are you my enemy?’ ‘Good God, NO!’ She’s in Brett’s house at Hampstead. Thats all I could make out. I’m going to see her on Wednesday. The plot thickens.

Ever yours

S.W."
1922.08.25,"I have no time to comment. Indeed, it is a little stale, so I leave it to amuse a fresh eye. I think, still tentatively, that I have begun the story again—Brailsford writes to ask me to contribute stories &c to his new Leader. The Times (weekly) says my novels are by some thought among the finest of our time. Yet, yet, I am not quite past the depression of hearing Sydney repeat what Murry said. Did I not mention a headache, though? Common sense informs me that, when the blood ebbs, any fly can settle. One can’t brush them off. Oddly, though, sun shine, in these conditions, hardly illumines."
1922.08.26,"Having done my morning’s writing, at 11.20, & filled a whole page not so badly after all, I may as well let my brain finish its run on this more terrestrial soil. It is a fine day—one of the dozen this summer. I dont think I have said enough about the splintered disorder of June, July & August. A broken china closet it makes me think of—so many smashes & tergivasations. But today is fine, & yesterday we went to Charleston by the Bus, for the first time. After all, one must respect civilisation. This thought came to me standing in a Brighton street the other day from which one sees the downs. Mankind was fuming & fretting & shouldering each other about; the down was smoothly sublime. But I thought this street frenzy is really the better of the two—the more courageous. One must put up a fight against passive turf, with an occasional snail, & a swell in the ground which it takes 2,000 years to produce. But I daresay this thought was forced upon me: I much prefer the downs myself.

Charleston is as usual. One hears Clive shouting in the garden before one arrives. Nessa emerges from a great variegated quilt of asters & artichokes; not very cordial; a little absent minded. Clive bursts out of his shirt; sits square in his chair & bubbles. Then Duncan drifts in, also vague, absent minded, & incredibly wrapped round with yellow waistcoats, spotted ties, & old blue stained painting jackets. His trousers have to be hitched up constantly. He rumples his hair. However, I can’t help thinking that we grow in cordiality, instead of drifting out of sight. And why not stand on one’s own legs, & defy them, even in the matter of hats & chaircovers? Surely at the age of forty…. Nessa, who concentrates upon one subject, & one only, with a kind of passive ferocity which I find alarming, took L. off primarily to discuss her attitude to Mary. Clive & I are much alike in our haphazard dealings with people. We do not concentrate; we are easily gulled & flattered; we expand & contract; we chatter & gossip; there is something much more fell, stable & determined in the characters of my sister & husband. Really, they can both determine a relationship & hold to it.

As for Duncan he requires, I think, peace for painting. He would like it all settled one way or the other. We saw a perfectly black rabbit, & a perfectly black cat, sitting on the road, with its tail laid out like a strap.

“What they call an example of melanism” said Clive—which amused me very much, & also made me like him. Why should this absurd trifle affect me when far more serious things make no impression whatever? And could one ever imagine this in the case of another person?

I dislike Ulysses more & more—that is think it more & more unimportant; & dont even trouble conscientiously to make out its meanings. Thank God, I need not write about it. Yes, Murry actually goes out of his way to drag in my name with moderate praise today. This must mean that he is coming to live in London; requires a dinner, anyhow people to get up & welcome him when he comes into a room."
1922.08.28,"I am beginning Greek again, & must really make out some plan: today 28th: Mrs Dalloway finished on Sat. 2nd Sept: Sunday 3rd to Friday 8th start Chaucer: Chaucer—that chapter, I mean, should be finished by Sept. 22nd. And then? Shall I write the next chapter of Mrs D.—if she is to have a next chapter; & shall it be The Prime Minister? which will last till the week after we get back—say Oct. 12th. Then I must be ready to start my Greek chapter. So I have from today, 28th till 12th—which is just over 6 weeks—but I must allow for some interruptions. Now what have I to read? Some Homer: one Greek play; some Plato; Zimmern; Sheppard, as text book; Bentley’s Life. If done thoroughly, this will be enough. But which Greek play? & how much Homer, & what Plato? Then there’s the Anthology. All to end upon the Odyssey because of the Elizabethans. And I must read a little Ibsen to compare with Euripides—Racine with Sophocles—perhaps Marlowe with Aeschylus. Sounds very learned; but really might amuse me. & if it doesn’t, no need to go on."
1922.09.03,"Perhaps the greatest revolution in my life is the change of nibs—no longer can I write legibly with my old blunt tree stump—people complained—But then the usual difficulties begin—what is to take its place At the present moment I’m using Blackie [a fountain pen] against his nature, dipping him, that is to say. I should be reading the last immortal chapter of Ulysses: but I’m hot with Badmington in the orchard; L. is stamping the distemper down on my head, & we dine in 35 minutes & I must change, & the Sangers are coming in afterwards, I’m fretful with people. Every day will now be occupied till Tuesday week. So this is my last chance so far as diary goes, I daresay.

Walking in the church yard on Friday evening I made this remark—Its a very odd thing considering how impressive these country church-yards are, & how common…. when we saw Dora Sanger being escorted towards us by a stout country woman. On introduction we discovered this to be Daphne, aged 16: a nice, sleek headed, brown eyed girl; in a macintosh. Now I had pictured her aged 6 or 10, still being given her bath by Charlie. We have met daily since; & as I say, they come round tonight, to sit up here & look at the view. Dora will look at the view Charlie prefers spiritual scenery. And we never really show signs of running out of talk. I have only to say, what was a Greek bedroom like in the age of Pericles, & Charlie puts it before one.

Charlie, I was saying, puts it before one. And Daphne is very well informed, & how adorable the young are—like new brooms. I long to look over their shoulders, & see them sweeping clean. Indeed I much prefer them to the distinguished, wrapped soft in their reputations. She is at Bedales; goes to Newnham; then proposes to reform the world, by a moderate kind of revolution, so far as I understand her—for we only stood a second talking under the shadow of the tree outside the Rest, last night. She will write pamphlets, as a beginning. And the truth is that the world is reformed by Daphne Sanger’s pamphlets—no doubt about it. At her age I was for knowing all that was to be known, & for writing a book—a book—But what book? That vision came to me more clearly at Manorbier aged 21, walking the down on the edge of the sea. Never have I contrived so to wedge myself into my work as this summer—I cant endure interruptions. Maynard has asked us to Oare, where he keeps house with Lydia, & I should like to go, but we shan’t. The new plan of rotating my crops is working well so far: I am always in a fizz & a stew, either to get my views on Chaucer clear, or on the Odyssey, or to sketch my next chapter. A polite letter from Harcourt Brace informs me that my MS has not arrived—& they take great interest in my work. This comes of not registering the parcel—L.’s fault, I’m glad to say. I am galloping on, astride a J pen now, not very compactly; but the whole day has been dissipated, & now I must tidy the room.

Yes, on looking at the pages, I think the balance is all in favour of a steel nib. Blackie too smooth; the old blunderbuses too elephantine. Look how neat this is."
1922.09.06,"Visitors leave one in tatters; yet with a relish for words. Phrases roll on my tongue—which, really, one can’t produce for the delectation of my mother in law & Flora; who are now on their way back to Lewes; Carrington & Partridge being on their way to Chiddingley; the Sangers being on their way up Asheham Hill; & Lytton beginning to consider being on his way here.

We had our premeditated interview last night, with Ralph lying on the bed up here. Did his face show any change as Leonard went on—very forcible, measured, & impersonal. “Things have been unsatisfactory in my opinion” & so on. Ralph put up no more defence than a flock of sheep, which is disarming. So it is too to find him privately so enthusiastic about the H.P. that he could not contemplate any other career. I think it shapes itself into his becoming our printer; We take on Whitall as partner; & so start again—for ever. He is ready to face for ever, if we are, & money difficulties can be arranged. It is clear that he must live in London. Carrington is going to sit out his infidelities; which she does with her lips tight shut. She is going to paint. But she will never be a young woman again.

We had a great chatter party on Monday—Maynard, Nessa, Duncan, the Sangers. But how could I repeat the talk? It was a success though, save for the dim grey weather. Maynard is going to build a house: N. & D. are going to draw an income for 10 years from it. It is to be a hotel, perfectly appointed, in a field off Beanstalk Lane—8 suites of rooms, with 8 bathrooms, kitchens, waterclosets, surrounding a courtyard; in short a Peacock novel in stone; soon filled with the characters. No doubt we have re-arranged life almost completely. Our parents were mere triflers at the game—went to the grave with all the secret (drawers) springs unpressed. Maynard, besides being our greatest living economist, has a dancer for mistress, & is now preparing to stage a Mozart ballet, with 13 nimble dancers; interviews the Coliseum Manager; is an expert at contracts; knows the points of dancers, & can tell you all about the amours at the Imperial academy at Petersburg. Then Duncan is going to dance with Lydia. And Roger—but I need not go through the list; for my point is the same—we have all mastered the art of life, & very fascinating it is. Am I not about to manufacture coloured papers?

My proofs [of Jacob’s Room] come every other day, & I could depress myself adequately if I went into that. The thing now reads thin & pointless; the words scarcely dint the paper; & I expect to be told that I’ve written a graceful fantasy, without much bearing upon real life. Can one tell? Anyhow, nature obligingly supplies me with the illusion that I am about to write something good: something rich, & deep, & fluent & hard as nails, while bright as diamonds.

I finished Ulysses, & think it a mis-fire. Genius it has I think; but of the inferior water. The book is diffuse. It is brackish. It is pretentious. It is underbred, not only in the obvious sense, but in the literary sense. A first rate writer, I mean, respects writing too much to be tricky; startling; doing stunts. I’m reminded all the time of some callow board school boy, say like Henry Lamb, full of wits & powers, but so self-conscious & egotistical that he loses his head, becomes extravagant, mannered, uproarious, ill at ease, makes kindly people feel sorry for him, & stern ones merely annoyed; & one hopes he’ll grow out of it; but as Joyce is 40 this scarcely seems likely. I have not read it carefully; & only once; & it is very obscure; so no doubt I have scamped the virtue of it more than is fair. I feel that myriads of tiny bullets pepper one & spatter one; but one does not get one deadly wound straight in the face—as from Tolstoy, for instance; but it is entirely absurd to compare him with Tolstoy."
1922.09.07,"Having written this, L. put into my hands a very intelligent review of Ulysses, in the American Nation; which, for the first time, analyses the meaning; & certainly makes it very much more impressive than I judged. Still I think there is virtue & some lasting truth in first impressions; so I don’t cancell mine. I must read some of the chapters again. Probably the final beauty of writing is never felt by contemporaries; but they ought, I think, to be bowled over; & this I was not. Then again, I had my back up on purpose; then again I was over stimulated by Tom’s praises.

We are having 3 fine days, & may even have 4 or 5. The garden is at its finest: the big bed spread with brilliant flowers, their petals almost touching. Henry Dedman has weeded the paths. At 7.30 on a fine night they have a phosp⁠[h]⁠orescent look, gleaming out. But it gets too cold for night wandering, & alas, I rather regret sharing my fire, & relinquishing my arm chair tonight, for the Sangers are coming. The three of them stalk in: Dora at least stumps. And though I like youth in the beginning, poor Daphne is a bit of a lump, & they fuss over her unnecessarily, & she shakes us all off, puzzled, exasperated, but not very good company, poor wretch."
1922.09.08,"When Mrs Woolf was here, she said she had been asked several times at Philip’s wedding the meaning of the word honeymoon—Mr Sturgeon has now supplied it. What things people say at weddings! She said, Again I’m a wanderer on the earth. If I could find someone to go with me, I’d buy a caravan. Now having had 10 children I am to live in 2 rooms in South Kensington. Leonard cant drink milk with the skin on. None of his family can. “I could see it in Mrs Woolf’s eyes” said Lottie—a wonderful piece of psychology. Flora told me that they eat funguses in Sweden; which grow there in great quantities. They eat all except the red funguses. She found a green one & threw it away. It was one of the best. Mrs W. said that Sweden is a great knife & fork country. They think too much about eating she said. Each of these sayings seemed to me very significant at the time; though I daresay I shant be able to see why.

The Sangers came last night. Charlie’s views on literature are oddly cut & dry to me. He discoursed upon languages, Latin & German: I know not why it is that people who aren’t writers always give one a dry bone in one’s hand, however much they may know. He has a very low opinion of Proust, but thinks that you cant write a psychological novel in French. From French he hops to Latin, to German, to Russian: but the perches are dry."
1922.09.12,"Lytton drove off an hour ago; & I have been sitting here, unable to read or collect myself—such is the wreckage dealt by 4 days of conversation. We had the Sangers once, & Shanks last night, so we lashed our tongues lavishly. A bitter wind blew splinters of sunshine. On Sunday it poured—as it has now once more started to do.

I told Lytton I should try to write down his talk—which sprang from a conversation about Boswell. But said Lytton, I never do talk. But you are witty, so they say, I replied. Lytton had of course read Mrs Thrale. And then we talked about Gibbon, whose method of dealing with the approach of the barbarian is quite magnificent. One night he gave us a complete account of the prison system, based on reports which he has been reading—thoroughly, with mastery, & a kind of political ability which impresses me. He would have been an admirable ruler of an Indian province. However, as usual, there was one main theme to which we returned—Ralph & Carrington. There are two questions to be settled—R. & V⁠[alentine]. D⁠[obree]. (who is settled in London) & R. & his livelihood. Both weigh upon poor old Lytton who feels himself in the position of a father, is slightly in love, yet sees, with his usual candour, all the faults & drawbacks. Ralph, too, lays the responsibility much on him—for the Hogarth Press that is—he refuses to discuss his love affairs, & Lytton sees, apprehensive & cautious as he is, how easily one might take the wrong line, & break off all communications. And so we discussed possible plans—that they should buy Suffield; that we should move into 38 Brunswick Square; that R. should be set up in a farm; that they should live in Boulogne, so that Lytton might write indecently. Perhaps Lytton was depressed. But we said scarcely anything of ‘our writing’. Not a compliment passed. I daresay this is a healthier atmosphere than the other—it is not quite so pleasant.

Then Shanks came in last night—a snub nosed putty faced shapeless little man—entirely lacking in temperament, according to Lytton—who was very silent. We chattered reviewers shop; & could not leave those rails. He tells me that the Lit. Sup. is not paying any of its contributors. Jack Squire, he said, is becoming stiff with morality. “Thats a pretty girl,” says someone in the street, whereupon Jack blushes scarlet. Indeed, Shanks says that he left the London M⁠[ercury]. because Squire refused to review Ulysses (wh. I have lent Shanks). No doubt Mrs Shanks & Miss Hawkesford somehow came in. But I gathered that Shanks does not take Squire quite so seriously as we had thought. However, I doubt that we shall get much further with a man with a boneless mind. He said he would give me mulberries. Nobody could feel sure what he thought of his evening."
1922.09.26,"A great many things have happened, unrecorded. This has been the most sociable summer we’ve ever had. Sometimes I feel as if, instead of sleeping through the months in a dark room, I’d been up in the light all night. Clive & Mary came; Mary in grey silk stockings; couldn’t jump a ditch; was very affable; said she liked long walks; sat on the floor; praised Clive; & half invited me to Wittering. Morgan came on Friday; Tom on Saturday. My talk with Tom deserves writing down, but won’t get it for the light is fading; & one cannot write talk down either, as was agreed at Charleston the other day.

There was a good deal of talk about Ulysses. Tom said “He is a purely literary writer. He is founded upon Walter Pater with a dash of Newman.” I said he was virile—a he-goat; but didn’t expect Tom to agree. Tom did tho’; & said he left out many things that were important. The book would be a landmark, because it destroyed the whole of the 19th Century. It left Joyce himself with nothing to write another book on. It showed up the futility of all the English styles. He thought some of the writing beautiful. But there was no ‘great conception’: that was not Joyce’s intention. He thought that Joyce did completely what he meant to do. But he did not think that he gave a new insight into human nature—said nothing new like Tolstoi. Bloom told one nothing. Indeed, he said, this new method of giving the psychology proves to my mind that it doesn’t work. It doesn’t tell as much as some casual glance from outside often tells. I said I had found [Thackeray’s] Pendennis more illuminating in this way. (The horses are now cropping near my window; the little owl calling; & so I write nonsense.)

So we got on to S. Sitwell who merely explores his sensibility—one of the deadly crimes as Tom thinks: to Dostoevsky—the ruin of English literature, we agreed; Synge a fake: present state disastrous, because the form don’t fit; to his mind not even promising well; he said that one must now be a very first rate poet to be a poet at all: when there were great poets, the little ones caught some of the glow, & were not worthless. Now there’s no great poet. When was the last? I asked; & he said none that interested him since the time of Johnson. Browning he said was lazy: they are all lazy he said. And Macaulay spoilt English prose. We agreed that people are now afraid of the English language. He said it came of being bookish, but not reading books enough. One should read all styles thoroughly. He thought D H Lawrence came off occasionally, especially in Aaron’s Rod, the last book; had great moments; but was a most incompetent writer. He could cling tight to his conviction though. (Light now fails—7.10. after a bad rainy day.)"
1922.09.27,"An epoch making conversation is now going on within earshot. I think the Dedmans may be going, & Dedman saying so to L. But to return. While Tom & I talked in the drawing room, Morgan wrote an article up here; or flitted through; humble, deprecating, chubby like a child; but very observant. Tom’s head is all breadth & bone compared with Morgan’s. He still remains something of the schoolmaster, but I am not sure that he does not paint his lips. After Joyce, however, we came to ticklish matters—the Eliot fund; the upshot of it was (& we were elliptical, tactful, nervous) that Tom won’t leave the Bank under £500, & must have securities—not pledges. So next morning, when Ott’s letter & circular arrived, aiming at £300, on a 5 year basis of pledges, I had to wire her to stop, & then to draft a long letter giving my reasons; & another to Tom, asking him to confirm my information. I shall be scalded in two separate baths of hot water no doubt. But this can wait.

For the rest the week end was chilly & stormy. We had one blow on the hills. Tom left before dinner. Then we snuggled in, & Morgan became very familiar; anecdotic; simple, gossiping about friends & humming his little tunes; Tom asked him to contribute to the Criterion. I was impressed by his complete modesty (founded perhaps on considerable self assurance). Compliments scarcely touch him. He is happy in his novel, but does not want to discuss it. There is something too simple about him—for a writer perhaps, mystic, silly, but with a childs insight: oh yes, & something manly & definite too. He had been staying with Hardy, who is given up to vanities & attends punctiliously to reviewers. He complained of the Spectator; which was hostile he said, because he knew Lytton; & the cousins had quarrelled. Then to his pets burial ground; & some story about cats killed on the railway line—Poor old Hardy is perfectly ordinary, nice, conventional, never says a clever thing; says commonplaces about his books; has tea at the rectory; is very healthy; objects to American visitors; & never mentions literature. How am I to dress this for the Obituary?"
1922.10.04,"Our last whole day. From the weather point of view, the summer has been altogether disappointing. It has promised & then withheld. We have not had 7 consecutive good days. There has been a scattering of good ones, but in the midst of rain, wind, & dark London looking skies. Often the Roman road was so muddy I could not walk along it. And often I heard the thunder murmuring as I walked. Grizzel was frightened & ran home—as if God would go out of his way to hurt a mongrel fox terrier walking on the flats at Rodmell! But there’s no arguing about these things. I think the garden has never been better, & we have had good crops of apples & pears, & green peas only 2 days ago.

Spiritually speaking we have made some progress in Rodmell society. I was struck by the bloodlessness of philistines the other day at the Rectory. They seem far less alive than we intellectuals. Mr Shanks & the Hoggs [unidentified] are, after all, so pale, so watery, so mild. Mrs Hawkesford still discusses the country & London; says, for the 20th time, that she is so glad she kept the tennis court going, even though they turned the pony on it during the war. Boen sits lackadaisical, & helps me to Shanks’ cigarettes. Then I don’t like underbred young men—Hogg to wit. They seem to me a little peevish & conventional; & talk slang which covers any character they may have.

I am a little uppish, though, & self assertive, because Brace wrote to me yesterday “We think Jacob’s Room an extraordinarily distinguished & beautiful work. You have, of course, your own method, & it is not easy to foretell how many readers it will have; surely it will have enthusiastic ones, & we delight in publishing it”—or words to that effect. As this is my first testimony from an impartial person I am pleased. For one thing it must make some impression, as a whole; & cannot be wholly frigid fireworks. We think of publishing on Oct. 27th. I daresay Duckworth is a little cross with me. I snuff my freedom. It is I think true, soberly & not artificially for the public, that I shall go on unconcernedly whatever people say. At last, I like reading my own writing. It seems to me to fit me closer than it did before. I have done my task here better than I expected. Mrs Dalloway & the Chaucer chapter are finished; I have read 5 books of the Odyssey; Ulysses; & now begin Proust. I also read Chaucer & the Pastons. So evidently my plan of the two books running side by side is practicable, & certainly I enjoy my reading with a purpose. I am committed to only one Supt. article—on Essays—& that at my own time; so I am free. I shall read Greek now steadily & begin ‘The Prime Minister’ on Friday morning. I shall read the Trilogy & some Sophocles & Euripides & a Plato dialogue: also the lives of Bentley & Jebb. At forty I am beginning to learn the mechanism of my own brain—how to get the greatest amount of pleasure & work out of it. The secret is I think always so to contrive that work is pleasant."
1922.10.08,"Back again, over the fire at Hogarth House, having read the first chapters of Bentley. Grizzel sits on L.’s knee. Boxall—the kitten, called after Nelly to ingratiate her, is happily off mine; temporarily, or I could not write.

But the day has been spoilt for me—so strangely—by Kitty Maxse’s death; & now I think of her lying in her grave at Gunby, & Leo going home, & all the rest. I read it in the paper. I hadn’t seen her since, I guess, 1908—save at old Davies’ funeral, & then I cut her, which now troubles me—unreasonably I suppose. I could not have kept up with her; she never tried to see me. Yet yet—these old friends dying without any notice on our part always—it begins to happen often—saddens me: makes me feel guilty. I wish I’d met her in the street. My mind has gone back all day to her; in the queer way it does. First thinking out how she died, suddenly at 33 Cromwell Road; she was always afraid of operations. Then visualising her—her white hair—pink cheeks—how she sat upright—her voice—with its characteristic tones—her green blue floor—which she painted with her own hands: her earrings, her gaiety, yet melancholy; her smartness: her tears, which stayed on her cheek. Not that I ever felt at my ease with her. But she was very charming—very humorous. She got engaged at St Ives, & Thoby thought it was Paddy talking to his boy. They sat on the seat by the greenhouse in the Love Corner. However, I keep going over this very day in my mind."
1922.10.14,"I was interrupted in this, & now Kitty is buried & mourned by half the grandees in London; & here I am thinking of my book. Kitty fell, very mysteriously, over some bannisters. Shall I ever walk again? she said to Leo. And to the Dr “I shall never forgive myself for my carelessness”. How did it happen? Some one presumably knows, & in time I shall hear. Nessa regrets her, but says that the breach came through Kitty. “It seems rather melancholy that it should come to an end like this” Nessa said; but she was putting Angelica to bed, & we could not dig in our past.

I have seen Nessa, Maynard, Lydia, Desmond, Saxon, Lytton, Frankie Birrell & Marjorie Fry, all within this week; & had two letters, from Lytton & Carrington, about Jacob’s Room, & written I don’t know how many envelopes; & here we are on the verge of publication. I must sit for my portrait to John o’London’s on Monday. Richmond writes to ask that date of publication may be put ahead, so that they may notice it on Thursday. My sensations?—they remain calm. Yet how could Lytton have praised me more highly? prophecies immortality for it as poetry, is afraid of my romance; but the beauty of the writing &c. Lytton praises me too highly for it to give me exquisite pleasure; or perhaps that nerve grows dulled. I want to be through the splash & swimming in calm water again. I want to be writing unobserved. Mrs Dalloway has branched into a book; & I adumbrate here a study of insanity & suicide: the world seen by the sane & the insane side by side—something like that. Septimus Smith?—is that a good name?—& to be more close to the fact than Jacob: but I think Jacob was a necessary step, for me, in working free. And now I must use this benignant page for making out a scheme of work.

I must get on with my reading for the Greek chapter. I shall finish the Prime Minister in another week—say 21st. Then I must be ready to start my Essay article for the Times: say on the 23rd. That will take say till 2nd Nov. Therefore I must now concentrate on Essays: with some Aeschylus. & I think begin Zimmern, making rather a hasty end of Bentley, who is not really much to my purpose. I think that clears the matter up—though how to read Aeschylus, I don’t quite know: quickly, is my desire, but that, I see, is an illusion.

Our great interview with Lytton as to Ralph came off on Thursday. Lytton was extremely adroit, & made points which Ralph prompt⁠[l]⁠y gave away. For Ralph will stay on any terms. Lytton proposes that we should give him complete business control; but this is coupled with his decision on no account to increase his hours of work. I’m rather in the mood to say that I won’t give serious books to a manager who wont give up his chicken breeding to look after them. And then how far could L. stand & watch Ralph’s howlers? And lunch & tea with Ralph for ever? And Whitall? This accumulates. We are to go to Tidmarsh after the rush is over & excogitate. As for my views about the success of Jacob, what are they? I think we shall sell 500: it will then go on slowly, & reach 800 by June. It will be highly praised in some places for ‘beauty’; will be crabbed by people who want human character. The only review I am anxious about is the one in the Supt.: not that it will be the most intelligent, but it will be the most read & I cant bear people to see me downed in public. The W⁠[estminster]. G⁠[azette]. will be hostile; so, very likely, the Nation. But I am perfectly serious in saying that nothing budges me from my determination to go on, or alters my pleasure, so whatever happens, though the surface may be agitated, the centre is secure."
1922.10.17,"As this is to be a chart of my progress I enter hastily here, one, a letter from Desmond who is halfway through: says “You have never written so well … I marvel & am puzzled”—or words to that effect: (2 Bunny rings up enthusiastic, says it is superb, far my best, has great vitality & importance: also he takes 36 copies, & says people already ‘clamour’. This is not confirmed by the bookshops, visited by Ralph Those sold under 50 today; but the libraries remain, & Simpkin Marshall"
1922.10.29,"Miss Mary Butts being gone, & my head too stupid for reading, may as well write here, for my amusement later perhaps. I mean I’m too riddled with talk & harassed with the usual worry of people who like & people who don’t like J.R. to concentrate. There was the Time review on Thursday—long, a little tepid, I think; saying that one can’t make characters in this way; flattering enough. Of course, I had a letter from Morgan in the opposite sense—the letter I’ve liked best of all. We have sold 650, I think; & have ordered a second edition. My sensations?—as usual—mixed. I shall never write a book that is an entire success. This time the reviews are against me, & the private people enthusiastic. Either I am a great writer or a nincompoop. “An elderly sensualist” the Daily News calls me. Pall Mall passes me over as negligible. I expect to be neglected & sneered at. And what will be the fate of our second thousand then? So far of course, the success is much more than we expected. I think I am better pleased so far than I have ever been Morgan, Lytton, Bunny, Violet, Logan, Philip, have all written enthusiastically. But I want to be quit of all this. It hangs about me like Mary Butts’ scent. I dont want to be totting up compliments, & comparing reviews. I want to think out Mrs Dalloway. I want to foresee this book better than the others, & get the utmost out of it. I expect I could have screwed Jacob up tighter if I had foreseen; but I had to make my path as I went.

One of the perquisities of Jacob seems to be society. I am going to Ly Colefax on Tuesday to hear Valery lecture: also to Miss Sands. They are all now (momentarily, through Logan I daresay) on my side. And at the moment I feel inclined for a plunge, though it must be on my own terms: in my own clothes, & at my own hours. I can’t go in to Whitall’s visit at length. But our position becomes more & more complicated. Clearly we cannot go on publishing seriously with Ralph attached to us like a drone. Whitall is a greyhound looking nervous American, serious, matter of fact, forced to make money. How far do we want to make money with him? At anyrate the labour & worry of getting out a long book makes me decided not to do it again on the present system. We have to go to Tidmarsh next week to explain the position. Carrington says that Lytton is most anxious for some arrangement, & the uncertainty is trying Ralph’s nerves. Yet this nervous man makes no attempt to do the most ordinary things for us. L. has to tie parcels every morning. Ralph catches no earlier or later trains. Thursday morning he spent at the tailor’s. But there is the American element in Whitall to be distrusted—in short it bothers us, & the election is beginning to roar in the newspapers. L. has a chance of getting in. We have bitten off a large piece of life—but why not? Did I not make out a philosophy some time ago which comes to this—that one must always be on the move?"
1922.11.07,"I am, probably, through the splash, & must really try to settle in again. It has not been, publicly, much of a splash. The reviews have said more against me than for me—on the whole. Its so odd how little I mind—& odd how little I care much that Clive thinks it a masterpiece. Yet the private praise has been the most whole hearted I’ve yet had. They seem to agree that I have accomplished what in the other books I only got near accomplishing. But we scarcely sell, though it has been out 10 days. Nor do I much mind that—What do I mind then? I want to grapple with the 10th of June, or whatever I call it. Meanwhile, to keep me unsettled I get invited out. We went to Logan’s last week, & there met Percy Lubbock after 12 years. I sat next him at the Smiths the night Lytton proposed to me. I remember I saw a red azalea fountain in the middle of the dinner table; but not much else. Lady Grose [unidentified] was late; Percy pale. Percy is still pale, but mild & elderly. I was reassured by his shabby boots. He is a slow kind melancholy man; I run round him, & plant darts in his flanks, & we are to ask him to dinner. Then there was Mrs Hammersley remembering my father & the Duckworths, & I’m to go to her; & to Ethel Sands; & to the Oriental Club to lunch with Lytton. We had a stormy week end at Tidmarsh, & I’m afraid I have concluded that Ralph must go. His jealousy, & irrationality, combined with his fixed determination to make a permanent hobby out of what’s a profession to us, make the position less & less possible. Yet I am sorry, & like him, & the association. On the other hand what fun to spring off & make a good job of it! Suppose one could get a young man or woman of wits who would work violently & rashly.

Last night I dined for the first time with Clive in his rooms. Now I must make up my work account, for I have no time to say how strange that dinner was with Nessa & Clive again as we used to be so often; now a little formal superficially, & yet, miraculously, still intimate beneath: all 40 & over; all prosperous; & my book (that I felt somehow pleasing) acclaimed by Nessa “certainly a work of genius”. Lytton came in later, which made it yet stranger; & there we sat, with H⁠[arcourt]. Brace’s catalogue talking of us all by name as the most brilliant group in Gordon Square! Fame, you see.

I shall polish off my Essay article tomorrow, Wed. 8th. Then I think I shall try to sketch out Mrs D. & consult L. & write the aeroplane chapter now, for I must write out of my head again. A fortnight’s criticism is my stint. So if that takes a week, or 10 days, & brings me to 18th Nov. I must be ready to start the Greek chapter say on the 20th; only I have not read half or a 20th part, owing to interruptions. So I incline to writing that chapter in bits. First introduction & Bentley: then Odyssey: then on to Aeschylus, reading furiously the while. It is terribly easy to let the reading slip; so I must make an effort to get 2 hours either before dinner or after, & must now write to Will A.F. & refuse to go there, since I am out daily till Saturday. But oh the question of Ralph! & now I have a pressing appeal from Carrington."
1922.11.13,"And I lost my temper with Ralph, over Constable’s offer. For things are moving briskly this autumn, & Logan took me aside at Ethel Sands’ (same setting, same company, same sayings, doings & feelings) in order to negotiate an arrangement between us & Constable, who has a room to let, & wants us to combine. Ralph is jealous as a sore bear; obstructs every proposal with trumped up arguments, designed to protect his own skin, & not English literature, as he rashly makes out, & thus requires correction at my hands. We have not advertised this week owing to [the] Election, & sell slowly. Reviews are now favourable & utterly contradictory, as usual. I am quite able to write away without bother from self-consciousness, now; which shows that my splash is over. On the whole, I am perfectly satisfied, though; more so, I think, than ever before. And now I have a multitude of pleasant jobs on hand, & am really very busy, & very happy, & only want to say Time, stand still here; which is not a thing that many women in Richmond could say I think. Nessa & I are collaborating over a paper for covers which she has designed, & I am to colour. We went to the Beggars Opera the other night, L. being at Liverpool. That is the only move he is to make. But his address seems to give satisfaction, & I doubt not he could get in if he chose—next time if not this. America wishes him to write a monthly article—New York Times that is; which increases our income, & proves him at the tree top. People write little articles about him, saying he is selfless in his work for the public, & the most brilliant of our writers, & leaders of the younger school. I like this, & forgive Massingham his abuse of me from this time forward. L. is now writing his weekly article, on Turkey, having been up to see Massingham, found a pea soup [sic] in London. I walked in the Park, bought 2 wild duck & 6 snipe, all fresh & bleeding, just shot at Beaconsfield by 2 poachers I suspect. I paid 8/6, thus introducing a good deal of stir in Hogarth House kitchen. And now I must try to make out what Aeschylus wrote."
1922.11.27,"I need not say that my wild duck stank like old sea weed & had to be buried. But I cannot dally over this incident, which in tamer days might have provided some fun, because I have such a congeries of affairs to relate, & have to steal time from the Agamemnon. There is the Press to be chronicled. We had to meet Whitall at the Club, to discuss the Heinemann offer; & waiting there, we overheard one of those usual shabby, loose, cropheaded, small faced bright eyed young women, who was leaning negligently over the sofa side, & chatting with Scott as he drank tea, tell him that she was tired of teaching & meant to become a printer. “They say there’s never been a woman printer; but I mean to be one. No I know nothing whatever about it … &c.” When she went into the writing room, I followed, plucked her out, & revealed us to her as proprietors of the Hogarth Press. Yesterday she & “a friend” came to tea. This friend we called mistakenly Jones; he being Joad, of the 1917 Club; a philosopher; a sturdy short man, with very bright round eyes, hair touched with grey, cocksure, reposing much weight upon the sterling quality of his intellect, & thus dispensing with the graces & amenities, as usual with sterling young men. He tipped one of my chairs on two legs, & ate a large tea, keeping close watch over Marjorie’s interests at every point. For it was evident that she was ready to bind herself hand & foot to us, & make fantastic promises. Still, she has been thoroughly educated, must earn her living, & has written, Joad says, a first rate novel. Well its not quite written, she said; being of course, far more modest & less self confident & more excitable than Cyril. “We are going to be married in February” she said, when we came up here from the scullery. And I mean to go on working after I’m married. She now teaches at a Girls School in Gordon Square. And what does it all amount to? I should say she is 25 or 6: quick, impulsive, but with a steel thread in her from earning & learning, which is an invaluable property, & one that gives an edge to the rest. In short she might take us on & make a life work of it. Since heaven dropped the seed into her naturally, she will want no urging, & will cleave to it as to her own flesh & bone, I can see. Joad, who detests my books & adores the work of Beresford & sticks his little horns manfully into facts, may be an obstacle; since he may try to impose his literary views upon us; & I imagine him one of the steely intellectuals who treat literature as though it were an ingenious picture puzzle, to be fitted accurately together. But I dont know. Moreover, we both liked him, & her too (but she was less self assertive, passed the cake, praised the dog, & sensitively appraised the situation with antennae quivering, woman like). We all kept our heads very creditably, insisted upon strict business dealings, & are to meet again on Sunday week. But where then does Ralph come in? He looks a little glum, & says very little. I fancy our teas & lunches are a little strained. Tomorrow we interview Heinemann at his office, but I don’t think much will come from that.

Jacob has now sold 850 copies, & the second edition wont come much before it is needed I hope. People—my friends I mean—seem agreed that it is my masterpiece, & the starting point for fresh adventures. Last night we dined with Roger & I was praised whole-heartedly by him, for the first time; only he wishes that a bronze body might somehow solidify beneath the gleams & lights—with which I agree. He has been cured, so he says, by Coué; but seemed old to me. The approaching marriage of Pam, which drains upon his paternal feelings generally not shown, depresses him, & puts the stress on a side of him which is private & difficult, for, as he has always kept clear of fatherly responsibilities, he is now shy of them; cant deny his feelings for her; but cannot exercise his rights—to forbid the marriage. Oh how cold it was coming home in the train!"
1922.12.03,"I should be at Aeschylus, for I am making a complete edition, text, translation, & notes of my own—mostly copied from Verrall; but carefully gone into by me. But these are historic days. The Hogarth Press is in travail. Heinemanns made us a most flattering offer—to the effect that we should give us [sic] our brains & blood, & they would see to sales & ledgers. But we sniff patronage. If they gain, we lose. Our name has to be coupled with theirs. In the opinions of Desmond, Clive, Roger & I think Vanessa, the exchange would be capitulation. We are both very willing to come to this conclusion, & have decided for freedom & a fight with great private glee. This brought on an argument with Ralph last Friday. We must have a whole timer in January, or close down partially. After some demur, he brought forth a plan obviously concocted at Tidmarsh, by which we are to become a company, with Noel C⁠[arrington]. for London manager, Lytton, L. & I for partners, with Ralph remaining as he is. Lytton is said to hint a possibility that we should have all his work. At first tempting, this plan becomes to us less & less feasible; considering that we should have to keep N.C. in work, be ready to tackle an enormous commercial success, & fall more & more, so we suspect, into readers & advisers to the firm of Partridge & Carrington, who would become by force of circumstances, commercial mainly with only a dab of Hogarth gold left on top. At this moment we incline to Miss Tomson & freedom. Let P. & Carrington start their own press, & go ahead for ourselves, gradually branching as opportunity occurs. One is much attracted by the idea of a keen worker; & to tell the truth, Noel did not give either of us the desire to strive for him. Why, after all, should we conciliate Ralph? And is it not better to end this perpetual strain of friendship’s burden—hurting Lytton’s feelings that is, by failing to consider how fast poor R.’s heart beats after a conversation with us? Such, in short, are the reasons which come to the front; & we have to refuse to talk Hogarth matters, for the discussion is endless. Tomorrow, Ralph is going to lay before us a definite proposal on the part of Lytton.

But there is serious reason, & not mere restlessness, in our need for re-organisation. We are both giving all our spare time, & still there is far more work than we can do. Jacob has sold, I think, 850; with review copies 950; there is an ominous slackening of Simkin’s orders this last week, which shows, perhaps, that the rush is over. But we shall broach our second edition, & shall not lose, even if we sell no more, more than £10; so I am satisfied. But the books press. There are now Miss Hobhouse’s diary, & Stephen Reynolds’ letters to be read & considered, & at this rate, we have work for not 3 people but 4 or 5 or 6.

This autumn has been perhaps the busiest of my dilatory life. People & books—I sing that to the tune of Woman & Wine, which comes in the Beggars Opera. I dined with Mary on Friday, met Clive & Aldous; Aldous very long, rather puffy, fat faced, white, with very thick hair, & canary coloured socks, is the raconteur; the young man of letters who sees life. We all said we despised reviewers & told little stories to our own advantage. Both the gentlemen had been complimented by Max—but not the lady. At first one thinks the"
1922.12.15,"I forget what I was to say, & only write this now as I have 15 minutes before my solitary dinner, L. dining with Sangers, after a terrific Hogarth Press discussion ending in the final parting with Ralph. It was a question of the terms upon which the Tidmarsh Press (he was to run one in conjunction with us) was to have. He stood out for one third. Finally we agreed; but the discussion raised our backs, & so—(Nell said that orange was bad—everything goes through—Lottie’s conversation is running while I write). I am too muzzy headed to make out anything. This is partly the result of dining to meet the lovely gifted aristocratic Sackville West last night at Clive’s. Not much to my severer taste—florid, moustached, parakeet coloured, with all the supple ease of the aristocracy, but not the wit of the artist. She writes 15 pages a day—has finished another book—publishes with Heinemanns—knows everyone—But could I ever know her? I am to dine there on Tuesday.

Waiting for L., I will continue. Half past ten just struck on one of these fine December nights, which come after sunny days, & I don’t know why, keep sending through me such shocks from my childhood. Am I growing old & sentimental? I keep thinking of sounds I heard as a child—at St Ives mostly.

The aristocratic manner is something like the actresses—no false shyness or modesty: a bead dropped into her plate at dinner—given to Clive—asks for liqueur—has her hand on all the ropes—makes me feel virgin, shy, & schoolgirlish. Yet after dinner I rapped out opinions. She is a grenadier; hard; handsome, manly; inclined to double chin. Dear old Desmond moped like a tipsy owl in his corner, affectionate & glad to talk to me, I think. He said something about the French admiring Jacob, & wishing to translate it. I go on getting letters, & reap more praise than ever before. Sales sluggish though. Not yet 1000. But I don’t mind.

As for Ralph—that question certainly cant be settled before L. comes in. Why did he make me, & L., so furious by saying, in his sulky schoolboy voice, that if this crisis hadn’t happened, he would have had a nice surprise to offer us at Easter?—something of Lytton’s presumably? I think the kernel of our discontent lies in that sentence—the bully, the swagger, the bribe offered us by Lytton, through this gawkish boor, & his simple rustic faith that writing by Lytton must solve all difficulties instead of which it complicates things.

So far as I can see, Ralph’s disappearance would leave us more freedom, but give us more work. We should have to make further arrangements. But the basis would be sound, which is the great thing. If we keep Ralph, there will be constant disease. He hinted that he wished to be able to break. Again, the question of borrowing money from Lytton always recurs: & the obvious pressure they make to consolidate their position. This would be perfect if Ralph were not Ralph. I see him rigid & ossified in middle age; repeating more & more accurately his lesson learnt from Lytton. And though I would give a good deal to combine with Lytton in producing literature, there is little to be got from him save his own works. I mean, I think by our own merits now we attract all the young."
1923.01.02,"If I were a dissembler I should date this the last day of 1922. So it is to all intents. We came back from Rodmell yesterday, & I am in one of my moods, as the nurses used to call it, today. And what is it & why? A desire for children, I suppose; for Nessa’s life; for the sense of flowers breaking all round me involuntarily. Here’s Angelica—here’s Quentin & Julian. Now children dont make yourself ill on plum pudding tonight. We have people dining. There’s no hot water. The gas is escaping in Quentin’s bedroom—I pluck what I call flowers at random. They make my life seem a little bare sometimes; & then my inveterate romanticism suggests an image of forging ahead, alone, through the night: of suffering inwardly, stoically; of blazing my way through to the end—& so forth. The truth is that the sails flap about me for a day or two on coming back; & not being at full stretch I ponder & loiter. And it is all temporary: yet let me be quite clear about that. Let me have one confessional where I need not boast. Years & years ago, after the Lytton affair, I said to myself, walking up the hill at Beireuth, never pretend that the things you haven’t got are not worth having; good advice I think. At least it often comes back to me. Never pretend that children, for instance, can be replaced by other things. And then I went on (the thought is always connected with Mrs Freshfield—why?) to say to myself that one must (put all one’s weight upon) (how am I to convey it?) like things for themselves: or rather, rid them of their bearing upon one’s personal life. One must throw that aside; & venture on to the things that exist independently of oneself. Now this is very hard for young women to do. Yet I got satisfaction from it. And now, married to L., I never have to make the effort. I do it, if I enjoy doing it. Perhaps I have been too happy for my soul’s good? Perhaps I have become cowardly & self-indulgent? And does some of my discontent come from feeling that? I could not stay at 46 last night, because L. on the telephone expressed displeasure. Late again. Very foolish. Your heart bad—& so my self reliance being sapped, I had no courage to venture against his will. Then I react. Of course its a difficult question. For undoubtedly I get headaches or the jump in my heart; & then this spoils his pleasure, & if one lives with a person, has one the right—So it goes on. And I will try to make up my accounts on the spiritual side before attacking the temporal, only, as usual, jerkily, disconnectedly, & without more than the sort of tap a chemist might give to the jars in his shop, naming them shortly, because he knows what is in them. At fifty, when I re-read, perhaps I shall know what I meant.

Middle Age then. Let that be the text of my discourse. I’m afraid we’re becoming elderly. We are busy & attach importance to hours. I have my correspondence to finish, says L. today. I don’t laugh. I take it seriously. But we must not let our hobbies & pleasures become objects of fetish worship. L., I think, suffers from his extreme clarity. He sees things so clear that he can’t swim float & speculate. And now we have such a train attached to us that we have to go on. It is easy, at least, to pretend that pressure is upon us. Nessa, though, who might so easily plead ties & circumstances, rides much more freely than we do. She will spend Easter travelling with the children, for instance. We have to make money—that is true. We have to have a house; 2 houses; 2 servants; a press; a Tomson; a Ralph. Yet most of this is for my sake; & am I honest in wishing it otherwise? Dont I feel (mainly) that I must ease the strain of circumstances in order to write?—that interruptions bore me: put gross matter in my fire?

I will leave it here, unfinished, a note of interrogation—signifying some mood that recurs, but is not often expressed. One’s life is made up, superficially, of such moods; but they cross a solid substance, which too I am not going to hack my way into now.

So this is the end of 1922.

[DIARY XII]"
1923.01.07,"Let the scene open on the doorstep of number 50 Gordon Square. We went up last night, carrying our bags, & a Ceylonese sword. There was Mary H. in lemon coloured trousers with green ribbons. & so we sat down to dinner; off cold chicken. In came Roger & Adrian & Karin; & very slowly we coloured our faces & made ready for number 46. It was the proudest moment of Clive’s life when he led Mary on one arm, Virginia on the other, into the drawing room, which was full, miscellaneous; & oriental for the most part. Suppose one’s normal pulse to be 70: in five minutes it was 120: & the blood, not the sticky whitish fluid of daytime, but brilliant & prickling like champagne. This was my state, & most peoples. We collided, when we met: went pop, used Christian names, flattered, praised, & thought (or I did) of Shakespeare. At any rate I thought of him when the singing was doing—Sh⁠[akespear]⁠e I thought would have liked us all tonight. Not that Bobo was other than a damp owl, with some private gloom which being too personal for my taste, she brought with her. Then there was a plain woodfaced Darwin—which? And Hussey, like a Victorian seamstress by a table covered in mohair checks. My luck was in though, & I found good quarters with Frankie & Sheppard & Bunny, & Lydia—all my friends in short. But what we talked about I hardly know. Bunny asked me to be his childs godmother. And a Belgian wants to translate me. Arnold Bennett thinks me wonderful &—&—(these, no doubt were elements in my hilarity). Gumbo distorted nursery rhymes; Lydia danced; there were charades; Sickert acted Hamlet. We were all easy & gifted & friendly & like good children rewarded by having the capacity for enjoying ourselves thus. Could our fathers? I, wearing my mothers laces, looked at Mary’s little soft Jerboa face in the old looking glass—& wondered.

I daresay no one said anything very brilliant. I sat by Sickert, & liked him, talking in his very workmanlike, but not at all society manner, of painting, & Whistler; of an operation he saw at Dieppe. But can life be worth so much pain, he asked? “Pour respirer” said the Dr. That is enough. But for two years ‘after my wife’s death’ I did not wish to live said Sickert. There is something indescribably congenial to me in this easy artists talk; the values the same as my own & therefore right; no impediments; life charming, good & interesting; no effort; art brooding calmly over it all; & none of this attachment to mundane things, which I find in Chelsea. For Sickert said, why should one be attached to one’s own body & breakfast? Why not be satisfied to let others have the use of ones life, & live it over again, being dead oneself? No mysticism, & therefore a great relish for the actual things—whatever they may be—old plays, girls, boys, Proust, Handel sung by Oliver [Strachey]; the turn of a head & so on.

As parties do, this one began to dwindle, until a few persistent talkers were left by themselves sitting in such odd positions—Oliver full length by Barbara on the floor; Ralph astride a chair in the middle of the room; Lytton & I side by side on the sofa.

“And what do you think of the Tidmarsh Press”, said Lytton.

And this was his craftly way of telling me that Ralph means to set up on his own, or rather on his own after the Hogarth model after easter. Lytton was anxious to sound me. Should we think it poaching? For it would be exactly the same as the Hogarth Press. I said I should say sharp things, but there was quite enough work for two. In the middle of the night of course I blazed up & abused Ralph for a pickpocket (myself to myself that is). But Lytton was not altogether urbane. He is possessive. His baby shall have his toy, & he shan’t share it with anyone else this time. Well—so be it. The immediate effect is to make L. & me set to—wire in as Nelly would say—& bestir ourselves for the future. We wont be downed by the prestige & power & pomposity of all the Benson medallists in England. In fact, the struggle is invigorating; though it does not improve our opinion of the ass. I especially dislike his effect upon Lytton. Lytton becomes jealous, & suspicious, & uses his wits to make the worse appear the better cause. Love is the devil. No character can stand up against it. But this passed in our trivial champagne pricking way. And so, at 3, I suppose, back to no. 50 to which Clive had gone previously.

I went up & found the light burning & so turned it out. I noticed a bluish glimmer under Clive’s door. “Reading in bed,” I thought, & hoped I should not be called in to talk. But the house was too noisy for me to sleep. People seemed to be walking. Then a woman cried, as if in anguish, in the street, & I thought of Mrs Thompson waiting to be executed. I turned about. Footsteps sounded. A door opened. I heard voices. At this hour, I thought innocently, no one can be up without cause—illness or accident. So up I jumped, thrust in my upper teeth, & opened the door.

“Is something wrong?” I asked of Clive’s shadow on his bedroom wall, for his door was open.

“I hope I’ve not waked you”, he said.

Obviously nothing was wrong. The shriek was Mary’s.

And so we breakfasted together this morning, with the church bells ringing, & all the houses full of Stracheys, Grants, Stephens & Bells & Partridges—a wet grey morning, in the heart of London, where I am so seldom at that hour.

Such is my frontispiece, which needless to say, I meant to make more brilliant, but as Nessa said this morning, I dont want brilliance. The only thing I care for is to be at my ease, (we were discussing Mary).

Now, briefly to make out my work list.

I shall write at Mrs Dalloway till, next Monday, perhaps, bringing her into full talk, I hope.

Shall I then dash off an article for Squire upon memoirs? which will take till Monday 29th. Then do the Greek chapter, for which I shall have read Odyssey (6 books) Agamemnon: Oedipus Tyrannus, Zimmern, Jebb’s Homer—Life of Jebb, & some dialogue of Plato’s? This puts off writing till rather late in the day; but I want to make myself a certain amount of money regularly, if only for pocket money. Now, therefore, I must finish Pilkington; read Greek regularly; & tackle, perhaps, another vol of Proust. First then, I must master the Agamemnon (this refers to the immediate moment). & before doing that I must write to the new apparition Vita, who gives me a book every other day."
1923.01.16,"Katherine has been dead a week, & how far am I obeying her “do not quite forget Katherine” which I read in one of her old letters? Am I already forgetting her? It is strange to trace the progress of one’s feelings. Nelly said in her sensational way at breakfast on Friday “Mrs Murry’s dead! It says so in the paper!” At that one feels—what? A shock of relief?—a rival the less? Then confusion at feeling so little—then, gradually, blankness & disappointment; then a depression which I could not rouse myself from all that day. When I began to write, it seemed to me there was no point in writing. Katherine wont read it. Katherine’s my rival no longer. More generously I felt, But though I can do this better than she could, where is she, who could do what I can’t! Then, as usual with me, visual impressions kept coming & coming before me—always of Katherine putting on a white wreath, & leaving us, called away; made dignified, chosen. And then one pitied her. And one felt her reluctant to wear that wreath, which was an ice cold one. And she was only 33. And I could see her before me so exactly, & the room at Portland Villas. I go up. She gets up, very slowly, from her writing table. A glass of milk & a medicine bottle stood there. There were also piles of novels. Everything was very tidy, bright, & somehow like a dolls house. At once, or almost, we got out of shyness. She (it was summer) half lay on the sofa by the window. She had her look of a Japanese doll, with the fringe combed quite straight across her forehead. Sometimes we looked very steadfastly at each other, as though we had reached some durable relationship, independent of the changes of the body, through the eyes. Hers were beautiful eyes—rather doglike, brown, very wide apart, with a steady slow rather faithful & sad expression. Her nose was sharp, & a little vulgar. Her lips thin & hard. She wore short skirts & liked “to have a line round her” she said. She looked very ill—very drawn, & moved languidly, drawing herself across the room, like some suffering animal. I suppose I have written down some of the things we said. Most days I think we reached that kind of certainty, in talk about books, or rather about our writings, which I thought had something durable about it. And then she was inscrutable. Did she care for me? Sometimes she would say so—would kiss me—would look at me as if (is this sentiment?) her eyes would like always to be faithful. She would promise never never to forget. That was what we said at the end of our last talk. She said she would send me her diary to read, & would write always. For our friendship was a real thing we said, looking at each other quite straight. It would always go on whatever happened. What happened was, I suppose, faultfindings & perhaps gossip. She never answered my letter. Yet I still feel, somehow that friendship persists. Still there are things about writing I think of & want to tell Katherine. If I had been in Paris & gone to her, she would have got up & in three minutes, we should have been talking again. Only I could not take the step. The surroundings—Murry & so on—& the small lies & treacheries, the perpetual playing & teasing, or whatever it was, cut away much of the substance of friendship. One was too uncertain. And so one let it all go. Yet I certainly expected that we should meet again next summer, & start fresh. And I was jealous of her writing—the only writing I have ever been jealous of. This made it harder to write to her; & I saw in it, perhaps from jealousy, all the qualities I disliked in her.

For two days I felt that I had grown middle aged, & lost some spur to write. That feeling is going. I no longer keep seeing her with her wreath. I dont pity her so much. Yet I have the feeling that I shall think of her at intervals all through life. Probably we had something in common which I shall never find in anyone else. (This I say in so many words in 1919 again & again.) Moreover I like speculating about her character. I think I never gave her credit for all her physical suffering & the effect it must have had in embittering her.

The Nation is probably sold over Massingham’s head; L. has a violent cold. I have been in bed, 101, again. Fergusson threatens to cut my tonsils."
1923.01.28,"A certain melancholy has been brooding over me this fortnight. I date it from Katherine’s death. The feeling so often comes to me now—Yes. Go on writing of course: but into emptiness. There’s no competitor. I’m cock—a lonely cock whose crowing nothing breaks—of my walk. For our friendship had so much that was writing in it. However then I had my fever, & violent cold, was in & out of bed for a week, & still am below normal, I think. In casting accounts, never forget to begin with the state of the body.

K., so Ralph reports via Brett, died in 10 minutes of haemorrhage, walking upstairs with Murry who happened to be there. Brett is ‘very hard hit’ Ralph says. I soon shant have Ralph’s sayings to report. Does that make me melancholy? Like most of one’s feelings mine on losing him are mixed. We now have had Joad twice—Margery I should & do call her, & she comes tomorrow full time. She has a little too much powder & scent for my taste, & drawls. In short she is not upper class. But she has honest intent eyes, & takes it seriously, which, as she is quite without training, is as well. My only fear is lest she should prove a flibbertigibbet. Her quickness of movement, keenness, & dependability are so far a great gain on Ralph. There he sits thick as an oak & as angular. We have heard no more of the Tidmarsh Press.

I have seen quantities of people—having them here, as my invalid ways induced, bright pictures, tunes on the gramophone—but I must not insult the human soul for which I have really so much respect. Bobo & Betty have nothing sharp or bright about them. Both seem to dissolve in a November cloud; depressed, emotional, with no target for emotion. Bobo is vaguely indulging in an affair—perhaps with a medical student called Stanley—(she does not confide names). He takes her out, makes love, which she enjoys but finds somehow inferior. She likes the surroundings. She had been out with him somewhere, the night before, & said the surroundings were glittering. She yielded to the unreality; then repented, & told him this was the last time. Then she repents of that, forages in her pocket for principles, forages in mine, & I, not knowing her case, advised her to fling herself into life, to reflect, but not to withdraw, which of course pointed the way she secretly wished, & yet privately feels impure. So do I in this case.

Betty had not even any case to put before me. Never was there a limper, less objective, creature. There she lounges in the arm chair opposite, never thinking she need speak, or invent, or comment or do any of the tricks which human beings have devised for keeping the water fresh. One stagnates kindly, gently. She is a nice girl, by which I mean gentle & affectionate, but also clinging & selfish & egotistical. She says dress is a great snare. She says she lives with rotten people. She says she means to go abroad & learn singing. Meanwhile she has taken a flat in the Queen’s Road [? Richmond], so far from her haunts that she must lunch out, & spends hours daily wandering the streets, looking in at shop windows I suppose & coveting dresses.

Who else? Roger & Bob: Bob with his lid on, not talking but bubbling underneath. He had to be kept under or would have foamed all over us. Much talk of the Nation, wh, as I should have recorded, is sold to Maynard & a group, & our future once more quite uncertain. Still I cant fabricate doubts, & hereby record my expectation that we shall emerge richer in 2 months time. Massingham will start a new paper: Maynard will retain Leonard at a handsome fee. And then? (I race, before dinner comes.) Roger’s lecture, the last. Before it I dined with Noel Olivier (Richards) at the Club. She looked at me with those strange eyes in which a drop seems to have been spilt—a pale blue drop, with a large deep centre—romantic eyes, that seem to behold still Rupert bathing in the river at Christow: eyes pure & wide, & profound it seems. Or is there nothing behind them? I as good as asked her. Why didn’t you marry any of those romantic young men? Why? Why? She didn’t know, said she had moods; all Oliviers are mad she said. And Rupert had gone with Cathleen Nesbitt & she had been jealous, & he had spoken against women & gone among the Asquiths & changed. But when she read his love letters—beautiful beautiful love letters—real love letters, she said—she cries & cries. How direct & unyielding these young women are. But she is “over 30”—she would not say how much. & I am 41: which I confess. So we parted.

Then?—Morgan, buttoned like a hairdresser, cheerful, communicative, but come to talk business & soon gone.

Then Lilian [Harris], with her hands in her lap, facing old age, & horribly bored. The egotism—gentle & blood sucking—of these elderly women! She wanted work, advice, & the names of Inns. I was amused to detect her complete absorption in Margaret; her childlike record of every symptom meal & habit. But this is natural, indeed charming & pathetic too."
1923.02.07,"Nessa’s wedding day. Reflections suppressed. I must describe Cambridge. We walked from the station, past Rattee & Kett, cold, starry; dismal; then familiar; King’s College Chapel, hasty wash & dress, & dine with Sheppard. He was in evening dress. He carries a knobbed cane. Maynard, Norton, & Betty to dinner. A good deal of raw time had to be manufactured. I had romanced so much about Cambridge that to find myself sitting there was an anti climax. No one else was excited. Then off in the motor to the A.D.C. I think I was genuinely excited, rather than moved by Oedipus Rex. The plot is so well tied; the storys⁠[?] race so fast. Then the young men’s faces; pink & plump under their wigs, moved me. I don’t know whether memory poured a little mist. Among the audience were: Lytton, Irene Vanbrugh; Q; Faith; & so on. And so to bed; with King’s bell saying very pompously all through the night the hour. We were happy & busy all Sunday, first Sheppard, then Pernel; sitting on the Backs, strolling up to Newnham the way I used to go; then lunching with the Shoves, & Fredegond is the image of Christina Rossetti. Her faith is charitable. She has nothing very definite to say. She attends mass. She is happier & more full of vitality than before she says. Gerald, she says, took her to be confirmed, watched with interest &, coming out, wished he had a faith; wished to be a Quaker, but has taken no further steps. I think she makes the most of chance words he lets fall. So to the Moores, finding Moore smoking alone, who asked us directly whether we would come up or have the children brought down. Stout Dorothy was bathing Timothy & smoking—a truncated woman, amiable, red, a little beery; anyhow cheery; & Moore said, very kindly, dearie to the baby, crying for food, like a wise old nurse. Rather they were like a couple of fat beavers with their young. Fine little cubs too, fat, hard, sturdy, likely to do us all credit when we are all dead. The elegiac note will creep in, & shall be justified if I have time. Then to Maynard’s: I must say the pleasantest sitting room I have ever been in, owing to the colours & paintings, curtains & decorations of Bell & Grant. Here we dined well. Ramsay, the unknown guest, was something like a Darwin, broad, thick, powerful, & a great mathematician, & clumsy to boot. Honest I should say, a true Apostle. The party began after a few brilliancies on my part about religion; emotional [?] capital which I did not know how to invest, I said. And Maynard kept the old ball smartly rolling. Indeed we were rather talk-dazed. And as people arrived, I suppose one’s eyes tire; one’s brain stales. Lucas is slightly deaf, & pure & sincere, needs that is rather an effort to talk to in the grand style, about literature. Besides, I rather wished to hear Sprott praise Jacob’s Room. Never mind. Mrs Birch, honourable Mrs Birch of Firle, was introduced; like a white wild fox, body perfectly trained, intelligence wild. not a bad combination. Like Vita she detests the scrolloping honours of the great, calls her family dull & stupid, complains of a girls life, Lowndes Square, Ascot, & Aunts who rail against what they call Bo-eemians. She should have married a Guardsman, & is now in Cambridge society, believing in Topsy as I could see, & in Mrs Dobree; humbly taking from our hands whatever we choose to give.

The depression which I mentioned comes partly from the uncertainty about the Nation. Leonard thinks himself a failure. And what use is there in denying a depression which is irrational? Can’t I always think myself one too? It is inevitable. But there was Maynard arrived & trim, yet our junior. The absurd unreality of this as a standard strikes me, but it is not easy to make these truths effective. It is unpleasant waiting in a dependent kind of way to know what Massingham will do. The signs are favourable. Ramsay Muir, Maynard’s editor, is on all hands a dull dog; Maynard is entreating Tomlinson to join him, & so support him against the Wee Frees, who are his co-directors. My notion is, he will float the Nation, make a splash, then dive off, & leave it to its fate within the year. It will dwindle & die. Massingham is optimistic, but delays at Monte Carlo, & we only hear, vaguely, that he has a good chance of starting a threepenny weekly to coincide with the break on April 1st.

And our depression comes too from the time of year, wet & wan, and from Joad’s drawling voice, & Ralph’s stubbornness, & from Lytton’s hint that he means to start the Tidmarsh Press at once. Here, however, is some mystery, for Carrington professed to know nothing of it, & would only admit to a press for printing refined books, on commission—I think Joad & Ralph daily for lunch & tea, & the need for bright talk, depress also; & I shall be glad when the 15th March arrives. I suppose the Press must now lose something of its charm, & become more strenuous; acquiring let us hope a different charm. But I wish Joad were, somehow, a lady. Now to Wigmore Hall with Saxon to hear a severe Franck quintet, beyond me no doubt."
1923.02.10,"The omens are, I think, more favourable. Maynard has presented an ultimatum, to the effect I think, but this was gathered on the telephone, that he will not work with Ramsay Muir. For my own part, what with this & that, I think it fairly certain that Massingham’s side will now prevail, in some form or other, since even if the Rowntrees are raging as red oxen, they must be open eyed enough to see that they can’t safely deposit their trust in the Wee Frees minus Maynard. Then we have £40 from income tax return—I seem to see a feather floating favourably from that region where the Gods abide. So I said as we walked in the cemetery this afternoon. A charwoman was planting hyacinths on a wet grave. She was all wet grey wool; dull, drab, like a jackal; & I prowled too among the graves to look at names, & ascertain who could be deserving of several tons of granite crucifix—the Belgian soldiers, so it turned out. On we walk again. The spring the spring, I sing in imitation of Wagner, & saw a gorze bush set with soft yellow buds. Then we got into the Park, where the rain drove dogs & humans home, & so back, on the stroke of three. It is now our plan (a day old) to walk from 2 to 3; print from 3 to 5; delay our tea; & so make headway. In fact I set up a little of Read. Morgan is finished, save for one last printing off. Ralph sticks on, defiant, argumentative, & gives one the lowest opinion of the manly virtues.

Is Mary an example of the womanly? She may be a good actress. She had a long talk with me two days ago, in the dusk, over the fire. The upshot of it is to my mind a little complex: does Vanessa misrepresent her? I don’t accuse her of brilliance & wit. But I think I detect a humbler spirit than I expected; she is, she said, shy. And she never likes the people who like her, but attaches herself in spite of all snubs to those she likes. This refers to 46. She has a temper. She flies out. She would like to live with people in numbers—not merely see them. (I thought this sincere). She might be one of those impulsive, affectionate, rather unfortunately concocted natures who are to me interesting, perpetually venturing out, rashly importunate, & then snubbed back again; aspiring; fastidious, vain & so on, but impelled by a kind of passion, for Clive, I suppose, which is sincere. Then of course I rate a womans sensibility & sympathy very high, as pleasure givers that is. Nor is she uncritical: far from it. Didn’t she tell me she could think me lovable if my desire for admiration about everything were not so insatiable? No, I said, I only want on most points to be assured that I’m of the average human stature. I have my astonishing twists & kinks, as you do. For I couldn’t imagine you shy. Yet you say you can hardly brace yourself to enter the Ritz!—your triumphal path, I should have said. And is she really tremulous? a far more instinctive nature than mine or Nessa’s & therefore one we are likely to misjudge. Nothing new, she said, would ever happen to her again. She loves pleasure, I note; & though she neither writes nor paints looks forward to the summer. One will get the blinds out, she said. But I suppose I talked most, & about myself. How I’d been depressed since Jan. 3rd. We ran it to earth, I think, by discovering that I began journalism on that day. Last Thursday, I think, I returned to fiction, to the instant nourishment & well being of my entire day. I wonder if this next lap will be influenced by Proust? I think his French language, tradition, &c, prevents that: yet his command of every resource is so extravagant that one can hardly fail to profit, & must not flinch, through cowardice."
1923.02.19,"How it would interest me if this diary were ever to become a real diary: something in which I could see changes, trace moods developing; but then I should have to speak of the soul, & did I not banish the soul when I began? What happens is, as usual, that I’m going to write about the soul, & life breaks in. Talking of diaries sets me thinking of old Kate, in the dining room at 4 Rosary Gardens; & how she opened the cabinet (wh. I remember) & there in a row on a shelf were her diaries from Jan 1 1877. Some were brown; others red; all the same to a t. And I made her read an entry; one of many thousand days, like pebbles on a beach: morning, evening, afternoon, without accent. Oh how strangely unaccented she is, sitting there all of a piece, white, unjointed, level, sagacious, with the mute sagacity of elephant or grey mare! Only once or twice did I strike a spark in the one remaining pale blue eye, which is tenderer than the glass one. Orderly solidity marked every atom there. The vases stood on mats: each was supplied with a tuft of mimosa & maidenhair. The Xmas cards—6—were ranged on the mantelpiece. Helen, photo, in frame. Red tiles newly dusted. Green walls. Objects that came from India; bookcase that belonged to Nun. Did I remember it. And said Kate I intend to live to 1944 when I shall be 84. And on her last day she will say to the charwoman who attends her, Bring me the diaries which you will find in the cabinet; & now, put them on the fire. I scarcely tried to disturb what had the sculptured classic appearance of alabaster fruit beneath glass.

In scribbling this, I am led away from my soul, which interests me nevertheless. My soul peeped out. For it is the soul I fancy that comments on visitors & reports their comments, & sometimes sets up such a to-do in the central departments of my machinery that the whole globe of me dwindles to a button head. I think this dwindling is often the result of talking to second rate people. They make the world pinch beck. Now with my dear old Leo, such cheapening is unknown. Oh no, he may refuse to kindle, but he never detracts; & so, when he does kindle, the glow is of the purest fiery red—what I see in the fire now, verging on white.

Philip [Morrell] wished to be an actor, & suffers from dual personality. He sees himself, & seldom unifies—sees himself farmer, host, speaker, & so on. But talking to us he felt himself single, so he said, & there is something diluted in the quality of his emotion. He is an amorous man, a man of a different generation & tradition, in cross over waistcoat & jewels, half man of the world, half aesthete, appreciating furniture that is, but living my word! among what humbugs, & palming them off on us plausibly enough—Ottoline &c. Layers of shifting vapour trail over him perpetually, keep him restless, chattering uneasy. They have shut Julian in a convent school at Roehampton in order to break the stubborn materialism of her nature. She conflicts with Ott’s vision of the universe. Philip says she runs after young men. And Philip has had his brat by the parlourmaid. It is all, at the foundations, a little obscene & pullulating, though on the surface so admirable, plausible—yes, plausible in the word that recurs, & uneasy.

We had a surprise visit from the Nicolsons. She is a pronounced Sapphist, & may, thinks Ethel Sands, have an eye on me, old though I am. Nature might have sharpened her faculties. Snob as I am, I trace her passions 500 years back, & they become romantic to me, like old yellow wine. I fancy the tang is gone. Harold is simple down right bluff; wears short black coat & check trousers; wishes to be a writer, but is not I’m told & can believe, adapted by nature. Soul, you see, is framing all these judgments, & saying as she sits by the fire, this is not to my liking, this is second rate, this vulgar; this nice, sincere, & so on. And how should my soul know? My soul diminished, alas, as the evening wore on; & the contraction is almost physically depressing. I reflect though that I’m the sink of 50 million pneumonia germs with a temperature well below normal. And so these contractions are largely physical, I’ve no doubt. And we are still in suspense. Massingham is back; but Maynard is on the war path. Massm. says he is now going full speed ahead. He has to collect money. Strangely enough, I with my telephone, am acting as go between. I find out Maynard’s plans from Nessa; L. telephones them on to Massm. And also I am trying to pull wires, to seat Tom at the Nation as literary editor, & unseat my foe Miss Royde Smith. Had I time I could detail my activities, & glory in my own importance. Yes, I am grown up. I give advice. I am taken seriously; & this no longer flurries me with excitement. I am a little bored indeed, & could wish that poor dear Tom had more spunk in him, less need to let drop by drop of his agonised perplexities fall ever so finely through pure cambric. One waits; sympathises, but it is dreary work. He is like a person about to break down—infinitely scrupulous, tautologous, & cautious.

Poor Snow can scarcely have her portrait drawn. But how I pitied her! like an old woman forced to stare at a pitiless light. The flesh & juice of life have left her. She is brittle, airy, might blow along the gutter. Her old sparks & acidities have dissolved. She was nervous, had lost confidence, as if life had thrown her, but she must still ride on. I could feel her envying me. This I like, but still it depresses me. And then she wavers, apologises, says “Oh you would be bored if I came to stay!” & looks so searchingly at me, & wont be deceived. She amused me by saying that the streets of Cheltenham are notoriously unsafe. Foot passengers are perpetually killed by bicyclists. It is the rarest thing to motor through without being asked to take a corpse to the doctors. And there was her story of the old lady of 94 poking the fire & almost breaking her own body with the coal. Sometimes she does fall down, & is light as a leaf to pick up. She sits in a room with a skylight, & sometimes can see a tree wave, but never goes out."
1923.03.06,"Undoubtedly this has been a very unpleasant quarter. I date our misery from Jan. 3rd. The main grievance has been this Nation affair, which hangs over us, lifting, then lowering, as it is at the present moment—low & black over our heads. Massm. goes on April 7th: our income ceases; Maynard has made us no definite offer—but that I think is assured so far as L. goes. But that is only £120 p.a. & we shall have to scrape up the rest rather dismally, doing journalism, I suppose. Msm. is now said to be waiting for the return of a gentleman in the East, who will he is certain finance him. The scheme is off till October anyhow. But its not the money trouble that worries us: but something psychological. The gloom is more on L.’s side than on mine. Mine is a gloom like a mist that comes & goes. One is unsettled. I dip into different circles—like Mary’s, E. Sands’, the Richmonds’ concert, & come home either exalted or depressed. My chairs look dirty. Then the social question rises between L. & me. Are we becoming ‘respectable’? Shall we dine with the Richmonds. L. says no. I regret it. Yes, some how I regret it seriously, this shutting of the door upon suburban studies. I love the chatter & excitement of other peoples houses. Have I not just said that it depresses me too? But then I wanted to meet Percy Lubbock & show myself off as a woman who can talk sense. & so on. I ask people here too often. In short I must take the social side into my own hands. I have, I think, got Reading on its feet, & hope to make way, & find my solace in that. But still I want to make life fuller & fuller.

Poor Katherine has taken to revisiting the earth; she has been seen at Brett’s; by the charwoman. I feel this somehow a kind of judgment on her for writing the kind of thing she did. Brett told me the story the other day & seemed so bare & rasped that I could not have taken this comfort from her had I wished. Nor do I wish, seriously, to obstruct any decent investigation of brains & nerves, seeing how much I’ve suffered that way myself. But then Brett is not scientific; she at once takes the old fables seriously, & repeats some jargon learnt of Dunning, but no doubt diluted in transit, about day & night, birth, & therefore death, all being beautiful. She feels the ‘contact’ she says; & has had revelations; & there she sits deaf, injured, solitary, brooding over death, & hearing voices, which soon will become, I expect, entirely fabulous; & even now talking to her has a good deal robbed the image of K.M. of its distinctness. For it came distinctly back when I read her letters. And I saw her wink when poor Brett’s note was handed in, & she said that little person can wait, or something like that. Now B. idolises her, & invests her with every quality of mind & soul. Do people always get what they deserve, & did K.M. do something to deserve this cheap posthumous life? & am I jealous even now?

No: I think one can be honest at my age.

Old Elena crossed the room to talk to me on Sunday. Oh how shy I was! How matronly & magnificent in a thick rich black way she was! & we couldn’t look each other in the eyes—at least I couldn’t; & she felt me shabby, self-conscious, suburban no doubt. I am putting down notes to use later in re-constructing this period. There is, I think, a sense of frustration & futility about just now. Partly the Nation again, I’ve no doubt, partly…. Never mind, I say; once get my claws into my writing & I’m safe. Eliot slightly disillusions me too; he is peevish, plaintive, egotistical; what it amounts to is that poverty is unbecoming. He nibbles at cherries. True, the offer, to co-operate with Royde Smith, is a wizened cherry. But he elaborates & complicates, makes one feel that he dreads life as a cat dreads water. But if I hint so much he is all claws. Now, considering my activity on his behalf no doubt I have some of the vile & patronising feelings of the benefactor. Its American, L. says; that & neurotic. I consulted Bruce Richmond—another proof of my importance. He said emphatically “He’s not the man for the job.” I can’t help agreeing.

But life, life! How I long to take you in my arms & crush you out!"
1923.03.13,"Written, for a wonder at 10 o’clock at night, with L. doing Tolstoi at the white table; the fire rather hot, & my brain saturated with the Silent Woman. I am reading her because we now read plays at 46. 46 is become a centre. For how long we don’t know, as Maynard’s marriage approaches. Nessa, astride her fine Arab, life I mean, takes further upheavals all in the days work. I daresay I shall feel it more. 46 has been very pleasant to me this winter. Two nights ago the Nicolsons dined there. Exposed to electric light eggs show dark patches. I mean we judged them both incurably stupid. He is bluff, but oh so obvious; she, Duncan thought, took the cue from him, & had nothing free to say. There was Lytton, supple & subtle as an old leather glove, to emphasise their stiffness. It was a rocky steep evening. We had the photographs out. Lytton said “I don’t like your mother’s character. Her mouth seems complaining” & a shaft of white light fell across my dusky rich red past.

And then? As to the soul, I’ve been snubbed by Squire. I sent him my memoir article, asking terms: he accepted, offering £13; £15 I said, or my ms back; & got it back by return. And now I accept £13—which perhaps I shan’t get after all. Yet I dont much mind. & only think that poverty & the shifts it puts one to is unbecoming, as I’ve said. Poor Tom the other day actually couldn’t speak for tears (thanking us) on the telephone. He is broken down, & yet must buckle to & decide: shall he take the Nation? can he defeat Maynard? I’m tired of writing the word guarantee—which is what he claims. To show his state, Richmond actually rang me up at 10 p.m. & asked me to intervene with Maynard. He seemed ‘distraught’ he said. Whether distraught people can edit the Nation lit. sup. I doubt. And it is more or less my doing. And I dont feel important. And after all we are happy. And Ralph is gone, casually, without good bye. I have seen Osbert Sitwell, Sebastian Sprot & Mr Mortimer. As Nessa says, we are becoming fashionable. Sprot & I lunched at Mary’s; then, tipsy with echoing brains, went to tea at Hill’s in [Kensington] High Street. Infinitely old I felt & rich; he is very poor. His mother used to attend Barker’s linen sales, so that he knew High Street. I dont know why his experience seemed to me so meagre. His father is a solicitor at Crowborough. He wished to meet Ottoline. He is hungry as a wolf, & snapping up delicacies in an alarming way. If at his age I had met Ottoline!—still, I wasn’t much older. I have been reflecting about society again, & think one of its merits is that it needs courage. The going into rooms properly dressed is alarming. No one cares for one; that snubs vanity; one is on equal terms with one’s fellows. The privileges of the fireside no longer prevail. But Ethel [Sands] is off till October; & I don’t know where next I shall alight. Indeed this is scribbled before a break.—Only for one month, but then physically, perhaps spiritually, the journey is long. How great writers write at night, I don’t know. Its an age since I tried, & I find my head full of pillow stuffing: hot; inchoate. And tomorrow I must get on with How it Strikes a Contemporary. Alas, for the break in my scheme of work—but we must make money, just when I don’t want to; & so the novels get shelved, & Reading, which I had tackled afresh, must be put away, & I must accept Desmond’s reviewing, & Maynard’s too, if offered; still I haven’t any good cause to complain."
1923.03.23,"No, not much reason to complain. L. has just come in with an offer from Maynard of the literary editorship of the Nation. Well, thats unexpected! Here have I been toiling these 3 weeks to make Eliot take it; finally he shied; & this is the result. No doubt there are drawbacks, but it means safety for the moment, indeed luxury. And to me it opens interesting vistas—but here I am with the typhoid germs & cant write."
1923.05.11,"The long break deserves a line, since I shall scarcely commemorate it otherwise. Have I not with infinite labour, written for the first number of the Nation To Spain? Am I not sitting waiting for L. to ‘come back from the office’ like other wives. It annoys me to be like other wives. Ah there he is! No: damn it; only Nelly gone out. As I say, I cannot go into the journey, the Temples, Brenan, Spain, Paris, et cetera. I stayed in Paris by way of facing life. Yes, I clap the spurs to my flanks & see myself taking fences gallantly. I ‘took Jane [Harrison] & Hope [Mirrlees]; not much else, save the French language, at which I failed ignominiously, & now must learn to speak French if I am in future to respect myself. I meant to use this diary to pull myself up from a fortnights debauch of journalism, Nations affairs, & so on. I must make out a work scheme. But for a moment I will dally with description. Margery [Joad] is doing well, a sign of which is that we now scarcely notice her accent. If she were doing badly it would grate upon us intolerably. We are well up in our books.

Morgan dined here the other night. We tried to cajole him to write with £10 p. 1,000 for bait. “But I dont want £200 a year” he said. “I daresay I could spend it if I had it, but I don’t want it.” So what vice could we appeal to? Vanity was not much touched. Then he has an ascetic regard for principles. People he respects think that M⁠[assingha]⁠m. was badly treated. At any rate, Morgan wd. not like to write for us, & not for Desmond, who pays £4 instead of £10. He is detached as a saint. And we couldnt press him. So far, we don’t feel the Nation blood of our blood. It may turn that way. We work very hard at it. It has temptations & attractions. How they balance the drawbacks I don’t yet know. I like having the pick of new books. My own authority over the reviewing staff is not very exciting. I am a little malicious perhaps. People crowd & crush & press for work. It is mildly amusing to say, now don’t worry, I’m not going to give you any. I have been so often in their position. But these delights are not very profound. I’m afraid it looks as though Reading must again be shelved. I can’t afford not to make hay just now. One article a month paid at £15 or so. And that precisely uses the time I had to spend from writing my novel. Yet, to take up my work account, I think I must edge in a little time every now & then at Reading. I am at the Greek chapter (in reading). Shall I read a little Greek? My notion is that I can only sketch the chapter, & must perpetually enrich it from time to time. Or shall I plunge into early Elizabethans, of whom I am appallingly ignorant? What happened between Chaucer & Shakespeare? I think that attracts me as a basis. Make notes then; &, directly opportunity offers, dash in at the Pastons & Chaucer. One might read Troilus & Cressida; but I dont feel inclined."
1923.05.12,"It is a curious fact that I can write this diary when I am too much distracted to read. Being Sunday, I am clearing off old letters, half formal; & seven strikes; & 15 minutes can’t be made much of for any purpose. I might attempt a portrait. Karin was here yesterday with Ann. Adrian is altogether broken up by psycho analysis. (long interruption question of printing Read) His soul rent in pieces with a view to reconstruction. The doctor says he is a tragedy: & this tragedy consists in the fact that he can’t enjoy life with zest. I am probably responsible. I should have paired with him, instead of hanging on to the elders. So he wilted, pale, under a stone of vivacious brothers & sisters. Karin says we shall see a great change in 3 months. But Noel [Olivier] would have done what none of these doctors can do. The truth is that Karin, being deaf, & as she honestly says, “Your sister-in-law lacks humanity, as perhaps you’ve noticed”, the truth is she does not fertilise the sunk places in Adrian. Neither did I. Had mother lived, or father been screened off—well, it puts it too high to call it a tragedy. Ann is like him, pale, lank, sensitive, with the long cold fingers I know so well. For my part, I doubt if family life has all the power of evil attributed to it, or psycho-analysis of good. I liked Karin; pitied her too; & then felt come over me some mood of depression, not worth entering upon here.

Morgan told me that when he & Mortimer discussed novelists the other day they agreed that Lawrence & I were the only two whose future interested them. They think of my next book, which I think of calling “The Hours”, with excitement. This does encourage me. Oddly enough, I get praise from my contemporaries, or youngers; never from old stagers, who are said to step so generously from their platforms with words of encouragment."

But I cannot describe Garsington. Thirty seven people to tea; a bunch of young men no bigger than asparagus; walking to & fro, round & round; compliments, attentions, & then this slippery mud—which is what interests me at the moment. A loathing overcomes me of human beings—their insincerity, their vanity—A wearisome & rather defiling talk with Ott. last night is the foundation of this complaint—& then the blend in one’s own mind of suavity & sweetness with contempt & bitterness. Her egotism is so great. “I am much more sensitive than most people” she said to Julian: the first words she said that she meant. She returns to that subject again & again—to herself that is. And her lies have taken away all outlines. Yet on Saturday night I liked her. This was all clear to me a few minutes ago, but now I cannot write it.

Lyt⁠[t]⁠on & I talked all the way up in the train. He had seen a Greek Temple at Segestum. And that’s what I adore in him—his enthusiasm for beauty. He said it was like Sophocles. You saw the sea through the columns. Then we discussed Sh⁠[akespea]⁠re: he said he wanted to write about Shre as a dramatist; not as a philosopher or poet. He wanted to discuss his contrasts. The scene with Emilia in Othello for instance. And he may write on Lear from this point of view. And Sir Thomas Browne, & the letters of Phalaris; I think he has written something that pleases him. He is absolutely happy. He is in love with Ralph. He has that extraordinary simplicity he said tenderly, tremulously, talking of Ralph & Othello. But why not let oneself be content in the thought of Lytton—so true, gentle, infinitely nimble, & humane? I seldom rest long in complete agreement with anyone. But here I think one’s feelings should be unqualified.

Lord David is a pretty boy. Puffin Asquith an ugly one—wizened, unimpressive, sharp, like a street boy. Sackville West reminded me of a peevish shop girl. They have all the same clipped quick speech & politeness, & total insignificance. Yet we asked Ld David & Puff to write for the Nation, & also a dull fat man called Hartley. What puts me on edge is that I’m writing like this here, & spoke so differently to Ott. I’m over peevish in private, partly in order to assert myself. I am a great deal interested suddenly in my book. I want to bring in the despicableness of people like Ott: I want to give the slipperiness of the soul. I have been too tolerant often. The truth is people scarcely care for each other. They have this insane instinct for life. But they never become attached to anything outside themselves. Puff said he loved his family, & had nothing whatever to knock over. He disliked cold indecency. So did Lord David. This must be a phrase in their set. Puff said—I dont quite know what. I walked round the vegetable garden with him, passing Lytton flirting with Byam Shaw on a green seat; & round the field with Sackville West, who said he was better & was writing a better novel, & round the lake with Menasseh (?) an Egyptian Jew, who said he liked his family, & they were mad & talked like books; & he said that they quoted my writings (the Oxford youth) & wanted me to go & speak; & then there was Mrs Asquith. I was impressed. She is stone white: with the brown veiled eyes of an aged falcon; & in them more depth & scrutiny than I expected; a character, with her friendliness, & ease, & decision. Oh if we could have had Shelley’s poems, & not Shelley the man! she said. Shelley was quite intolerable, she pronounced; she is a rigid frigid puritan; & in spite of spending thousands on dress. She rides life, if you like; & has picked up a thing or two, which I should like to plunder & never shall. She led Lytton off, & plucked his arm, & hurried, & thought ‘people’ pursued her; yet was very affable with ‘people’ when she had to be; sat on the window sill talking to a black shabby embroideress, to whom Ott. is being kind. Thats one of her horrors—she’s always being kind in order to say to herself at night & then Ottoline invites the poor little embroideress to her party, & so to round off her own picture of herself. To sneer like this has a physical discomfort in it. She told me I looked wonderfully well, wh. I disliked. Why? I wonder. Because I had had a headache perhaps, partly. But to be well & use strength to get more out of life is, surely, the greatest fun in the world. What I dislike is feeling that I’m always taking care, or being taken care of. Never mind—work, work. Lytton says we have still 20 years before us. Mrs Asquith said she loved Scott. If I had time I would describe my surprise visit from Sydney, & my revelations about Murry’s duplicity. This is a very great shock, Sydney said. Sydney said that Murry has an angel & a devil in him. That is melodramatic said Sydney; but I do believe it. Dunning believes it. I cant help liking Sydney—fundamentally honest; fundamentally weak; gullible; & now settling down to ‘repose’, which is very delightful. And he’s a vegetarian. Such a simplification, he said. But if I saw you every day for a week I could tell you what has been happening to me. Vegetarianism is part of a whole revolution—Don’t I know it without being told it. And the Adelphi would inform me, were I ignorant. Now for Urn Burial for the Times."
1923.06.13,"Nessa is back & the London season of course in full swing. So I judged yesterday in the Aeolian Hall, listening, in a dazed way, to Edith Sitwell vociferating through the megaphone. There was Lady Colefax in her hat with the green ribbons. Did I say that I lunched with her last week? That was Derby Day & it rained, & all the light was brown & cold, & she went on talking talking, in consecutive sentences like the shavings that come from planes, artificial, but unbroken. It was not a successful party, Clive & Lytton & me. For Clive’s back; & he dined here with Leo Myers the other night; & then I went to Golders Green & sat with Mary Sheepshanks in her garden, & beat up the waters of talk, as I do so courageously, so that life mayn’t be wasted. The fresh breeze went brushing all the thick hedges which divide the gardens. Somehow, extraordinary emotions possessed me. I forget now what. Often now I have to control my excitement—as if I were pushing through a screen; or as if something beat fiercely close to me. What this portends I don’t know. It is a general sense of the poetry of existence that overcomes me. Often it is connected with the sea & St Ives. Going to 46 continues to excite. Dear old Nessa returned shabby, loose, easy; & 44, so she said. The sight of 2 coffins in the Underground luggage office I daresay constricts [?] all my feelings. I have the sense of the flight of time; & this shores up my emotions. N. & I sat talking, both now well known women, if it comes to that. At dinner we discussed what school Quentin should go to. “He means to be a painter”, said Nessa. “Yes” said Quentin, as if he were saying “yes, I am in love.” At least it made me feel queer.

Nothing else of great importance has happened. I should be describing Edith Sitwell’s poems, but I kept saying to myself “I dont really understand—I dont really admire.” The only view, presentable view that I framed, was to the effect that she was monotonous. She has one tune only on her merry go round. And she makes her verse keep step accurately to the Hornpipe. This seems to be wrong; but I’m all sandy with writing criticism, & must be off to my book again. Leo Myers, who is glazed with disillusionment & middle age, as tongues are glazed, said that my turn & turn about method is wrong. The Drs say so. He goes in for this kind of frigid examination of things. He has no impulses, nothing to do. He goes out every night everywhere. Clive & he capped stories of the demi-monde. Next day Clive rang up & said he had been ashamed. I fancy Clive is trying to take in a reef or two in his white waistcoat of dissipation. And as usual I want—I want—But what do I want? Whatever I had, I should always say I want, I want. Yet it comes over me that to sit on the grass at the Horse Show tomorrow with L. will be very contenting. But then I want to go to the Opera. Leo Myers said we all feel excluded. Yet he has 8,000 a year, tax free, 2 houses, 2 children, 1 motor car. We try to impress each other, he said; & had told me of a journey to Cherbourg for this purpose. True, I was deeply impressed. I said to myself he crossed in the Aquitania: then he was quite free to go anywhere he liked. His life was full of romance. And it was I who got the romance by thinking this, not poor Leo, who is glazed like a tongue.

For the rest, I should be writing to Mrs Eliot. & will, now, directly, on the instant. I say nothing about Duncan’s show: about Mollie Hamilton or Henderson who dined last night, or Bob."
1923.06.19,"I took up this book with a kind of idea that I might say something about my writing—which was prompted by glancing at what K.M. said about her writing in the Dove’s Nest. But I only glanced. She said a good deal about feeling things deeply: also about being pure, which I wont criticise, though of course I very well could. But now what do I feel about my writing?—this book, that is, The Hours, if thats its name? One must write from deep feeling, said Dostoevsky. And do I? Or do I fabricate with words, loving them as I do? No I think not. In this book I have almost too many ideas. I want to give life & death, sanity & insanity; I want to criticise the social system, & to show it at work, at its most intense—But here I may be posing. I heard from Ka this morning that she doesn’t like In the Orchard. At once I feel refreshed. I become anonymous, a person who writes for the love of it. She takes away the motive of praise, & lets me feel that without any praise, I should be content to go on. This is what Duncan said of his painting the other night. I feel as if I slipped off all my ball dresses & stood naked—which as I remember was a very pleasant thing to do. But to go on. Am I writing The Hours from deep emotion? Of course the mad part tries me so much, makes my mind squint so badly that I can hardly face spending the next weeks at it. Its a question though of these characters. People, like Arnold Bennett, say I cant create, or didn’t in J’s R, characters that survive. My answer is—but I leave that to the Nation: its only the old argument that character is dissipated into shreds now: the old post-Dostoevsky argument. I daresay its true, however, that I haven’t that ‘reality’ gift. I insubstantise, wilfully to some extent, distrusting reality—its cheapness. But to get further. Have I the power of conveying the true reality? Or do I write essays about myself? Answer these questions as I may, in the uncomplimentary sense, & still there remains this excitement. To get to the bones, now I’m writing fiction again I feel my force flow straight from me at its fullest. After a dose of criticism I feel that I’m writing sideways, using only an angle of my mind. This is justification; for free use of the faculties means happiness. I’m better company, more of a human being. Nevertheless, I think it most important in this book to go for the central things, even though they dont submit, as they should however, to beautification in language. No, I don’t nail my crest to the Murrys, who work in my flesh after the manner of the jigger insect. Its annoying, indeed degrading, to have these bitternesses. Still, think of the 18th Century. But then they were overt, not covert, as now.

I foresee, to return to The Hours, that this is going to be the devil of a struggle. The design is so queer & so masterful. I’m always having to wrench my substance to fit it. The design is certainly original, & interests me hugely. I should like to write away & away at it, very quick and fierce. Needless to say, I cant. In three weeks from today I shall be dried up.

Having made this very inadequate confession about the soul, I may turn now to the body—which is money & America & Mr Crowninshield. I’m asked to write for Vanity Fair & shall be paid says Clive £25 for 1500 words: & get £15 from the Nation; & two months ago I was hawking articles of 5,000 words to Jack Squire for £13.

Do you like becoming famous? Marjorie [Joad] asked me yesterday. The truth is I’m being pushed up, but many people are saying that I shant last, & perhaps I shant. So I return to my old feeling of nakedness as the backbone of my existence, which indeed it is.

For the rest, it is observed in Cornwall & the remoter parts of Weybridge that we are living through a storm of obloquy & must be entirely engrossed in the Nation’s affairs. It is not so at Hogarth House: I’m no longer so excited about the contents of L.’s dispatch box. But one thing I do feel pretty certain about & here confide it to my diary—we must leave Richmond & set up in London. The arguments are so well known to me that I cant bother to write them down. But when things come upon me in a clap I generally achieve them, because they are then things that matter to me. Leonard remains to be converted, & my God, the move—the horror—the servants. Still this is life—never to be sitting down for longer than one feels inclined."
1923.06.28,"This may be life; but I doubt that I shall ever convert L. & now sit down baffled & depressed to face a life spent, mute & mitigated, in the suburbs, just as I had it in mind that I could at last go full speed ahead. For the capacities in me will never after 40, accumulate again. And I mind missing life far more than he does, for it isn’t life to him in the sense that it is life to me. Oh to be able to slip in & out of things easily, to be in them, not on the verge of them—I resent this effort & waste. My evening is now wasted because I’m dining with the Myers. But what should be my course now? Really, I think, to find out exactly how much I mean by this. But half the horror is that L. instead of being, as I gathered, sympathetic has the old rigid obstacle—my health. And I cant sacrifice his peace of mind, yet the obstacle is surely now a dead hand, which one should no longer let dominate our short years of life—oh to dwindle them out here, with all these gaps, & abbreviations! Always to catch trains, always to waste time, to sit here & wait for Leonard to come in, to spend hours standing at the box of type with Margery, to wonder what its all for—when, alternatively, I might go & hear a tune, or have a look at a picture, or find out something at the British Museum, or go adventuring among human beings. Sometimes I should merely walk down Cheapside. But now I’m tied, imprisoned, inhibited. All I can do is to pretend I’m writing something very important, or reading with a view to a book I shall never write. (I’m letting my pen fling itself on paper like a leopard starved for blood—& I must wash & dress—so do not, in years to come, look too harshly upon this first outcry, the expression of many yet unheard). This is the pith of my complaint. For ever to be suburban. L. I don’t think minds any of this as much as I do. But then, Lord! (not Lord in K.M.’s serious sense) what I owe to him! What he gives me! Still, I say, surely we could get more from life than we do—isn’t he too much of a Puritan, of a disciplinarian, doesn’t he through birth & training accept a drastic discipline too tamely, or rather, with too Spartan a self control? There is, I suppose, a very different element in us; my social side, his intellectual side. This social side is very genuine in me. Nor do I think it reprehensible. It is a piece of jewellery I inherit from my mother—a joy in laughter, something that is stimulated, not selfishly wholly or vainly, by contact with my friends. And then ideas leap in me. Moreover, for my work now, I want freer intercourse, wider intercourse—& now, at 41, having done a little work, I get my wages partly in invitations. I might know people. In Richmond this is impossible. Either we have arduous parties at long intervals, or I make my frenzied dashes up to London, & leave, guiltily, as the clock strikes 11.

But let me bethink me that L. is very hard worked: the present state must go on till next Christmas, & to be forever worrying is fatal & cruel & only makes the question harder to settle amicably. Still I own I am depressed & baffled."
1923.07.08,"So we went to dine with the Myers; & it is now the hottest day of the year. & I don’t want to grumble; having seen many people—Anyhow, if a move is to be made, it can’t be till the autumn, or new year. Anyhow I am content at present, or moderately so. I am alive; rather energetic; asked to write for 2 American papers, & so on & so on. I never said that Vanity Fair has invited me & the Dial & new Broom as well as the Nation & the Times, so that I can’t help thinking myself about as successful journalistically as any woman of my day. But that is not saying much. I wish I could write The Hours as freely & vigorously as I scribble Freshwater, a Comedy. Its a strange thing how arduous I find my novels; & yet Freshwater is only spirited fun; & The Hours has some serious merit. I should like though to get speed & life into it. I got tempted, a week ago, into comedy writing, & have scribb⁠[l]⁠ed daily, & trust it will be done tomorrow. Yet I feel some reluctance to screw myself to The Hours again. Never mind. Should it bore me, into the fire with it!

The very thought of a fire is uncomfortable. I have said nothing about the weather for ages. How May & June melted into thin cold cloud. They were plucked from the year. By the way, on re-reading this book I resolved to write rather more carefully, & to record conversations verbatim. It is difficult to write carefully, as I am always having at this book by way of killing time, filling time, or writing out the fidgets. As for recording conversations, nothing is harder. Let me try.

Desmond

Janet

Leonard

Virginia

Scene tea-time Friday, 6th.



Desmond I can’t stay to dinner. No I must get back to my mother. She’s become quite an old woman. She was thrown 10 yards by the cab, & though no bones were broken, she has lost her memory. She tells the same story over again. She never stops talking about her accident. I am taking her down to the Isle of Wight.

Enter Janet I was determined to come—

Virginia And is the Forest very lovely?

Desmond All the oaks are being devoured by caterpillars. Yes, you can hear a pattering sound beneath the trees. That is the caterpillars munching. And if they eat a tree for 3 years, it is dead.

Janet O how dreadful! I do hope that hasn’t happened to our oak trees.

Leonard Well, Desmond have we settled our quarrel.

V. (explaining to Janet) Theyre rival’s you see. Desmond edits the New Statesman. They steal each others reviewers.

Leonard Desmond steals my reviewers.

Desmond Oh, the quarrel’s all made up—I say who have you got this week:

L. Bertie & Graves.

Desmond Oh thats all right. My Bertie comes next week.

So some gossip about the Nation.

Desmond Have you read the second number of the Adelphi? Have you read Murry “I have been a miserable sinner (acting & striking his breast). I have lied, I have swindled. I have laughed at what I love; but now I am speaking the truth.” He’s like a revivalist preacher. I saw Sullivan last week end. He says he doesn’t agree with Murry. Hes not one of the push. He says you couldn’t think him sincere if you only judged him by this evidence. But he says he is sincere.

Le. Its John Bull over again. “If every reader will get another reader”—& that on top of his revelations about Katherine’s death!

V. I dont object to opening the heart, but I do object to finding it empty. Murry has nothing whatever to reveal. Yet he has sold his reticence.

Janet Dear dear, dear dear! He talks about his wife’s death? Dear, dear.

Desmond Mortimer has done Katherine this week. But he’s not got to the bottom of her. Nor did I.

V. I say Desmond, whatever the reason may be, the Hawk gets daily better & better. Its never been so good. People talk about the Hawk: about reading the paper for the Hawk.

Des Oh come Virginia, it wasn’t as bad as all that before!

more gossip between Desmond & Leonard.

Janet (to me)"
1923.07.17,"I forget now, it being Tuesday 17th July what Janet said. It was a hot day, I remember. Let me try another conversation. But there have been so many. Shall we attempt old Birrell the other night?

Persons: Aug. Birrell: Francis B. Tony B. L. & V.

Scene 70 Elm Park Road: first dark pannelled dining room; later the library, a room just beneath the grass of a large garden. Books all round; regular, back to back books in series & editions. Framed autographs on walls. One from Lamb. “Mary has got to leave me—She is going to be ill. Tell Forster.”

A. Birrell Oh, thats dreadful.

He is a large fine untidy old man, in blue shirt, grey hair, no tie. Very vigorous & manly in the Victorian style.

I went to hear Dickens read at Liverpool (he gave away prizes). He had to name a girl called Weller—Miss Weller, he said: & I assure you there were Bishops, Mayors, Judges—every sort of person—& they roared with laughter. No other human being could have done that by just mentioning one of his own characters. You would have taken him for an actor—or a seafaring man. He had a blue coat; & a great necktie.—a wonderful looking man.

V. (obediently, filially) And Thackeray, did you know?

A.B. No, never saw him.

V. (” ”) You should write your memoirs.

A.B. Good gracious no.

F.B. I can read all biographies—all childhoods anyhow.

A.B. (somehow got on to the Harmsworths). I knew Alfred, the father—an old Bailey Barrister—a nice chap, who may have drunk a little too much—may have. Well he was Vice President of a Club wh. met up at St Johns Wood, the Eyre Arms, I think, called what was it? The Sylvan, because they met in a wood—& I went sometimes & we debated—all young fellows. One night walking on the Embankment I met Alfred, very down on his luck he was. I’m going to die he said, & I’ve done nothing. I’m leaving my wife, & six children (I think he said) & I’ve done nothing. Well, I had an inspiration. My dear chap, I said, you’ve done the only thing you could do, & dont you worry, I said. Take my word for it, one of those boys’ll do well. They’ll look after their mother, I said; & so we parted. He died in a fortnight. And sure enough, the great Alfred got going, & made a fortune ever so soon, & every penny went to the old lady. One night I was splashed with mud from head to foot in Piccadilly, & there was the old lady, sitting in her barouche, furs on her knee, two horses, driving off to Berkely Street. Always his mother came first. When I knew them there was a smell of cold mutton & boots all over the house. But I saw what a remarkable woman she was. She controlled everything. And now she’s still alive, & Lady Nth. has married my old friend Hudson.

(Somehow we got on to Hardy’s novels; how he makes a woman confess she’s had a bastard on her wedding night; upon wh. the husband packs his bag & goes to the South Seas).

A.B. vehemently—You’re all children. You dont know what your talking about. I’d have done the same. I’d have packed my bag anyhow. Silly woman! She should have told him in the cornfield—It was a silly disgusting thing to do. Its not a question of morality. Morality dont change. Its human nature.

F.B. My dear old Pater you’re talking nonsense.

(They were very affectionate: Francis helping him to address Lady Wimbome’s telegram correctly, which I don’t think he could have done without).

V. Tennyson is a great poet.

A.B. Certainly he’s a poet, not a great poet. Hallam was a donkey. Shall never forget his telegram to Eleanor: Passed away peacefully at 3.45. Liked Austin’s book. Hallam carried his mother on his back. It was thought so beautiful. So he never had a profession & didn’t want one. He was a lazy man. Tennyson was a very direct creature—didn’t like second marriages, didn’t like Lionel’s dying at sea—no sod to visit—very old fashioned, conventional views.

(Told the story of Ellen Terry running round the bedroom naked, & Watts going to Harcourt & saying “It frightened me.” “It wouldn’t have frightened me” said Harcourt, very loud & bluff.)

Tony Birrell in a high shrill falling voice, he squints rather, is pale, wears spectacles, & suddenly disappears to range about the garden alone.

I had a letter from Hester the other day. She was coming here, but the motor car broke down!! (as if this were a surprising piece of news).

F.B. Tony, you look after the drinks don’t you.

Tony goes & fidgets at the sideboard.

In the end A.B. gave me Boswell’s Corsica, & wrote “to Victoria Woolf…” then wrote to apologise. An interesting evening, highly Victorian, well furnished with drink & cigars & carpets & leather chairs. Old B. is a storyteller, & has had his day: been a figure in society, yet remains non conformist; not, I think, a very serious writer, but a good Victorian all round humane literary type, sunned by various kinds of life, as we aren’t now—barrister, politician, essayist. He is anxious to write for L.

Persons: Vivien Eliot, Torn; Sunday tea.

Tom. Put brandy in your tea, Vivien.

No, no, Tom.

Yes. You must put a tea spoonful of brandy in your tea.

Vivien. Oh all right—I don’t want it.

V. One doesn’t like taking medicine before one’s friends.

L. What about the great question—the Adelphi? Whats to be said?

Vvn What indeed? (she’s very nervous, very spotty, much powdered, her first drive, overdressed, perhaps.)

Tom I have put a note in the Criterion. I don’t understand this business about Wells & life—this confusion that literature is not life.

V. Shall you write.

Tom. Oh dear no. Murry is now comfortable for the first time. He’s in the society he likes.

Vivien I’m living between him & Mr Joyce. Mr Joyce is very nice.

Tom His wife is very nice too—& the children. Giorgio is away in la Banque Generale (he pronounces French always with great care & pride).

V. I’ve been setting up your poem. Its a good poem.

Vivien a damned good poem, did you say?

V. Well, you’ve improved what I said. But it is a d——d good poem.

Cetera disunt.

My impression being that they were nervous, contrasted us with them, & liked us & our surroundings. And on the drive home, I daresay Vivien said “Why can’t we get on as the Woolves do?” I think they meant us to feel them in sympathy together. Certainly they were lighter, more affectionate."
1923.07.22,"A great many conversations to record: dined with Mortimer & Schofield Thayer the other night & went on with them to Mary’s.

Mortimer is Oxford, & thus not nearly so easy to come to terms with as Sebastian [Sprott] for instance. He is all angle & polish. Wears a swallow tail white waistcoat; wants brilliancy not intimacy, is half a dandy.

M. Its far better to write reviews than secondrate novels.

L. I dont agree.

V. I should like good criticism.

S.T. Surely it would be much better if Rebecca West wrote criticism.

He was a cautious hardheaded American, edited the Dial. Like Mortimer he buys modern pictures; had met Roger outside the Nat. Gal. & said “Surely, Mr Fry? I have the advantage of you Mr Fry: I know you through your caricatures.” & so on.

But the talk was too formal & too conventional to bear writing out; or I cant do it; let me see, how did it go:

Adelphi abused.

Murry’s writing abused. We tried to explain our dislike of K.’s stories.

M. I used to have a boy to wait, & now only have an old woman

V. But this is delicious (chicken in sauce) These are exquisite—china fruit from Venice.

A good account of flying from T⁠[hayer].

S.T. The pilot sayd he wdn’t start. The company had sold three seats instead of two. But I had taken my passage 10 days before. I wouldnt budge. Some luggage was left. One man took his dachs. But we felt overweighted. Then we got above a storm. One leant over & saw the lightning dashing up at one’s face. It was terrible. I looked at my feet. One man kept going to the side & being sick. The other kept saying It is bad It is bad. And we all knew we were over weighted. Suddenly the engines stopped. We pitched up & down. We expected the whole thing to crash. The dog sat quite calm. Then after 10 minutes the engine began again. Towns looked like the handle of that salt cellar. Never again, no. And the pilot said he’d been guiding with one hand & fumbling with the other & suddenly touched the right spring by chance, & the engine started. But we might just as well have dashed to the ground.
"
1923.07.28,"These days before going, as we do on Wednesday are too dissipated for serious reading writing living or thinking. Variable as a barometer to phychical [sic] changes, my wits flutter & frizzle & I can get no work out of them because, somehow, they’ve picked up the rumour of a move to Sussex. Indeed, I’ve been gadding (to parody I’ve been roaming which we heard at Tancred, Mrs Lyttelton’s intolerably tedious play the other night) gadding too much for the health of my five wits. They soon jangle. Very soon I find myself out of talk, a disillusioned spectator, for instance, of Clive, Mary & Mortimer, of Mary’s great evening party, of old Roger & old Margery [Fry], of Tidmarsh with young kitten Rylands verging on the albino. However, I’ve enjoyed it too, in its rather agitating way, this half year has kept me on the hop. I like that; agitating though it is. I’ve taken my fences, as I say, & got some good gallops for my trouble. I have also to remind myself that risks imply falls. There are incidents that disquiet me. I have been peevish, exacting, excited, & moody. In these general terms I refer to a certain degree of society: to something stirring us to live more stormily than last year I think. Never settle, is my principle in life: & I try to put it in practice, but in talk more than in action I daresay. My theory is that at 40 one either increases the pace or slows down. Needless to say which I desire. But, to be just, my activity is also mental. I’m working variously & with intention. I’ve pulled through my Chaucer chapter; & written ahead at The Hours, & fill in spare space with ‘serious’ reading for my book, reading with pen & notebook. It encourages me to feel that all this reading has an end in view. In five years, I shall have fagged out a good book from it, I hope; a rough, but vigorous statue testifying before I die to the great fun & pleasure my habit of reading has given me. And I’m going to work hard, hard, hard, in every sense at Rodmell. I am going to tackle those old essays of mine, & see whether by drastic & spirited treatment they can be made worth reprinting. Courage & decision are my need, I think—to speak out, without mincing. At the moment I feel myself farely free of foreign influence: Eliot, or whoever it might be: & this I must prize, for unless I am myself, I am nobody.

As for the press, we have finished Tom, much to our relief. He will be published this August by Marjorie; & altogether we have worked at full speed since May. & that is I’m persuaded the root & source & origin of all health & happiness, provided of course that one rides work as a man rides a great horse, in a spirited & independent way; not a drudge, but a man with spurs in his heels. So I don’t force myself any more to read against my will. I’m grown epicure in my middle age. Nevertheless, some compulsion is needed for the Greek chapter, which I must investigate at Rodmell. Also I shall explore—take a motor bus ride along the downs one day—see Steyning, & Arundel & so on. I much regret not having seen Windsor this spring. But I have at least ordered my French grammar. For plans, I have immediately to write a dialogue on Conrad: so must read for that too. Fame? Is not Clive writing an article on me? Has not Bunny praised me in the Dial? Does not Madame Logé propose to translate The Voyage Out?—But fame “comes slowly up this way”. I am never praised except by my contemporaries or youngers. When Wells picks young writers, he neglects me. There are many other matters of importance to discuss at Rodmell though: the Nation; L.’s work; Hogarth House. Nessa last night, sitting in the Square, recommended Haverstock Hill."
1923.08.06,"I have ruined my mornings work by making bread & buns, which require constant voyages to the kitchen. The demon then always suggests that I shall read The Hours. Sheer weak dribble it seems to me (read in these circumstances). My comfort is that I can have at it in any way I like; & if it still goes wrong, to the fire with it. Nor do I think it wrong altogether. Whenever there is a breach in my content, all disparaging criticisms creep in; meanly enough, the good ones keep off.

We went over to Charleston yesterday. Although thinking quite well of ourselves, we were not well received by the painters. There they sat like assid⁠[u]⁠ous children at a task in a bedroom—Roger, Nessa, & Duncan; Roger on chair in foreground; Nessa on sofa, Duncan on bed. In front of them was one jar of flowers, & one arrangement of still live. Roger was picking out his blue flower very brightly. For some reason, the talk was not entirely congenial. I suspect myself of pertness & so on. Clive was sitting in the drawing room window reading Dryden.

A very good edition—I want to ask your husband some questions—Will he take an article…. V. O I thought your Lytton article very good … Van. Tea’s ready—V. What am I to do with my cigarette?

Hollyhocks, decapitated, swam in a bowl; there was a loaf for tea, & a long slab of cake. Roger, I cant help thinking has become a little querulous with years. His grievances torment him; he talks of them too much. After tea, Angelica had her dolls’ tea party in the window, & beat Clive, & when he cried, ran of her own accord & picked him a flower—which was a sensitive womanly act. She is sensitive—minds being laughed at (as I do). She said she wanted a ‘slide’ in her hair. “Dont laugh at me” she said, petulantly, to Roger.

I should say that the weather is perfect, soft as a cushion, blue to the heart. A gospel caravan has just pitched its tent near, & the other night 10 young men bawled hymns…. But I am laying [sic] my mind wander to The Hours. Now its a strange thing that if I have no gift for novel writing, yet it should so absorb me—I cant diagnose my own case—which reminds me that I’ve started upon the revision of my old articles; & feel rather charitable to that side of my faculty. Leonard is at this moment beginning again his book, which I daresay he has not touched since last Christmas."
1923.08.17,"The question I want to debate here is the question of my essays; & how to make them into a book. The brilliant idea has just come to me of embedding them in Otway conversation. The main advantage would be that I could then comment, & add what I had had to leave out, or failed to get in e.g. the one on George Eliot certainly needs an epilogue. Also to have a setting for each would ‘make a book’; & the collection of articles is in my view an inartistic method. But then this might be too artistic: it might run away with me; it will take time. Nevertheless I should very much enjoy it. I should graze nearer my own individuality. I should mitigate the pomposity & sweep in all sorts of trifles. I think I should feel more at my ease. So I think a trial should be made. The first thing to do is to get ready a certain number of essays;—There could be an introductory chapter. A family which reads the papers. The thing to do wd. be to envelop each essay in its own atmosphere. To get them into a current of life, & so to shape the book; to get a stress upon some main line—but what the line is to be, I can only see by reading them through. No doubt fiction is the prevailing theme. Anyhow the book shd end with modern lit:

1 Old Memoirs"
1923.08.29,"I’ve been battling for ever so long with ‘The Hours’, which is proving one of my most tantalising & refractory of books. Parts are so bad, parts so good; I’m much interested; can’t stop making it up yet—yet. What is the matter with it? But I want to freshen myself, not deaden myself, so will say no more. Only I must note this odd symptom; a conviction that I shall go on, see it through, because it interests me to write it.

Clive & Mary came. So did Nick [Bagenal]; so did Mrs Jones; & we went to Seaford too. An odd instinct informed me that Mr Jones was non-existent. Who then could Hugh be? He is the child of Philip Morrell! So that puzzle has fitted itself together oddly enough. Mrs J. is too self-conscious to be a widow. She has no past to deplore—an uneasy future, under my eye. The little boy has strange blue eyes—but no look of the old ram. Nick’s attachment to Barbara is very marked. By virtue of her astounding merits he is admitted among the great, in whom he still believes. He brought several pears & a melon. This melon, Molly Hamilton ate. She was windblown & breathless. She is tart, not embittered. She is brave; has herself in hand. Faces more facts every night than I do in a year. Of course her touch is not sensitive; vigorous rather, &, as I say, she licks the gilt off any scrap of gingerbread. I notice this in her descriptions. She never seems to enjoy people completely. But she admires me. I was ‘nice’ to her indeed; quite simple, quite unaffected, made no attempt to impose myself. But then, I thought, perhaps it is more amusing to be brilliant. One cannot condemn it utterly. It carries further.

Clive has an egg—a turkeys egg—for a head now—quite bald, unashamedly bald; never a hair will grow any more. Mary was shrinking, childlike, not brilliant, not attending when I read my play, but very anxious to say the right thing. She worships her canary. She pressed me to write about him. What view would I take—about this last phase, for instance, the Byronic? Chocolates she brought; she wore tight grey Alpaca, with large buttons, & she powdered & re-powdered in the drawing room. I cannot write out any verbatim talk; but will try again. Going to the dogs was discussed:"
1923.08.30,"I was called, I think to cut wood; we have to shape logs for the stove, for we sit in the lodge every night, & my goodness, the wind! Last night we looked at the meadow trees, flinging about, & such a weight of leaves that every brandish seems the end. Only a strewing of leaves from the lime tree, though, this morning. I read such a white dimity rice puddingy chapter of Mrs Gaskell at midnight in the gale “Wives & Daughters”—I think it must be better than Old Wives Tale all the same. You see, I’m thinking furiously about Reading & Writing. I have no time to describe my plans. I should say a good deal about The Hours, & my discovery; how I dig out beautiful caves behind my characters; I think that gives exactly what I want; humanity, humour, depth. The idea is that the caves shall connect, & each comes to daylight at the present moment—Dinner!"
1923.09.05,"Here is the usual half hour to be filled before dinner, & such a mass to stuff it with as would burst a whole day. K.M. used to write all day, she told me; poor Katherine, I’m always inclined to say unpleasant things about her, for some reason: The Adelphi I suppose. Our week end was Francis Birrell & Raymond Mortimer. Leonard says that F. is 3 quarters grown up, Tony F. spills out the whole contents of his head like a nice little boy; never stops talking—And what was it about?

About the Tennysons & his mother; my mother (The B⁠[irrell]’s didn’t much like her: they had a culte for Minny) his father; aunts & so on.

“I wish I had distinguished Aunts” said Mortimer.

Rather obviously he hasnt. He is a curious half breed. An Oxford young man, inclined to smartness, dress & culture. His soul is uneasy in Cambridge company. He squirms a little visibly. One is not sure how far one likes him. He flatters. He is not very simple, candid, or talkative, like chatterbox F. who is as open as daylight.

My father is a solicitor—lives at Exmouth, & has really been a bachelor since the death of my mother. She died when I was quite small. No I dont mind being an only child at all. I am quite happy. I never look ahead. If I had two thousand a year, I should never write. I should buy pictures & travel.

We discussed writing novels on Asheham Hill. He had read the V⁠[oyage]. O⁠[ut]. when it came out; & thought it frightfully good. N⁠[ight]. & D⁠[ay]. he couldn’t get through at first, but has now. J⁠[acob’]⁠s R⁠[oom] the contemporary novel most to his liking. But he cant write novels himself. Doesnt see why he should; has no originality. Likes pictures perhaps best, because theres Picasso in painting & no one to match him in writing.

“Palaeolithic men must have lived here. They lived an extraordinary kind of life” we agreed in Asheham Hollow. “Now & then the clever ones realised that they were human.” At the same time we were talking about Clive Bell who had been to luncheon, talking a great deal. I have a culte for Bloomsbury, said Raymond (we have had to drop titles) “He seems to me a perfectly happy & developed man. He is clever, & he enjoys life too.” I said “He has renounced a good deal all the same—his great book for instance. And his happiness is partly pose”. Still, I admitted, he’s a good fellow—he’s done very well. Then Vanessa. “She has such a lovely voice, & then shes very lovely to look at. Her personality too is very impressive,” he said. In short “You can’t imagine what it has been to me getting to know Bloomsbury. Theyre different human beings from any I thought possible.” Today I have a nice, I think, letter from him. “I’d seem gushing if I told you how much I enjoyed my visit…. I’m frightfully flattered, & something more than flattered by your friendship, & only hope that when you see through my cleverness, & are thoroughly bored with it, you won’t be bored with me as well…. Anyhow Floreat Bloomsburga!”

This hits it off very well; my reserves & doubts, his self-consciousness & flattery is it?—let us call it “enthusiasm.”

A great deal of time was spent in discussing Nation affairs—the Desmond row; & their position as reviewers. L. is trying to get Bertie & Clive to join in & make the position clear. Undoubtedly the Nation breeds a good many mosquitoes for us. There’s Molly this week, refusing to sign her article. And I’m slightly dashed by the reception of my Conrad conversation, which has been purely negative—No one has mentioned it. I dont think M⁠[ortimer]. or B⁠[irrell]. quite approved. Never mind; to be dashed is always the most bracing treatment for me. A cold douche should be taken (& generally is) before beginning a book. It invigorates; makes one say “Oh all right. I write to please myself,” & so go ahead. It also has the effect of making me more definite & outspoken in my style, which I imagine all to the good. At any rate, I began for the 5th but last time, I swear, what is now to be called The Common Reader; & did the first page quite moderately well this morning. After all this stew, its odd how, as soon as I begin, a new aspect, never all this 2 or 3 years thought of, at once becomes clear; & gives the whole bundle a new proportion. To curtail, I shall really investigate literature with a view to answering certain questions about ourselves—Characters are to be merely views: personality must be avoided at all costs. I’m sure my Conrad adventure taught me this. Directly you specify hair, age, &c something frivolous, or irrelevant, gets into the book—Dinner!"
1923.09.11,"Here we are back from The Knoll, Studland. It was reckoned that we could have got to France in less time, reckoned at Charleston last week (on a hot September afternoon, with the children putting the kitten in a dead tree, which Duncan carried about as if it had been a Christmas tree; & then I read my play, & then I got excited, & then we bicycled home—all these things I should like to remember). I wanted to observe Lydia as a type for Rezia; & did observe one or two facts. It was very hot at Lulworth, & we sat with the sun in our eyes on a verandah having tea. Suddenly she got cross, frowned, complained of the heat, seemed about to cry, precisely like a child of six. She was concerned to know what Leonard meant by coupling her with me among the “sillies”. It means that you can both be beaten, Maynard said. Maynard is grown very gross & stout, especially when he wraps his leopard spotted dressing gown tight round his knees & stands in front of the fire. I was looking at him censoriously, through the eyes of good M. Murry (4th no. of the Adelphi devoted to abuse of Mortimer & Bunny). He has a queer swollen eel like look, not very pleasant. But his eyes are remarkable, & as I truly said when he gave me some pages of his new book to read, the process of mind there displayed is as far ahead of me as Shakespeare’s. True, I don’t respect it so much. But to continue. The poet Rylands was there & Mortimer. Dady’s hair (he became Dady at 10 a.m. Monday at Poole station) is precisely the colour & consistency of the husk of straw—that thin glistening fabric which one splits off the stalk of straw. Add to this a blue cornflower coloured tweed suit, his apple red face, & blue eyes & you have—well, merely a corn flower to me, but to Raymond the most intoxicatingly beautiful young man that it is possible to imagine. Unfortunately (for R.) Dady did not share these views. He, being honest Cambridge, puts R. down for “a very clever Oxford man”. L. is inclined to agree; indeed he calls R. “slimy”. He patted Dady, enclosed him, as he sat on the floor in his arms, praised his beauty to his face; & one must agree, I think, that all exhibitions of s——feeling have something silly, mawkish, about them, though why I can’t say. Anyhow, R. had a cold in his nose, & his nose is his worst feature, square at the tip, like something that has to stand on a table. His features are not good; his hair dark; & his manners either a little too clever or too flattering. Yet, I liked him better this week end than last. Such are the elements of our party. I was interested to observe, & not much caring, as indeed happens oftener than not nowadays, to make a splash of my own. For one thing, we are grown so old now; & the young are so literal in their respect. We motored to Lulworth on Sunday, or rather to Warbarrow, which we climbed & walked 5 miles over the down. My shoes interfered with my pleasure rather. But I thought of the year 1830, & how most of England then looked as this coast looked, bays with their sweep untenanted, only coastguards & gray cottages, & rowing boats making off to little ships—And then I caught a view or two which I’ve no doubt will keep for some years & then be used: the red heather & water—the mediterranean aspect—but by the bye I must remember how curiously my week end transitory feeling conditioned all this: as if I were seeing something isolated, from a train. The clear water was very moving to me, with the pale stones showing under it like jelly fish. Lulworth of course was all skittles, & men playing in a yard; & people parading in front of a wall which, like an Italian wall, encloses the headland. An odd haze came down, so that we saw nothing distinctly: only outlines. Then we stopped, Maynard liking I think to be showman, at Bindon Abbey, having just before seen the old Manor house where Tess slept, or lived. At Bindon Lydia lay in her pink jacket with the white fur in a Bishops tomb—a kind of shaped tank sunk in the earth on the way up to the Calvary, & got up with leaves sticking to her cloak. She lay quite still, acting death, her muscular dancers legs in white silk stockings lying with the soles of the feet touching, & Maynard & I standing by. What did she think about? About Maynard, & her death, & what would happen before? Heaven knows. Bindon is all grass & trees & long stretches of water, like those at Hampton Court. We sat on the mound of the Calvary, the cross being gone, & Maynard talked about palaeolithic man & an interesting theory about the age of man—how the beginning of history about 5,000 b.c. is only the beginning of another lap in the race; others, many others, having been run previously & obliterated by ice ages. Meanwhile Raymond took his Dady along the side walks by the fish ponds. It is a damp romantic place; & one wh. perhaps I shall never see again, as I told L. I had an odd feeling that it is queer to find such places lying unknown in the country, inland. I can’t get hold of it now. I am perhaps encouraged by Proust to search out & identify my feelings, but I have always felt this kind of thing in great profusion, only not tried to capture it, or perhaps lacked skill & confidence. To return:—Dady has an ingratiating manner of pawing ladies old enough to be his mother. He threw out an idea that he might join the Press. The printing mania has come upon him & Sebastian, & it looks as if we might now start a Cambridge branch;—he asked, lightly, for he is not emphatic & very happy I should think, with all his interests & successes, & no inhibitions & good health, & money in prospect, & an editor to print his poems, & a year more at Cambridge, & a possible fellowship & so forth—he asked lightly whether he might lodge with us in the holidays, & pay his way by working the press. So you see how the future branches & extends: I mean there are ways down the forest; roads leading to right & left hitherto unseen.

It was hot & prosy in London. I bought China at Heal’s, & we lunched with Hubert H⁠[enderson].—a small, testy, unheroic man, vaguely on the look out for offence, & suspecting I think our superior vitality, & longing for a compliment, which being honest at the moment, I could not give him. He ought to have stuck to Cambridge, as, I suspect, he begins to think. He is less of a personage than I thought. Once the flush of the adventure is past, he finds himself hard put to it to keep his end up. Maynard is his standby. Bloomsbury his pest. He wants safe, charming articles, like Molly’s childhood series.

Any really good article, said L., is bound to be disliked intensely & liked intensely.

H.H. didn’t much agree to this. He thought they could be liked by everyone. He was disappointed by Lytton, who gets £40 for 15,00 words, & I think by me. Left to himself, he would soon make The Nation into the Westminster Gazette. But I don’t pretend to care very profoundly. Unfortunately, Desmond has cut up crusty, & L. is landed with F. B⁠[irrell]. for whom he must provide £150 p.A. Mortimer I think, descends safely but a little ingloriously on the New Statesman side of the fence. And Bertie [Russell] says he will resign."
1923.09.18,"Leonard’s day in London, & left with 30 minutes before I walk off to meet him I may as well write here. We have had visitors—Lytton & the Partridges, unexpectedly; then Nessa & Duncan; then Morgan for the week end. There are times when I want no one, times when I relish the commonest animated slug. I am worn smooth with talk at the moment, & so did not come to grips with my friends, as I should have done. Yet how good, kind, tender, & clever we all are! Chiefly I remember sitting on the wall of the public house with Duncan & discussing his painting. He said he was trying to simplify; he wants I think, to express something very abstract simply. His own loveliness seems to him now negligible. “Nessa is a happy artist” he said in the bus (I went in to Lewes). I am a stupid artist she said. She has none of these changes. She does not think things out. Sometimes I am quite ready not to paint for a long time. I suppose he is intellectual, as I suppose I am; & she more instinctive. Yet she changes too. They notice old women & babies all the time. We stood in the High Street, & saw a man drive out of the White Hart, close clipped as a convict, wearing a hard grey bowler, & driving a high stepping piebald. Duncan could not imagine what his life was. So I walked home. Not much talk of interest with Lytton. He pounced on our books. Oh books, books! he cried, & carried off Mortimer’s Oxford Circus. Fame has made him confident, taken from him I suppose, some charm, turned it to strength of some kind. I always feel a kind of mass now behind his view of his own writing. The French at the Monastery had been so enthusiastic about Racine. That set him up, & made it needless to praise his articles in the Nation, which are not, so we think, good.

Very well. We all grow old; grow stocky; lose our pliancy & impressionability. Even Morgan seems to me to be based on some hidden rock. Talking of Proust & Lawrence he said he’d prefer to be Lawrence; but much rather would be himself. We discussed his novels. I don’t think I am a novelist, he said. Suddenly I said “No, I don’t think you are” Ah! he exclaimed, eagerly, interested, not dashed. But L. denied this. “I’m not at all downcast about my literary career”, he said. I think he has made up his mind that he has much to fall back on. He is aloof, serene, a snob, he says, reading masterpieces only. We had a long gossip about servants. He found wasps in the mint sauce. This made Agnes drop the dish & go off leaving the dining room door open. Mrs Forster was cold to her for some days. “She will begin to scream & die of appendicitis” he said. And so to Miss Grant Duff & his quarrel in Alexandria. But it grows cold & dark; I shall walk off to meet L."
1923.10.15,"This last entry seems long ago. And I meant to record for psychological purposes that strange night when I went to meet Leonard & did not meet him. What an intensity of feeling was pressed into those hours! It was a wet windy night; & as I walked back across the field I said Now I am meeting it; now the old devil has once more got his spine through the waves, (but I cannot re-capture really). And such was the strength of my feeling that I became physically rigid. Reality, so I thought, was unveiled. And there was something noble in feeling like this; tragic, not at all petty. Then cold white lights went over the fields; & went out; & I stood under the great trees at Iford waiting for the lights of the bus. And that went by; & I felt lonelier. There was a man with a barrow walking into Lewes, who looked at me. But I could toy with, at least control all this, until suddenly, after the last likely train had come in I felt it was intolerable to sit about, & must do the final thing, which was to go to London. Off I rode, without much time, against such a wind; & again I had a satisfaction in being matched with powerful things, like wind & dark. I battled, had to walk; got on; drove ahead; dropped the torch; picked it up, & so on again without any lights. Saw men & women walking together; thought, you’re safe & happy I’m an outcast; took my ticket; had 3 minutes to spare, & then, turning the corner of the station stairs, saw Leonard, coming along, bending rather, like a person walking very quick, in his mackintosh. He was rather cold & angry (as, perhaps was natural). And then, not to show my feelings, I went outside & did something to my bicycle. Also, I went back to the ticket office, & said to the humane man there, “Its all right. My husband caught the last train. Give me back my fare” which he did. And I got the money more to set myself right with Leonard than because I wanted it. All the way back we talked about a row (about reviewers) at the office; & all the time I was feeling My God, thats over. I’m out of that. Its over. Really, it was a physical feeling, of lightness & relief & safety. & yet there was too something terrible behind it—the fact of this pain, I suppose; which continued for several days—I think I should feel it again if I went over that road at night; & it became connected with the deaths of the miners, & with Aubrey Herbert’s death next day. But I have not got it all in, by any means.

We have been dealing with domestic rows; a triumphant solution for us; since Lottie is declared fit for all work by her doctor; but the expense of spirit is too great to be worth while. We lunch on trays. Marjorie [Joad] does not much like it, but submits. Marjorie has her Champagne love affair with Ralph, now developed into an attack of influenza, as I thought likely. She is a cold honest woman; prepared for the worst. I like her literal good sense, though her spirit does not bounce & spring as one could like. Its her drawl thats the worst of her. And then? My first activity has been to see houses. So far I have seen the outsides of two. And the problem is a difficult one. Its my wish to live in London, no one elses. How far can this wish bear the weight of the removal, the expense, the less pleasant surroundings, & so on? But I shall go on steadily, looking, & I hope, working. Here we are tight wedged in printing & editing. People come (Madge & Janet yesterday for 4 hours, leaving me with a brain like a wrung dish cloth) And we have Dadie in prospect.

This young man with hair like the husk of corn, says he wishes to devote his life to the Hogarth Press, & is writing a letter to that effect to Leonard. This will begin in June. He shall be a partner, & take over the work; & we shall supervise, & by degrees it will become more & more important, & we shall be the benefactors of our age; & have a shop, & enjoy the society of the young, & rummage & splash in the great bran pie, & so never, never stop working with brains or fingers or toes till our limbs fly asunder & the heart sprays off into dust. Such is my fancy picture—But I must write a careful letter to Frances Cornford & so have no time.

I am now in the thick of the mad scene in Regents Park. I find I write it by clinging as tight to fact as I can, & write perhaps 50 words a morning. This I must re-write some day. I think the design is more remarkable than in any of my books. I daresay I shan’t be able to carry it out. I am stuffed with ideas for it. I feel I can use up everything I’ve ever thought. Certainly, I’m less coerced than I’ve yet been. The doubtful point is I think the character of Mrs Dalloway. It may be too stiff, too glittering & tinsely—But then I can bring innumerable other characters to her support. I wrote the 100th page today. Of course, I’ve only been feeling my way into it—up till last August anyhow. It took me a year’s groping to discover what I call my tunnelling process, by which I tell the past by instalments, as I have need of it. This is my prime discovery so far; & the fact that I’ve been so long finding it, proves, I think, how false Percy Lubbock’s doctrine is—that you can do this sort of thing consciously. One feels about in a state of misery—indeed I made up my mind one night to abandon the book—& then one touches the hidden spring. But lor’ love me! I’ve not re-read my great discovery, & it may be nothing important whatsoever. Never mind. I own I have my hopes for this book. I am going on writing it now till, honestly, I cant write another line—Journalism, everything, is to give way to it."
1923.11.03,"And now I’ve found a house 35 Woburn Square. Yes, shall I write that address often? Certainly I hope to. For me it would be worth £500 a year in pleasure. Think of the music I could hear, the people I could see, easily, unthinkingly. And then comes before me the prospect of walking through the city streets; starting off early, some day L.’s at the office, & walking say to Wapping; & then to tea at the office. Why this so obsesses my mind I don’t know. It was a beautiful clear November day, yesterday, when I went up & past our house (with green doors opposite the mews) & the squares with their regular houses, & their leafless trees, & people very clearly outlined filled me with joy. Indeed, it was so lovely in the Waterloo Road that it struck me that we were writing Shakespeare; by which I mean that when live people, seeming happy, produce an effect of beauty, & you dont have it offered as a work of art, but it seems a natural gift of theirs, then—what was I meaning?—somehow it affected me as I am affected by reading Shakespeare. No: its life; going on in these very beautiful surroundings. As for the house question I am solving it tonight in this fashion. We will take the house, live in our own flat upstairs—a most lovable & delightful little place; have Nelly to cook; let out the next floor to Saxon; Lottie shall do for him. Then Dady (I think, but am not sure) shall be lodged on the ground floor, entirely apart, with his own servant in the basement, & control of the press which is also lodged there. This seems to me a perfectly feasible solution of innumerable difficulties. Of course Marjorie remains. We broke Dadie to her two days ago. Leonard did it in so many words.

M. But I dont think I shall like that.

V. Did you dislike him?

M. I shant like being under him. He’d make me typewrite all day. And I suppose I should have to do what he told me?

L. He would be in the same position to you that we are.

M. I’ve never minded working under you. But this is the first time it happened. I’ve never been able to work with other people. I quarrelled with the headmistress, where I was before this.

(here is an example of the resolute, uncoloured honesty with which she behaves. But she did not show up otherwise in an attractive light—except that one can’t blame these unimaginative people for anything. She fears the loss of prestige. She is jealous, rather grasping, wants her way; but of course knows all this. That is the modern advantage.

But I have wasted my time drawing a plan of 35 on the opposite page. Nothing runs away with time like these house dreams. I must read Sophocles. After 20 years, I now know how to read Greek quick (with a crib in one hand) & with pleasure. This is for the eternal book. And my mind whips off to rents—how much can we ask for this house? I’m heartless about poor old Hogarth, where for 9 years we have been so secure. My mind whips away from Ka, & Altounyan, except that Ka was more like a sack of some of the commoner garden vegetables than ever. She has some worm gnawing at her, some persistent desire to impress us, with her romantic life, with Will’s romantic nature. Now there’s nothing human beings so quickly see as this motive, & none they more resent. For one thing, it implies some divergence of interest. She’s thinking not of you, but of how to impress you. More serious, though, is the dilution of her own interest, since she does not put her full weight on it, but only on half of it, thinking as she must, of making it impress. Her condescension is very curious. She is, or seems to be, one of the county; this she enjoys. But she is aware that being county doesn’t carry far in London, or even Richmond. Anyhow she tells too many stories about the strange figures who drive up to the Eagles Nest. Gordon Bottom ley, the Ranee of Sarawak. She dwells too much upon good Will’s passion for the conscription of natives by the French. All this protesting—thats whats at the bottom of it. But she was in some way very pathetic about Rupert. How Mrs Brooke had suddenly smiled at Mark as Ka had never seen her smile, exactly like Rupert. But if I hadn’t driven her off rather arbitrarily to the past, I don’t know how we should have got through the evening. I was glad to hear Leonard & Altounyan coming down. But I must descend to the basement, & see whats doing with Clive’s cover; which Leonard does for 8 hours daily."
1923.11.16,"No we didn’t take 35 Woburn Square, & the colour has gone out of it, & I dont want to write about it at the moment. I’m back from lunch Lady Colefax, meet Anrep at the Tate, tea Marjorie, discuss Ralph; Leonard back from Rodmell: & in rather a fritter, too much so to read Euripides. Indeed, I’ve been talking to Hugh Walpole—not an impressive man—a man who protests too much; an uneasy, prosperous vain man, who harbours some grudge against clever intellectuals & yet respects them, would like to be one. He has the look of a kindly solicitor or banker; red cheeks; very small bright eyes; a genial, but not profound or cordial manner. We talked of contemporary fame. He dwelt a good deal upon the different sets & critics, & how no book was good in the same parish. Somehow it all referred to him. An uninteresting mind, & really not able to cast a shadow even upon me. I did not feel knocked over, dashed to pieces, or anything very vividly, except that he was slightly in awe of me. There was old Lady Horner, with her grey big eyes very far apart in a face creased & crumpled like some old faded glove—an interesting subtle face; a mind worn down by society, into that kind of simple ease which enhances even small talk. I mean what she said was so freely & easily said that it had a manner with it. Spacious gardens & money have gone to it. Poor unhappy old woman—Am I sentimental to think so often of peoples unhappiness, or is it indirectly some tribute to myself? Lytton is very suave in such society⁠[;] sits in the shadow & now & then draws his sword effectively. Desmond of course does his jolly delightful tricks—eating & drinking meanwhile—acting an actress who cleans her arms like a fly in Nassau. As for Ly Colefax, there she sits painted & emphatic at the head of her table, broadcheeked, a little coarse, kindly glass eyed, affectionate to me almost, capable, apparently disinterested—I mean if she likes to listen to clever talk & to buy it with a lunch of four courses & good wine; I see no harm in it. Its a taste; not a vice. Off we streamed at 3. It amuses me to hear Ly Horner asking the servants to find out Lady Lovat’s telephone number. These free & easy ways remind me of Ly Bath, the Herberts—little accidents that impressed me years ago. Yet all it amounts to is that Ly Horner drives about London in a motor car, & has a sort of airiness instead of stuffiness about her. So to the Tate with Lytton. Lytton & I don’t need much preliminary.

Heres my book—Q.V. in French.

I daresay it reads better in French

He has almost bought a house near Hungerford, in the downs, but hesitates over the last £500. There are no drains & no water. Still I advised the leap, as I always advise leaps. And then there was Anrep, & his tinted floor, all raying out in greens & browns, like the waves of a sea; not a good metaphor, for it is really very compact, strong, & contained. Droves of schoolchildren kept sweeping over it. He explained it to me, smelling rather too much of whisky. Then he drove me to Waterloo. Now I lose interest in these facts, much as I do in writing my novels, & thus have to find a way out of saying them. Hugh Walpole wd. not be bored I suppose; therefore he is convincing. I’m now writing my Greek chapter in alternate bursts of hot & cold. It seems so superficial, & not worth foisting off upon a world provided with so much knowledge already. Yet I really must write a book about facts once in a way. And I cant keep grinding at fiction, which however goes easier this last lap than before. Here though I come lamely & softly & comfortably to a full stop. I must add that “I’ve broken off with Ralph. We had nowhere to meet. And its true—he ought to be in a park; not in restaurants. And I had two dreadful scenes with Cyril [Joad]. He wont let him come home, or let me stay away with him. I dont want to lie about it. So we’ve broken off”. Rather to her credit, I think, & certainly to our relief."
1923.12.03,"Back from Rodmell; unable to settle in; therefore I write diary. How often I have said this! An odd psychological fact—that I can write when I’m too jangled to read. Moreover, I want to leave as few pages blank as possible; & the end of the year is only some three weeks off.

I meant to write about the change which I discovered last May (about) from seclusion & obscurity to some degree of prosperity & society. My prediction was that we [were] on the verge of something of the kind. And I see now I shall get my Saxon & my house. Oh there’s Adrian’s catastrophe to record—now 2 weeks old. Nessa rang me up in the middle of dinner with Tom here. “Adrian & Karin are going to separate.” You could have knocked me down with a feather, & Clive too, so he says. The devoted & inseparable couple! And it seemed (then—this is no longer so) tragic to me; & I was overcome, at hearing they’d been unhappy for years; & then went & told Tom & Leonard; & then 2 days later, met Adrian in the bathroom at 46; kissed his hand, & he burst into tears. Its an agony! he cried. So we went upstairs holding hands, (I to get ready for my speech at the School of Economics) & he walked to the bus, & told me how it had never been right—almost, but never quite right. They hadn’t quarrelled. I am too shaky to write. But then he stayed here & I felt come over me the old despair; the crouching servile feeling which is my lowest & worst; the desire for praise, which he never gets; & the old futile comparisons between his respect for Nessa & his disrespect for me came over me, that made me so wretched at Fitzroy Sqre. To my amusement, I found that Nessa, who had been cordial & sanguine about him had changed her view, owing to his visiting her, & now only foretells with despair several long silent sittings. She says, & Clive says, that Karin did it; Karin felt it more than he did. She felt all I used to feel: the snub; the check; the rebuke; the fastidiousness; the lethargy. Poor old Adrian!—he now subsides into a flat in Mecklenburgh Sqre; & drifts phantomlike forever. Undoubtedly Haynes was right: the D.N.B. crushed his life out before he was born. It gave me a twist of the head too. I shouldn’t have been so clever, but I should have been more stable, without that contribution to the history of England. Now for a hot bath."
1923.12.19,"I dont know if this is my last chance of writing, or if I shall take the black book to Rodmell & fill its last pages there. I am so stifled with work of all sorts, society of all sorts, & plans of all sorts, that I can’t pour a pure stream from my tap. In an hour Sprott & Mary are coming. Merely to count my company since I wrote would take my time & waste it. How elliptical this book becomes! I dont respect events any more: I’d like to record poor Tom’s getting drunk, all the same. We went to a flat in an arcade, & asked for Captain Eliot. I noticed that his eyes were blurred. He cut the cake meticulously. He helped us to coffee—or was it tea? Then to liqueurs. He repeated, L. noticed, “Mrs Ricardo”, as L. told his story; he got things a little wrong. There was a long pale squint eyed Oxford youth on the floor. We discussed the personal element in literature. Tom then quietly left the room. L. heard sounds of sickness. After a long time, he came back, sank into the corner, & I saw him, ghastly pale, with his eyes shut, apparently in a stupor. When we left he was only just able to stand on his legs. We heard a shuffling as we went, & Clive went back. Next day, I spent 10 minutes at the telephone receiving apologies—how distressing, what could we all think? Could we forgive him—the first time—would we ever come again? no dinner, no lunch—then sudden collapse—how dreadful—what a miserable end to the evening—apologise please to Leonard, to your sister—& so on. One of those comedies which life sometimes does to perfection.

I must briefly touch on Dadie; house problem not settled; Maynard threatening to cut down reviews; Leonard at this moment threatening to resign; Mary & Sprott; Clive & Braithwait, publishing, writing; doing Hardy, & Montaigne & the Greeks & the Elizabethans & the Hours; accepted in America, neglected by all prize givers, very happy, very much on the go—thats my state, at the moment of writing 6.14 p.m. on Wednesday aforesaid."
1924.01.03,"This year is almost certainly bound to be the most eventful in the whole of our (recorded) career. Tomorrow I go up to London to look for houses; on Saturday I deliver sentence of death upon Nellie & Lottie; at Easter we leave Hogarth; in June Dadie comes to live with us; & our domestic establishment is entirely controlled by one woman, a vacuum cleaner, & electric stoves. Now how much of this is dream, & how much reality? I should like, very much, to turn to the last page of this virgin volume & there find my dreams true. It rests with me to substantiate them between now & then. I need not burden my entirely frivolous page with whys & wherefores, how we reached these decisions, so quick. It was partly a question of coal at Rodmell. Then Nelly presented her ultimatum—poor creature, she’ll withdraw it, I know,—about the kitchen. “And I must have a new stove; & it must be on the floor so that we can warm our feet; & I must have a window in that wall….” Must? Is must a word to be used to Princes? Such was our silent reflection as we received these commands, with Lottie skirmishing around with her own very unwise provisoes & excursions. “You won’t get two girls to sleep in one room as we do” &c. “Mrs Bell says you can’t get a drop of hot water in this house….” “So you wont come here again, Nelly?” I asked. “No, ma’am, I wont come here again” in saying which she spoke, I think, the truth. Meanwhile, they are happy as turtles, in front of a roaring fire in their own clean kitchen, having attended the sales, & enjoyed all the cheap diversions of Richmond, which begin to pall on me. Already I feel ten years younger. Life settles round one, living here for 9 years as we’ve done; merely to think of a change lets in the air. Youth is a matter of forging ahead. I see my contemporaries satisfied, outwardly; inwardly conscious of emptiness. Whats it for? they ask themselves now & then, when the new year comes, & can’t possibly upset their comfort for a moment. I think of the innumerable tribe of Booth, for example; all lodged, nested, querulous, & believing firmly that they’ve been enjoined so to live by our father which is in heaven. Now my state is infinitely better. Here am I launching forth into vacancy. We’ve two young people depending on us. We’ve no house in prospect. All is possibility & doubt. How far can we make publishing pay? And can we give up the Nation? & could we find a house better than Monks House? Yes, thats cropped up, partly owing to the heaven sent address of Nelly. I turned into Thornton’s waiting for my train, & was told of an old house at Wilmington—I’m pleased to find [how] volatile our temperaments still are—& L. is steady as well, a triumph I can’t say I achieve—at the ages of 42 & 43—for 42 comes tripping towards me, the momentous year.

Now it is six, my boundary, & I must read Montaigne, & cut short those other reflections about, I think, reading & writing which were to fill up the page. I ought to describe the walk from Charleston too; but can’t defraud Montaigne any longer. He gets better & better, & so I cant scamp him, & rush into writing, & earn my 20 guineas as I hope. Did I record a tribute from Gosse: that I’m a nonentity, a scratch from Hudson, that the V.O. is rotten; & a compliment all the way from America from Rebecca West? Oh dear, oh dear, no boasting, aloud, in 1924. I didn’t boast at Charleston.
g"
1924.01.09,"At this very moment, or fifteen minutes ago, to be precise, I bought the ten years lease of 52 Tavistock Sqre London W.C.1—I like writing Tavistock. Subject of course to the lease, & to Providence, & to the unforeseen vagaries on the part of old Mrs Simons, the house is ours: & the basement, & the billiard room, with the rock garden on top, & the view of the square in front & the desolated buildings behind, & Southampton Row, & the whole of London—London thou art a jewel of jewels, & jasper of jocunditie—music, talk, friendship, city views, books, publishing, something central & inexplicable, all this is now within my reach, as it hasn’t been since August 1913, when we left Cliffords Inn, for a series of catastrophes which very nearly ended my life, & would, I’m vain enough to think, have ruined Leonard’s. So I ought to be grateful to Richmond & Hogarth, & indeed, whether its my invincible optimism or not, I am grateful. Nothing could have suited better all through those years when I was creeping about, like a rat struck on the head, & the aeroplanes were over London at night, & the streets dark, & no penny buns in the window. Moreover, nowhere else could we have started the Hogarth Press, whose very awkward beginning had rise in this very room, on this very green carpet. Here that strange offspring grew & throve; it ousted us from the dining room, which is now a dusty coffin; & crept all over the house.

And people have been here, thousands of them it seems to me. I’ve sat over this fire many an evening talking, & save for one fit of the glooms last summer, have never complained of Richmond, till I shed it, like a loose skin.

[Postscript by VW:] I’ve had some very curious visions in this room too, lying in bed, mad, & seeing the sunlight quivering like gold water, on the wall. I’ve heard the voices of the dead here. And felt, through it all, exquisitely happy.

Saxon is dining here tonight, & will be invited to move in with his troupe of lunatics at Easter. Our move can take place any time between Feb. 1st & then. Really, since I dont want to give auctioneers particulars, I may as well say briefly that my good genius for houses whispered in my ear on Monday, when, as I was leaving Mr Coade, the flushed young lady said “Mrs Woolf, are you still looking for a house?” “Thats what I’m here for” I said. “But I’d begun to think I’d better take a flat.” “Oh well, 52 Tavistock Sqre might suit you. It has a large studio.” The perverse young man made me come to Gordon Sqre next, then misdirected me; & then I ran into Adrian; & then both together we went into Messrs Dollman & Pritchard’s, through great green baize swing doors, up stairs, into a flat, now semi-dark; & then, down into the basement where I very rapidly lost count of rooms, & out into the old gentleman’s billiard room; & so decided this is our place if ever there was one.

Well, we had a long cold busy day yesterday—going, I did, twice to London, & ending with The Flame, a play which invented emotions which nobody has felt these 100 years; nobody felt even in 1824. But by a process of hypnotism, half Bayswater last night made themselves believe that other people felt like this & therefore that they ought to.

I may say that coincident with the purchase of 52 Tavistock Sqre (how I like writing that!) is the purchase of a nine penny pen, a fountain pen, which has an ordinary nib, & writes—sometimes very well. Am I more excited by buying Tavistock Sqre, or by buying my new fountain pen?—which reflection reminds me that I have volume 7 of Montaigne to polish off, & Saxon dining here. So in spite of a clouded brain, upstairs, fetch the books, & begin. First, though, one gaze into the fire—& oh dear, I’ve forgotten my ultimatum to the poor domestics. Both to go; & both very game, & also affectionate—a trying combination."
1924.01.12,"I have just introduced a great improvement in the cover of this book—a calendar. But to revert to those other improvements—shall I survive the process? There’s a snag in the lease: some drastic clause saying that Bedford can refuse permission to sublet. If exercised, this would throw the offices, now let at £250, on our hands. But they offer us the flat & basement separate. All this involves calculation; & what is worse, a good deal of depression on L.’s side. Then I ask myself, why do I do it? Is it worth it? Aren’t the risks too great? And I reply according to the mood I’m in. My heart turned like a wounded eel in my breast on Thursday night: it was serene as a summers day yesterday; now its sore and choppy. But I like myself for taking my fences. So long as rashness don’t become silliness. Suppose it all fails, anyhow I shall have tried to bring it off. Then Nelly has agreed to stay on alone as a general; & I am to find Lottie a place in Gordon Square. I see difficulty upon difficulty ahead. None of this would much matter if L. were happy; but with him despondent or grim, the wind is taken out of my sails, & I say what’s it all for?

But the truth is—no, I dont think I know the truth. Undoubtedly my chief prop is my writing, which cant fail me here or in London. But according to Montaigne, one is various. I cant lay down a law for my own feelings.

Its odd how entirely this house question absorbs one. It is a radical change, though. It means a revision of 4 lives. As for Lottie, I have my doubts, for her temper will always be unseating her, & I feel, after 7 years, or is it 8?, some responsibility for her. If by my doing she got into difficulty, I suppose I should blame myself. Yet for people of our age, which is in full summer, to dread risk & responsibility seems pusillanimous. We have no children to consider. My health is as good as it will be in this world, & a great deal better than it ever has been. The next ten years must see the press into fame or bankruptcy; to loiter on here is a handicap. But I’ve gone through all these matters time & time again, & wish I could think of something else. I’ve so much work on hand. Its odd how unimportant my work seems, suddenly, when a practical matter like this blocks the way. I see it as it appears to the world, from outside, not all cavernous & lit up as it appears from within.

Who have I seen? Saxon chiefly, & the Grants. They have a good deal of solid comfort at Grosvenor House Twickenham: chairs & tables & little mats on the dressing tables. There was a tight mute woman by the fire & Jim Rendel, playing chess with the old fluffy haired Major—that failure, that vivacious irresponsible old man, who lies on his sofa, a perfect gentleman, a man of the world, humorous, shrewd, practical, but ineffective utterly. In comes Ethel, & I perceive how lovely she was, & something charming still in their relationship, which is all worn away & staled; & she knows him, I suppose to be dying, & has her mind so set on practical affairs (they’re very poor) that she can’t feel anything. She is a stately kind, unimaginative woman, who pities me a little, I think. (Now dont think of the house problem!)

Seeing Saxon dont amount to much, though I see him now a distinguished man. If I met him in a room full, I should say who’s that? I think. Its partly that he’s become more sure of himself. And then, I fancy, reading Plato all through tells. I like his absence of detail—in discussing plans, for instance; though when it comes to practice, he’s a meticulous man, can’t order a taxi for himself without endless deliberations.

I saw Adrian & Karin too. There’s an unhappy woman if you like. But what is happiness? I define it to be a glow in the eye. Her eyes are like polished pavements—wet pavements. There’s no firelit cavern within. Molly’s eyes are a different matter. For I went to tea with her, in a very clean house in Oakley Street. There was Michael, a young man, blushing, nervous, in trousers. He had been out to tea, but didn’t like the people; they discuss such details, he said. “Which part of Devonshire do you like best?” Its amusing to see how that sort of question appears in reality, before one’s used to it. Molly is very pale, very shapeless, like a walrus, rather; has cut a fringe, which is pure grey; & manages to dress much better than I do. I love the distracted busy ways of these mothers—no parsimony of life, as there is with the childless—always something that must be decided, or done. Old Mrs MacCarthy is, I think, the most arrant & pernicious bore in the world; like a child, but not to be put down; insisting on her story being heard; utterly unable to see beyond her own plate of bread & butter; must know what kind of jam it is. Really I fancy these old ladies, without occupation, the most trying in the world. Two days ago she became a Roman Catholic. Charlie Sanger came in; patted Molly’s hand. He too respects maternal warmth. He has a great respect for the worth of human nature, it always strikes me; respects the upstanding qualities; knows how hard life is—not, perhaps, how pleasant. One of these days I mean to write a story about life turning all the faces in a tube carriage grey, sodden, brave, disillusioned. But why doesn’t it make any one of them look contented, happy, as if they’d got what they wanted? It gives a vivacity to the young, content to the elderly, very little intense pleasure, I shd. say, looking at them."
1924.01.20,"——the clock striking six, & Lord Berners, Siegfried Sassoon & William the chauffeur just gone. Yes, we have got into the peerage. Do I altogether like the peerage? The trouble is that there’s something a little opaque; they tell good stories; & I’ve rather lost the art of listening to their points. This Lord is as Siegfried says, a Kilburn Jew; round, fat, pale—no fairly chubby, a determined little man, whose rank, I fancy, gives him some consistency not otherwise his. Still, rank, nowadays, at my age, is slightly vulgar, like a fringe to the mantelpiece. Vita dined here with him; & with her too rank is a velvet fringe; theres something dense instead of vibrant. Old S.S. is a nice dear kind sensitive warmhearted good fellow. He came back, with William waiting, half shut the door, & asked me to get reviewing for [W. J.] Turner—“he hasn’t asked this himself mind you”. (I dont like being in any way deflected from my comfortable ways, when it comes to writing. That’s the worst of exciting society: it somehow makes one, momentarily, meretricious, in that department.) But to return. Siegfried is all right. Then what else has happened? No final news of Tavistock Square yet, but Saxon’s cook has apparently taken Hogarth; & says the garden will be very nice for her little girl, & if Mrs Turner may bring the gas stove which was the Drs present, they’ll come in March. (The thing about aristocrats is that they veil all pretence very humbly; & let one ride on their backs; & then suddenly turn seignurial). Here we are, though, going through a time of waiting. I shall be happy so soon as my claws are into the move. At present, I feel Oh God another journey? Must I go up by train? Where am I to change before dinner tomorrow, & so on. Lottie vacillates. First she says she’s going to get £60 & be maid housekeeper to Kid Lewis; then she’ll stay with Saxon—God knows what’ll be the end; & I shall be sorry to miss her—Now, I must tackle my Montaigne quotations, since thats demanded by some Cockney in charge of the Supt."
1924.01.23,"And on Monday if I’d written here I should have had to say “We have lost Tavistock Square”—lost it through the sharp practice of Mr Simon, & the easy going indolence of Mr Guy Hemsley. It was a very unpleasant shock, & for my part I don’t think we could easily have got over it—found as good a house that is, let alone the infinite dreariness of the hunt. Anyhow, after sitting fidgetting at the play (Munro’s Progress) & damning it considerably I went off to Coade, found myself expected, heard a very queer story—how Simon would let the Woolves have it if Coade would take £30 instead of £40: which Coade wouldnt; so I offered the extra £10; communicated with my solicitors by phone, across the office table (oh yes I’m grown up now) & had the matter arranged in 15 minutes, & went on to tea with Nessa swelling with pride & excitement—all great nonsense, L. would say. But my house finding genius was outraged; whats the good of me, it asked, if you let these sharpers trick you? And I warn you, 52 is your house. So, practically not only spiritually speaking it now is; for in spite of Hemsley & the strike & the failure of the draft contract to arrive, &c &c; I visited the office with cheque & signature before one today; & then spent a shilling on a plate of beef. Ah well! Now I can sigh contented over my fire, in spite of the rain, & the strike, & Lady Colefax & Ethel Sands, & all cares & sorrows & perplexities. They aren’t very grievous at the moment. The New Republic has taken my article on Jane Austen; £22 from the Dial for Lives of Obscure; &c &c. This time last year we were in a very different pair of shoes. Not that even then I was more than surface ruffled. No: I remember some very black, stagnant days about this time of year.

I have seen Roger; seen his pictures, which with the irrepressible vanity of the artist, he makes even the blind like me report on, by electric light, in a hurry. But enough of that; in every other way he abounds: cut him, wherever you like, & the juice wells up. Pamela is about to bear; so was his cat. Lytton has bought his house. Nessa is convicted by the law of not owning her flat at 50. I’ve said nothing of this great affair—the battle of Bells & Stephens. Clive will be turned out & the Americans will triumph. And this reminds me that I’m resolved to draw in my horns with Mary H. I was absurdly exacerbated by a laughing report of Roger’s that Clive is circulating an account of me, wishing to dress like Lady Diana &c. Mary will cheerfully roast me to make Clive smile; & I think she relishes a little vinegar in my wounds. But I’m not proud of my own behaviour either—except that I like being natural, & talking nonsense if I’ve a mind. This one cant do safely with her, & the excitability of my temper is such that when a light flick of the whip, like Roger’s is given me, I lose more—much more—than all the pleasure I get from talking like a genius over my fire to poor dear Mary—whom I like too. But it can’t be helped. And in London I shall have too many Mary’s, & can’t face the fritter to my nerves of the old intriguing ways.

Now I’m sending off Montaigne, & back again tomorrow to The Hours, which I was looking at disconsolately—oh the cold raw edges of one’s relinquished pages—when the House business started this morning. But now I am going to write till we move—6 weeks straight ahead. I think its the design that’s good this time—God knows.

A letter from Morgan today saying “To whom first but you & Virginia should I tell the fact that I’ve put the last words to my novel?” He is moved, as I am always on these occasions."
1924.02.03,"I didn’t write however, because L. started the flu, the very next day, & gave me an unpleasant day; but there’s an odd pleasure too, purely feminine I suppose, in ‘looking after’ being wanted; giving up my pen, & sitting with an invalid. But he was up in 4 days or less; & here we are, on the rails again, a very lovely spring day, which, by Heaven’s grace, we have spent alone. No servants at the moment; no callers. The sun laid gold leaf over the trees & chimneys today. The willows on the bank were—what word is it?—soft yellow plumy, like a cloud; like an infinitely fine spray; something showery in it; & also grains of gold. I can’t find the exact word; but reflect that I shant be walking here again next spring. I am not sentimental about it: Tavistock Square with the pale tower is more beautiful I think, let alone the adorable omnibuses.

Owing to the influenza, I don’t think I have seen more than a handful; went to Ethel [Sands]’s, was congratulated on Montaigne by Logan; Roger had stuck in it, though; talked to Arnold Bennett, a lovable sea lion, with chocolate eyes, drooping lids, & a protruding tusk. He has an odd accent; a queer manner; is provincial; very much a character; “I dont understand women—” This said as a schoolboy might say it. Everyone laughs. Then “No woman is as sensitive as I am—no woman could be….” I suspect he minds things, even my pinpricks. He is slow, kind, affectionate, hauls himself along a sofa. But there was Logan, launching questions at my head; balls one had to return. Roger came in, rather wild eyed & staring. Prince Bibesco, & a Princess, who, said Roger, made the rest of us appear provincial. What a cosmopolitan he is—how he dreads the British Parish; how he adores Paris. “She had lived in Paris” he said of this Princess: “So of course she cd. talk at once about interesting things.” But I did not stay to hear them.

Yesterday, the parochial Turners came to measure the alcoves, & ask me whether Mrs Turner’s father’s bureau could stand in the study—You must remember the piano, & the pianola case, said Edith, one of those worrying vague ‘bodies’, who compose the middle classes; wearisome women, machine made, but all bristling with their views; they get hot & cold, peevish & fluttered, like other people; more so indeed; but I can’t see why nature provides them, unless to supply Dartmouth with cadets, & colonels with wives. Nelly went to the flat with me, & next day wrote out a time table, to show that by 3 p.m. she would still have to wash up luncheon & do Leonard’s boots. Very well, I said, find a place with Lottie. But the end of a weeks consideration is, apparently, that Lottie goes with the Turners, & Nelly clings to us. The money is paid over, & the house presumably ours tomorrow. So I shall have a room of my own to sit down in, after almost 10 years, in London. I must now write to Logan, to ask for a book for the press, & then read Elizabethan for my next chapter. At any rate the reading for this blessed book is a great source of delight to me."
1924.02.09,"We have been measuring the flat. Now the question arises Is it noisy? No need to go into my broodings over that point. Fitzroy Sqre rubbed a nerve bare which will never sleep again while an omnibus is in the neighbourhood. My feeling about this move is that we’re doing the courageous thing; facing the facts, which for ten years, it will be good to do. Yes, this little achievement has been good I think.

Morgan was here last night; A Passage to India done; & he is much excited, on the boil with it, consulting L. about terms; has been offered £750. So he’s all right. And Heinemann this morning wants to publish my essays. Hendersons to dine, & Janet [Vaughan], I boasted of L. (he says). One cant joke with people one doesn’t know. They don’t even take dinner in the basement naturally. Desmond pitched down Mary’s stairs two nights ago, & broke his knee cap. Clive couldn’t stay with him. He was in great pain, but Ethel Sands said, very brave. Now he’s very irritable. So our feelings for our friends change. Cut me anywhere, & I bleed too profusely. Life has bred too much ‘feeling’ of a kind in me. Then (I’m so tired with parcels &c I cant concentrate) Marjorie has put earrings in her ears & left Joad. Poor chit! at 24. I was at Fitzroy then, & devilish unhappy too. She found a letter, left the house,—lives in a basement. Its melodrama, but forced on her by Cyril I expect. I’m working at The Hours, & think it a very interesting attempt; I may have found my mine this time I think. I may get all my gold out. The great thing is never to feel bored with one’s own writing. That is the signal for a change—never mind what, so long as it brings interest. And my vein of gold lies so deep, in such bent channels. To get it I must forge ahead, stoop & grope. But it is gold of a kind I think. Morgan said I had got further into the soul in Jacob’s Room than any other novelist. He was taking piano lessons from Hilda Saxe—spun his fingers very nimbly on the score. (And it’s just as noisy here, if one listens, as it can possibly be in T⁠[avistock]. S⁠[quare]. One gets into a habit of not listening. Remember this sage advice). Tom, the incredible Tom, writes “I do not take any prevision of antagonism” saluting some new review. Meredith white & laurel crowned could not be more magisterial.

Karin has been confiding. Adrian wants to come back. She wants life. I dont altogether like her, kicking up her heels, yet see her point, & respect her conscience, for she has A. on her mind. He sits alone in Mecklenburgh Sqre. ‘Its the quality you Stephens have she said. Its the real thing’ like an American with a Sheraton table. Faith Henderson says she flirted with Ralph, wants moonlight, big men, diamonds, kisses; but is too old; & not good enough. Hubert takes his views from her. Janet has the Vaughan rattle in her throat; a lady; large, gawky, will marry & breed."
1924.02.23,"Really I’ve a thousand things to do. I’ve just said to L. I’m so busy I can’t begin, which unfortunately is too true of me. My mind sits in front of a fence & pours out clouds of ideas; I have to stick spurs in sharp to make it jump. I should be reading Miss Mayor’s first chapters; Miss Bosanquet on Henry James & the Birds. Then I bethink me that with life in its present rush, I may never again write a word of this book at Hogarth House. & so should take a few minutes to lay the sod, or whatever the expression is. Its very cold, barbarous weather. Twice we have meant to go to Rodmell & failed. L. says Wells says there comes a stage when one can’t face an uncomfortable week end. Warmth is the one need I have. May’s Man, a great giant in gaiters who shook L. by the hand because we are real people & own a press, came today, & will move us on March 13th for £15. Nessa gets busy at 52 Tavy on Monday. I am going to force L. into the outrageous extravagance of spending £25 on painted panels, by Bell & Grant. We are trying to hook together all the resources of civilisation—telephone, gas, electric light, &, at this distance, naturally find it arduous. The electric light man doesn’t turn up. Lottie is going to Karin—I fancy I have forgotten that item. Really, if providence had tried, or I had set my wits to work at their most optimistic, I don’t think I could have arranged things better. First number 52 & its studio (wh. we think to make £75 on) then Saxon coming here; then Lottie next door, & so keeping Nelly in society. All could not have fallen out better, so far, I say, being by no means ready to bait the deity, who can always show his claws. That reminds me of the celebrated Mr [Bertrand] Russell the other night at Karin’s. (She gives her weekly party in the great gay drawingroom which is nevertheless a little echoing & lofty & very very chill). He said “Just as I saw a chance of happiness, the doctors said I had got cancer. My first thought was that that was one up to God. He had brought it off—just as I thought I saw a chance of happiness. When I was just getting better—I had very nearly died—my temperature was 107 twice over—the thing I liked was the sun: I thought how nice to feel the sun & the rain still. People came a long way after that. I wanted people very much, but not so much as the sun. The old poets were right. They made people think of death as going where they could not see the sun. I have become an optimist. I realise now that I like life—I want to live. Before that illness, I thought life was bad. Its an odd thing—both my pessimism & my optimism are instinctive” (I forget which he said was the deeper of the two.) So to Charlie Sanger, who is good all through; & then on to Moore. “When he first came up to Cambridge, he was the most wonderful creature in the whole world. His smile was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. We believed in Berkeley” (perhaps). “Suddenly, something went wrong with him; something happened to him and his work. Principia Ethica was nothing like so good as his Essay on Judgment (?). He was very fond of Ainsworth. I don’t know what happened—It ruined him. He took to putting out his tongue after that. You (I, that is) said he had no complexes. But he’s full of them. Watch him putting his tongue round his mouth. I said to him once, Moore, have you ever told a lie? “YES” he said—which was the only lie he ever told. He always speaks the truth at the Aristotelian. An old gentleman met me on my way here, & asked if I were going. No; I said (not such a fool). Joad is speaking tonight. Haldane made a speech once, & old Shad Hodgson had to pass a vote of thanks. He had had an epileptic fit that afternoon. He got up & talked nonsense—utter nonsense. So they asked me. And I had to thank Haldane, though I’d got ready to criticise every argument he used. Never mind: I put them all into an article, & that stung much sharper.” I asked him, as I ask everyone, to write his life for the press. But my mind is absolutely relevant. I cant ramble. I stick to facts. “Facts are what we want. Now the colour of your mother’s hair’?’ “She died when I was two—there you are—relevant facts. I remember my grandfather’s death, & crying, & then thinking it was over. I saw my brother drive up in the afternoon. Hooray! I cried. They told me I must not say hooray at all that day. I remember the servants all looking very attentively at me when I was brought to Pembroke Lodge after my father died. Whitehead’s father, who was the local parson, was sent for to persuade me that the earth was round. I said it was flat. And I remember—some seaside place, now destroyed—remembered the sands, I think. He had no one to play with. One does not like him. Yet he is brilliant of course; perfectly outspoken; familiar; talks of his bowels; likes people; & yet & yet—He disapproves of me perhaps? He has not much body of character. This luminous vigorous mind seems attached to a flimsy little car, like that on a large glinting balloon. His adventures with his wives diminish his importance. And he has no chin, & he is dapper. Nevertheless, I should like the run of his headpiece. We parted at the corner of the Square; no attempt to meet again."
1924.03.04,"Really I’m writing too much here. The twelve months at this rate will overflow. This is another, provisional farewell, for I may have no time—(& Thank God here’s L. Grizzle knows the way he shuts the door & jumps down & runs out:)"
1924.03.12,"And I’m now going to write the very last pages ever to be written at Hogarth House. First; the state of the weather. Its as if a fine veil had descended & lay, clear, over the chimneys; which are a pale yellow, & brick red. The veil clouds to the horizon, & I do not see the pagoda or the trees of Kew. My head is stuffy & heavy. Last night we dined at Blunden’s farewell party, 35 covers laid, 6 or 7 speeches made, I between honest claret coloured soapy Wright, & the nice, but melodramatic looking Lynd. My little drama however was provided by Murry—Lynd’s neighbour—who shook hands, about the fish course, warmly. Then, as people were going, came & sat beside me. This he volunteered: I asked him to come & lay his case before me at Tavistock. “We’re enemies” “Not enemies. We’re in different camps. But I’ve never said a word against you, Virginia.” “Nor I against you. But what is wrong with us?” “You begin out there—” spreading his hands. “We make patterns of pretty words?” “No. But you won’t begin with your instincts. You won’t own them. With all your exquisite sensibilities—you’re content to stay at that.” Here we came into a swift confused wrangle about “writing well”. I said one must throw every ounce of oneself into expression; & that the instinctive writers scamped their work. “I don’t scamp my work” said Murry. “You say that only men who write well can say what they mean. My God Virginia—” but here L. came up, & Murry who was beginning on Jacob’s Room switched off to L.’s article on Moore. Thats typical: you dont go down to the root of things. Moore ought to have [been] smacked on the bottom for talking about Hardy as he did. That disgraceful sentence about Hardy wanting a place by Aeschylus—as if Hardy thought of any place except one by Rhoda Broughton—L. defended: said we must go. But I shant meet Murry for 10 years, & I want to finish the argument—Shall I come to the Adelphi? “Do.” “Not unless you’ll come to see me—I shall stand on my rights—” If you put it like that I will, he said, ferociously (yet so oleaginously, with a rolling lustful, or somehow leering, eye, so that I kept thinking how he’d come down in the world, spiritually, what tenthrate shillyshallying humbugs he must live among.) And we said goodbye for ten years. He liked me, he said; he had always liked me, & enjoyed meeting me like this. Off we went. How honest [?] & trusty & sterling Francis Birrell was in comparison!

So home that long cold exhausting journey for the last time. Some odds & ends of ideas came to me at the dinner. For one thing, how pungent people’s writing is compared with people’s flesh. We were all toothless insignificant amiable nonentities—we distinguished writers—Not a fig would I give for anyone’s praise or curse. Jack Squire, fat, & consequential; Eddie [Marsh] grown grey & fatherly; Nevinson beetroot coloured, & a little praising blood, & by inference himself; Tomlinson like the hard knob of a walking stick carved by a boy of 8; Blunden, despairing, drooping, crow-like, rather than Keats’ like. And did we really all believe in Blunden’s ‘genius’ Had we read his poems? How much sincerity was there in the whole thing? The truth is these collective gatherings must be floated by some conventional song, in which all can join, like He’s a jolly good fellow, which Squire started. Subtler impressions did occur to me, but I cant place them at the moment. Nor at the moment can I think of any farewell for this beautiful & lovable house, which has done us such a good turn for almost precisely nine years, so that, as I lay in bed last night, I nearly humanised it, & offered it my thanks. Old Mrs Turner will lie in my room now, & die there, it is predicted in two years time, among her china, her linen, & her great flowering wall papers, her father’s bureau, & several enormous wardrobes.

52 Tavistock Sqre"
1924.04.05,"Well, I will make a brief beginning—after 3 weeks silence. But it has not been silence at all. The noise of bus & taxi has worried me, & the noise of the human tongue has disturbed me, pleasantly & otherwise, & now I’m half asleep. Leonard working as usual.

Tonight, & one other, are the only nights I’ve been in this week; & all this afternoon went in talking to Mr Littell of the New Republic. But can I collect any first impressions? how Marchmont Street was like Paris; how my first night in the basement I saw the moon, with drifting clouds, & it was a terrifying & new [?] London moon; dreadful & exciting; as if the Richmond moon had been veiled. Oh the convenience of this place! & the loveliness too. We walk home from theatres, through the entrails of London. Why do I love it so much? … for it is stony hearted, & callous. The tradespeople don’t know one—but these disparaging remarks about the shopkeepers of Marchmont Street were interrupted & it is now Tuesday, April 15th, & L. & I have been having one of those melancholy middle aged summings up of a situation which occur from time to time, but are seldom recorded. Indeed most of life escapes, now I come to think of it: the texture of the ordinary day. We were to have had a quiet week, & I brought in Mortimer after Gerhardt last night, & he stayed & talked, aimlessly enough, about his money & his uncles; & so L. was desperately gloomy. Not a stroke of work done he says, since we came to London. This is largely imagination anticipating what people say must happen I think, though its true fish keep drifting into the net. Gerald Brenan back; Roger rampant to paint us; Morgan, elflike, mocking, aloof; Nessa & Duncan. Then there was Angelica’s accident which, for the psychology of it I should have described. Here was Nessa painting, & I answering the telephone. Positively bad news has to batter down optimism before it reaches one’s ears. Louie & Angelica have been knocked down by a motor & are in the Middlesex hospital. Having got that into my head, I had to repeat it to Nessa: to destroy all that simmering everyday comfort, with the smell of paint in the room, & Tom just coming up stairs to tea. She ran out & away from the telephone instinctively, ran round in an aimless way for a second. Then off they dashed & I after them, & so to the hospital, holding hands in the cab; & then sheer agony, for there was Louie, with her foot bandaged, & no Angelica; only an evasive nurse, parrying enquiries & taking us behind a screen where Angelica lay in bed, still, her face turned away. At last she moved. “She’s not dead” Duncan said. They both thought her dead. Then the young Dr came, & seemed silently & considerately but firmly to wish the mother to know that the case was hopeless: very grave; run over across the stomach. Yes there may have to be an operation. The surgeon had been sent for, & was now on the train. So Nessa went back to sit there, & I saw again that extraordinary look of anguish, dumb, not complaining, which I saw in Greece, I think, when she was ill. The feelings of the people who don’t talk express themselves thus. My feeling was “a pane of glass shelters me. I’m only allowed to look on at this.” at which I was half envious, half grieved. Moreover, I was sent off to find Clive, & so spared, or not allowed, the long wait there, in the chattering ward. Its a queer thing to come so close to agony as this, & just to be saved oneself. What I felt was, not sorrow or pity for Angelica, but that now Nessa would be an old woman; & this would be an indelible mark; & that death & tragedy had once more put down his paw, after letting us run a few paces. People never get over their early impressions of death I think. I always feel pursued. But theres an end of this. Nothing was wrong with Angelica—it was only a joke this time.

It takes a long time to form a habit—the habit of living at 52 Tavistock Sqre is not quite formed, but doing well. Already I have spent a week without being bothered by noise. One ceases to hear or to see. The dominant interests, I suppose assert themselves, make order by triumphing over the lesser. I notice things much less than I did 10 days ago. Soon I shall be making a habit of life in this room.

As for work, I have done the Dr chapter in my novel: & am furbishing up the Greeks; the usual depressions assail me. My criticism seems to me pretty flimsy sometimes. But there is no principle, except to follow this whimsical brain implicitly, pare away the ill fitting, till I have the shape exact, & if thats no good, it is the fault of God, after all. It is He that has made us, not we ourselves. I like that text. I don’t at all regret Richmond. Ethel Sands &c think I ought to mourn my beautiful room. But I now behold what is more beautiful—the Russell Imperial Hotel in the evening sunshine; pink & yellow like the Brighton front. I regret Saturday afternoons a little—How I meander & drivel!

Marjorie [Joad] is on her holiday. I keep shop of a morning. Dadie has been—a sensitive vain youth, with considerable grit in him, I judge. Sometimes the future appears perilous; problematical rather, the press that is, but always fruitful & interesting. I have said nothing of my speech at the London Group, which drew tears; or of a host of matters. On Thursday we go to Rodmell, the test of poor Nelly’s endurance. And now for the Elizabethans.

Grosvenor Sqre houses are precisely like saloons in Victorian Inns, or glorified boarding houses: handsome ill-proportioned rooms; gilt chairs, fretted tables; urns & vases depicted in pale mauve on the watered silk walls. Each wall has a piece—smugglers, coaching & so on; a little fire burns in a large grate; a glass screen fends it off, & there Nelly & Lord Bob perch, very chilly & formal, a dragoon bringing in little cakes."
1924.05.05,"This is the 29th anniversary of mothers death. I think it happened early on a Sunday morning, & I looked out of the nursery window & saw old Dr Seton walking away with his hands behind his back, as if to say It is finished, & then the doves descending, to peck in the road, I suppose, with a fall & descent of infinite peace. I was 13, & could fill a whole page & more with my impressions of that day, many of them ill received by me, & hidden from the grown ups, but very memorable on that account: how I laughed, for instance, behind the hand which was meant to hide my tears; & through the fingers saw the nurses sobbing.

But enough of death—its life that matters. We came back from Rodmell 7 days ago, after a royal Easter which Nelly survived heroically. After weeding I had to go in out of the sun; & how the quiet lapped me round! & then how dull I got, to be quite just: & how the beauty brimmed over me & steeped my nerves till they quivered, as I have seen a water plant quiver when the water overflowed it. (This is not right, but I must one day express that sensation). Then my troubles with the noise here—did I have a headache, or what? I Monday May 26th quite forget, being now come back again from Rodmell for the 2nd time, & using up my fidgets in the old way. For it seems to me that this diary may die of London, if I’m not careful.

London is enchanting. I step out upon a tawny coloured magic carpet, it seems, & get carried into beauty without raising a finger. The nights are amazing, with all the white porticoes & broad silent avenues. And people pop in & out, lightly, divertingly like rabbits; & I look down Southampton Row, wet as a seal’s back or red & yellow with sunshine, & watch the omnibus going & coming, & hear the old crazy organs. One of these days I will write about London, & how it takes up the private life & carries it on, without any effort. Faces passing lift up my mind; prevent it from settling, as it does in the stillness at Rodmell.

But my mind is full of The Hours. I am now saying that I will write at it for 4 months, June, July, August & September, & then it will be done, & I shall put it away for three months, during which I shall finish my essays; & then that will be—October, November, December—January: & I shall revise it January February March April; & in April my essays will come out; & in May my novel. Such is my programme. It is reeling off my mind fast & free now; as ever since the crisis of August last, which I count the beginning of it, it has gone quick, being much interrupted though. It is becoming more analytical & human I think; less lyrical; but I feel as if I had loosed the bonds pretty completely & could pour everything in. If so—good. Reading it remains. I aim at 80,000 words this time. And I like London for writing it, partly because, as I say, life upholds one; & with my squirrel cage mind, its a great thing to be stopped circling. Then to see human beings freely & quickly is an infinite gain to me. And I can dart in & out & refresh my stagnancy.

I have left the whole of society unrecorded. Tidmarsh, Cambridge, & now Rodmell: We had a queer little party here the other day—when the sinister & pedagogic Tom cut a queer figure. I cannot wholly free myself from suspicions about him—at the worst they only amount to calling him an American schoolmaster: a very vain man. He took me to Lear (unrecorded) & we both jeered & despised; & now he comes out in the Criterion with solemn & stately rebuke of those who jeer & despise. I taxed him, lightly with this: he sat tight & said that he meant what he wrote: then what does he mean by what he says? God knows. There’s something hole & cornerish, biting in the back, suspicious, elaborate, uneasy, about him: much would be liberated by a douche of pure praise, which he can scarcely hope to get. There was Philip Ritchie with his very clear cut nose. And shant I have a bath? as we’ve Dr Glover coming to discuss the P.S.S. & then put on my new red dress? Leonard thinks less well of me for powdering my nose, & spending money on dress. Never mind. I adore Leonard."
1924.06.14,"Back from Whitsun at Rodmell, & just off to sit in Gordon Sqre with Nessa & Angelica; so my diary will be defrauded; stifled by too much life. The unrecorded clogs my pen. Roger’s story at the Etoile the other night was perhaps my most sensational piece of news. “Something dreadful has happened to me” he said, staring very steadily with his great wide open eyes. At which I, being frivolous, laughed. “But it was dreadful,” upon wh. to the credit of my heart, it stopped beating, expecting cancer. And then he told me the story of the mad French peasant woman who shot herself for love of him on the cliff at Havre looking towards England. “And so my last chance of happiness is gone” said Roger. And so we walked town Tottenham Court Rd in the pouring rain, I protesting affection, & Roger saying that he was fated; he was cursed; he had never had more than 3 weeks happiness in his life. “I have pleasure—I enjoy my friends—but no happiness.” I see what he means. And he’s so young, he says—& so fond of women. To which Nessa adds, pertinently, that he’ll recover, & do it again. For of course we cant help becoming cynical & merry. To hear us, gulls like Ott. (who’s been here contaminating the June night) would think we were heartless. But how long can Roger love a woman without driving her mad? This creature thought he laughed at her, seeing that he dyed vests yellow & sent them to her, telling her to turn to the East & put them on, as a cure for tuberculosis. And he sent her pictures of negro sculpture. For some reason, against my habit, I feel as if I should like to write a story of this."
1924.06.21,"I am oh so sleepy; in fact just woken from a hot drowse. This week is Apostles week, & we went to a disillusioned party last night, after which L. contemplated, seriously, some scientific form of suicide. I have my moods too. If I weren’t so sleepy, I would write about the soul. I think its time to cancel that vow against soul description. What was I going to say? Something about the violent moods of my soul. How describe them, even with a waking mind? I think I grow more & more poetic. Perhaps I restrained it, & now, like a plant in a pot, it begins to crack the earthenware. Often I feel the different aspects of life bursting my mind asunder. Morgan is too restrained in his new book perhaps. I mean, what’s the use of facts at our time of life? Why build these careful cocoons [?]: why not say straight out—yes, but what?

I met Sydney Waterlow last night, & was monolithic on purpose,—a bad thing to be; but I feared gushing & depths, & intended to keep myself free. He no doubt prescribes speaking out. Murry is married again; & I don’t often think of Katherine with any vividness.

I look forward with a little alarm to Dadie coming, chiefly I think that it commits us more seriously. But that will wear off soon. It seems to me the beginning of ten years of very hard work, because, for one thing, I should hate failure, & not to fail, we must keep on pressing forward, thinking, planning, imagining, letter writing, asking Vita to write, &c &c Siegfried [Sassoon] to write, accepting Nancy Cunard; I dont see how Marjorie will fit in, altogether, & rather anticipate some rearrangement. So far, no gossip & no soul. Yet I’ve seen—Bob, Desmond, Lytton, Sebastian, Dorothy Bussy, Mrs Eliot—this last making me almost vomit, so scented, so powdered, so egotistic, so morbid, so weakly; & I already stale & talk sore with the rest of our doings.

I am writing, writing, & see my way clear to the end now, & so shall gallop to it, somehow or other. But 1 am invaded by drowsiness; & cant write out what I had in my head to write before tea; can’t even remember what it was; but shall go down to the basement where L. is printing, & then round to Gordon Sqre & then home to dinner, & then finish Romeo & Juliet by the open window, in spite of the noise, with the lovely view, & so to sleep; & to wake & all the rest of it."
1924.07.03,"This is Dadie’s second day. I looked out of my window, dressing, yesterday & saw him in grey with black bowler, Leonard, & Grizzle marching to the pillar box. Marjorie is ill, which is all to the good: business is brisk; I sat in the basement two days ago & took £5. Undoubtedly business is increasing—all divine fun. But I have let Garsington languish like a decaying wreath on my pen. That was last Sunday. And, treading close on Garsington were the enamelled Lady Colefax, actually in this room, like a cheap bunch of artificial cherries, yet, loyal, hard, living on a burnished plate of facts: as for example Wembley: “a man who was in Canada tells me” “I happened to know the Editor of the Daily Express’ all the time slightly trembling, in fear; inquisitive; not at all able to sink to the depths; but a superb skimmer of the surface; which is bright, I suppose, & foam tipped. I can’t bring myself to despise this gull as I ought. But aristocrats, worldlings, for all their surface polish, are empty, slippery, coat the mind with sugar & butter, & make it slippery too. Solid Lord Berners, who might have [been] cleft from an oak knot, had to tell stories, could not endure silence, & much preferred laughter to thought: amiable characteristics, Clive says. To me, after a time, laborious & depressing. Good prim priggish bright eyed Peter [F. L. Lucas] is a cut above that. I met him at Clive’s, & he sliced English literature up very prettily, with a pocket knife. (Here Dadie came in & I had to make him tea; then we walked in the square in the rain; then called on the Stracheys, & I heard a good deal about Lord Lytton’s blue dressing gown from Lady Strachey.)"
1924.07.05,"Just back, not from the 1917 Club; but from Knole, where indeed I was invited to lunch alone with his Lordship. His lordship lives in the kernel of a vast nut. You perambulate miles of galleries; skip endless treasures—chairs that Shakespeare might have sat on—tapestries, pictures, floors made of the halves of oaks; & penetrate at length to a round shiny table with a cover laid for one. A dozen glasses form a circle each with a red rose in it. What can one human being do to decorate itself in such a setting? One feels that one ought to be an elephant able to consume flocks & be hung about with whole blossoming trees—whereas one solitary peer sits lunching by himself in the centre, with his napkin folded into the shape of a lotus flower. Obviously, I did not keep my human values & my aesthetic values distinct. Knole is a conglomeration of buildings half as big as Cambridge I daresay; if you stuck Trinity Clare & King’s together you might approximate. But the extremities & indeed the inward parts are gone dead. Ropes fence off half the rooms; the chairs & the pictures look preserved; life has left them. Not for a hundred years have the retainers sat down to dinner in the great hall. Then there is Mary Stuart’s altar, where she prayed before execution. “An ancestor of ours took her the death warrant” said Vita. All these ancestors & centuries, & silver & gold, have bred a perfect body. She is stag like, or race horse like, save for the face, which pouts, & has no very sharp brain. But as a body hers is perfection. So many rare & curious objects hit one’s brain like pellets which perhaps may unfold later. I cut no very intelligent sight seer beside Geoffrey Scott,—There was Lady Gerald Wellesley, & we motored down through Kent, which Vita loves; all very free & easy, supple jointed as the aristocrat is; no inhibitions, no false reserves; anything can be said; but as usual, that fatal simplicity or rigidity of mind which makes it seem all a little unshaded, & empty. More mind, my God— (I’m too jangled even to quote correctly). As a setting & preparation I always feel this, or Ottoline’s, or any aristocrat’s that I know, to be perfection. But one waits, & nothing happens. Not but what Harold [Nicolson], sitting on the iron bar before the great burning logs, gently butting the tassel from the baldaquin, or whatever its called, with his forehead, wasn’t trusty & honest & vigorous. He wore a blue velvet jacket. I liked him better than the suaver & suppler Geoffrey. I rather suspect Geoffrey suspected me; smelt me to be of his herd, & not the aristocrats, & caught himself winking at me, like a couple of ragamuffins, & did not like to be reminded of his ragamuffin days. He referred bitterly to Florence & Berensons & that awful society. But its the breeding of Vita’s that I took away with me as an impression, carrying her & Knole in my eye as I travelled up with the lower middle classes, through slums. There is Knole, capable of housing all the desperate poor of Judd Street, & with only that one solitary earl in the kernel.

Marjorie has pneumonia; & we are likely to be worked off our feet. MSS pour in; & this press becomes a serious business."
1924.08.02,"Here we are at Rodmell, & I with 20 minutes to fill in before dinner. A feeling of depression is on me, as if we were old & near the end of all things. It must be the change from London & incessant occupation. Then, being at a low ebb with my book—the death of Septimus,—I begin to count myself a failure. Now the point of the Press is that it entirely prevents brooding, & gives me something solid to fall back on. Anyhow, if I can’t write, I can make other people write: I can build up a business. The country is like a convent. The soul swims to the top. Julian has just been & gone, a tall young man, who, inveterately believing myself to be young as I do, seems to me like a younger brother: anyhow we sit & chatter, as easily as can be. Its all so much the same—his school continues Thoby’s school. He tells me about boys & masters as Thoby used to. It interests me just in the same way. He’s a sensitive, very quick witted, rather combative boy; full of Wells, & discoveries, & the future of the world. And, being of my own blood, easily understood—going to be very tall, & go to the Bar, I daresay. Nevertheless, in spite of the grumbling with which this began, honestly I don’t feel old; & its a question of getting up my steam again in writing. If only I could get into my vein & work it thoroughly deeply easily, instead of hacking out this miserable 200 words a day, And then, as the manuscript grows, I have the old fear of it. I shall read it & find it pale. I shall prove the truth of Murry’s saying, that there’s no way of going on after Jacob’s Room. Yet if this book proves anything, it proves that I can only write along those lines, & shall never desert them, but explore further & further, & shall, heaven be praised, never bore myself an instant. But this slight depression—what is it? I think I could cure it by crossing the channel, & writing nothing for a week. I want to see something going on busily without help from me: a French market town for example. Indeed, have I the energy, I’ll cross to Dieppe; or compromise by exploring Sussex on a motor bus. August ought to be hot. Deluges descend. We sheltered under a haystack today. But oh the delicacy & complexity of the soul—for, haven’t I begun to tap her & listen to her breathing after all? A change of house makes me oscillate for days. And thats life; thats wholesome. Never to quiver is the lot of Mr Allinson [Allison], Mrs Hawkesford, & Jack Squire. In two or three days, acclimatised, started, reading & writing, no more of this will exist. And if we didn’t live venturously, plucking the wild goat by the beard, & trembling over precipices, we should never be depressed, I’ve no doubt; but already should be faded, fatalistic & aged."
1924.08.03,"Now its already going, my silver mist, & I don’t quite recognise myself of yesterday. L. has been telling me about Germany, & reparations, how money is paid. Lord what a weak brain I have—like an unused muscle. He talks; & the facts come in, & I can’t deal with them. But by dint of very painful brain exercises, perhaps I understand a little more than Nelly of the International situation. And L. understands it all—picks up all these points out of the daily paper absolutely instantly, has them connected, ready to produce. Sometimes I think my brain & his are of different orders. Were it not for my flash of imagination, & this turn for books, I should be a very ordinary woman. No faculty of mine is really very strong.

But its a question of work. I am already a good deal pulled together by sticking at my books: my 250 words of fiction first, & then a systematic beginning, I daresay the 80th, upon the Common Reader, who might be finished in a flash I think, did I see the chance to flash & have done with it. But there’s a lot of work in these things. It strikes me, I must now read Pilgrim’s Progress: Mrs Hutchinson. Addison 1672-1719

Defoe 1659-1731

Pepys 1660

Evelyn 1660 And should I demolish Richardson? whom I’ve never read. Yes, I’ll run through the rain into the house & see if Clarissa is there. But thats a block out of my day, a long long novel. Then I must read the Medea. I must read a little translated Plato."
1924.08.15,"Into all these calculations, broke the death of Conrad, followed by a wire from the Lit. Sup. earnestly asking me kindly to do a leader on him, which flattered & loyal, but grudgingly, I did; & its out; & that number of the Lit. Sup. corrupted for me (for I cant, & never shall be able to, read my own writings. Moreover, now little Walkley’s on the war path again I expect a bite next Wednesday). Yet I have never never worked so hard. For, having to do a leader in 5 days, I made hay after tea—& couldn’t distinguish tea hay from morning hay either. So doesn’t this give me two extra hours for critical works anyhow (as Logan calls them)? So I’m trying it—my fiction before lunch, & then essays after tea. For I see that Mrs Dalloway is going to stretch beyond October. In my forecasts I always forgot some most important intervening scenes: I think I can go straight at the grand party & so end; forgetting Septimus, which is a very intense & ticklish business, & jumping Peter Walsh eating his dinner, which may be some obstacle too. But I like going from one lighted room to another, such is my brain to me; lighted rooms; & the walks in the fields are corridors; & now to day I’m lying & thinking. By the way, why is poetry wholly an elderly taste? When I was 20, in spite of Thoby who used to be so pressing & exacting, I could not for the life of me read Shakespeare for pleasure; now it lights me as I walk to think I have 2 acts of King John tonight, & shall next read Richard the 2nd. It is poetry that I want now—long poems. Indeed I’m thinking of reading [Thomson’s] The Seasons. I want the concentration & the romance, & the words all glued together, fused, glowing: have no time to waste any more on prose. Yet this must be the very opposite to what people say. When I was 20 I liked 18th Century prose; I liked Hakluyt, Merimée. I read masses of Carlyle, Scott’s life & letters, Gibbon, all sorts of two volume biographies, & Shelley. Now its poetry I want, so I repeat like a tipsy sailor in front of a public house.

We went to Charleston, & the Keynes’ (so they are now called) with Robertson in attendance came here. Lydia (I called her Rezia by mistake) leaves crumbs sticking to her face. And Maynard is grown very thick & opulent; but I like him for his innocency. At Charleston theres the fat boy in split blue cotton trousers—Quentin that is; almost a street sight, now that hes back, fatter than ever. Julian rather nervous & fine drawn in comparison; & old Roger lean, brown, & truculent, attacking first Shaw, then Conrad, & taking L.’s journalism as literally & bellicosely as usual. O these Quakers! I don’t think he’s very happy though, & that affair at Havre gnaws at him, in the midst of family life, I’ve no doubt.

I dont often trouble now to describe cornfields & groups of harvesting women in loose blues & reds & little staring yellow frocked girls. But thats not my eyes’ fault: coming back the other evening from Charleston, again all my nerves stood upright, flushed, electrified (whats the word?) with the sheer beauty—beauty abounding & superabounding, so that one almost resents it, not being capable of catching it all, & holding it all at the moment. This progress through life is made immensely interesting by trying to grasp all these developments as one passes. I feel as if I were putting out my fingers tentatively on (here is Leonard, who has ordered me a trap in which to drive Dadie to Tilton tomorrow) either side as I grope down a tunnel, rough with odds & ends. And I dont describe encounters with herds of Aldemeys anymore—though this would have been necessary some years ago—how they barked & belled like stags round Grizzle; & how I waved my stick & stood at bay; & thought of Homer as they came flourishing & trampling towards me: some mimic battle. Grizzle grew more & more insolent & excited & skirmished about yapping. Ajax? That Greek, for all my ignorance, has worked its way into me.

Mayor is printing her second edition, Stephen doing very well, Leys publishing. Nancy Cunard estimating, Mrs Devonshire … rejecting; business very brisk all round, I issuing a circular to all exhibitors at the Royal Academy of Duncan’s book. Marjorie meanwhile convalesces, presumably, & the question of her future with us comes up to be decided."
1924.09.07,"It is a disgrace that I write nothing, or if I write, write sloppily, using nothing but present participles. I find them very useful in my last lap of Mrs D. There I am now—at last at the party, which is to begin in the kitchen, & climb slowly upstairs. It is to be a most complicated spirited solid piece, knitting together everything & ending on three notes, at different stages of the staircase, each saying something to sum up Clarissa. Who shall say these things? Peter, Richard, & Sally Seton perhaps: but I don’t want to tie myself down to that yet. Now I do think this might be the best of my endings, & come off, perhaps. But I have still to read the first chapters, & confess to dreading the madness rather; & being clever. However, I’m sure I’ve now got to work with my pick at my seam, if only because my metaphors come free, as they do here. Suppose one can keep the quality of a sketch in a finished & composed work? That is my endeavour. Anyhow, none can help & none can hinder me any more. I’ve been in for a shower of compliments too from The Times, Richmond rather touching me by saying that he gives way to my novel with all the will in the world. I should like him to read my fiction, & always suppose he doesn’t.

We had Dadie twice to stay; Clive & Mary yesterday; I slept a night at Charleston; L. went to Yorkshire: rather an odd disjointed wet summer, with people dropping in, Nelly rather moping, but loyal, Asheham offered us one evening by Mr Gunn, as he was poking his corn cocks, & looking at their blackness. I was tempted after 24 hours to buy it. We might get it for £1,500. But then it is dark & damp; & the loveliness might not quite compensate. The garden here flourishes. We put off deciding. We could let it of course, which we could not this, so that to fear being tied is no doubt foolish. Norman Leys was here one night; making it quite plain that only certain sorts of people could pass the eye of his needle; & paring one down very quick; one of these good sturdy uncompromising men, whom M⁠[argaret]. Ll⁠[ewelyn], D⁠[avies]. would like, very able, trusty; paying no attention to art of any kind, & enforcing his virtue at every turn—but it is virtue of course. “They belong to the gentlemanly side of the family…” Distrusts Oxford. Wishes to write as clearly as he can, hopes to live in the East end & educate working men. Wife spends £150 on garden; this distressing, but her only pleasure. Doesn’t like taking fees, wh. mean that children go without boots. Thought me Thackeray’s daughter & was only reassured when I cleared away dinner, & talked of religion, morality, his quarrel with the Colonial office, how he was besieged; protests too much in short; but a very nice man."
1924.09.15,"Here I am waiting for L. to come back from London, & at this hour, having been wounded last year when he was late, I always feel the old wound twingeing. He has been seeing Nancy Cunard, so I expect a fair gossip. Vita was here for Sunday, gliding down the village in her large new blue Austin car, which she manages consummately. She was dressed in ringed yellow jersey, & large hat, & had a dressing case all full of silver & night gowns wrapped in tissue. Nelly said “If only she weren’t an honourable!” & couldn’t take her hot water. But I like her being honourable, & she is it; a perfect lady, with all the dash & courage of the aristocracy, & less of its childishness than I expected. She left with us a story which really interests me rather. I see my own face in it, its true. But she has shed the old verbiage, & come to terms with some sort of glimmer of art; so I think; & indeed, I rather marvel at her skill, & sensibility; for is she not mother, wife, great lady, hostess, as well as scribbling? How little I do of all that: my brain would never let me milk it to the tune of 20,000 words in a fortnight, & so I must lack some central vigour, I imagine. Here I am, peering across Vita at my blessed Mrs Dalloway; & can’t stop, of a night, thinking of the next scene, & how I’m to wind up. Vita, to attempt a return, is like an over ripe grape in features, moustached, pouting, will be a little heavy; meanwhile, she strides on fine legs, in a well cut skirt, & though embarrassing at breakfast, has a manly good sense & simplicity about her which both L. & I find satisfactory. Oh yes, I like her; could tack her on to my equipage for all time; & suppose if life allowed, this might be a friendship of a sort. The clock strikes 7, & I wonder if I hear Leonard, above the grey wild wind, talking to Nelly in the kitchen. Grizzle pricks a ear; lies flat again. He works & works. Here has the postman been, making me choke a little, born sentimentalist that I am, by hoping so honestly & sincerely that Mr Woolf would address the ILP at Lewes on the League of Nations? This sort of thing counts: Does Murry, the professor of the soul, talk to postmen about the League of Nations? I like their trust & admiration; & the swing from Knole & Lord Sackville’s invitation (J’s R his favourite novel) to postmen getting up the local meetings, which suddenly seem to me, matters of the highest importance. All this confirms me in thinking that we’re splinters & mosaics; not, as they used to hold, immaculate, monolithic, consistent wholes. How I scribble; & what use will this be for my great memoir writing age?

With Vita we discussed the murder of Mr Joshua, Ottoline, literature. Then she took us to Charleston—& how one’s world spins round—it looked all very grey & shabby & loosely cut in the light of her presence. As for Monks House, it became a ruined barn, & we picknicking in the rubbish heap. And then I regained my zest for life about an hour later. Now to the house, waiting for L."
1924.09.29,"A fortnight later: writing partly to test my new penkala (professing fountain qualities) partly to exorcise my demon. Only Karin & Ann: only a hole blown in my last chapter. There I was swimming in the highest ether known to me, & thinking I’d finish by Thursday; Lottie suggests to Karin we’d like to have Ann: Karin interprets my polite refusal to her own advantage & comes down herself on Saturday, blowing everything to smithereens. More & more am I solitary; the pain of these upheavals is incalculable; & I cant explain it either. She saw nothing. “Disturbing the flow of inspiration?” she said this morning, having shouted outside the door till I had to fetch cotton wool. And its down in ruins my house; my wings broken; & I left on the bare ground. Odd, very odd, how violent this has become. I dread even going back to London. True, I’m in the crisis, & if this last chapter spoils, the book spoils. But what cares Karin! Thats the rub. She slightly chortles to plant us with some of her burdens & makes off well pleased at having got her way. Didn’t I years ago record in one of these very volumes that she’d get what can be got by asking, nothing more? It is a case of spiritual deafness: she hears nothing of peoples thoughts; that is why she is, as she says unhappy; & its an affliction, not her fault; certainly our misfortune. Here I am with my wrecked week—for how serene & lovely like a Lapland night was our last week together—feeling that I ought to go in & be a good aunt—wh. I’m not by nature: ought to ask Daisy what she wants; & by rights I fill these moments full of Mrs Dalloway’s party for tomorrows writing. The only solution is to stay on alone over Thursday, & try my luck. A bad night (K.’s doing again) may partly account. But how entirely I live in my imagination; how completely depend upon spurts of thought, coming as I walk, as I sit; things churning up in my mind & so making a perpetual pageant, which is to me my happiness. This brew cant sort with nondescript people. These wails must now have ending, partly because I cannot see, & my hand shakes, having carried my bag from Lewes, where I sat on the castle top, where an old man was brushing leaves, & told me how to cure Lumbago; you tie a skein of silk round you; the silk costs 3 pence. I saw British canoes, & the oldest plough in Sussex 1750 found at Rodmell, & a suit of armour said to have been worn at Seringapatam. All this I should like to write about, I think.

And of course children are wonderful & charming creatures. I’ve had Ann in talking about the white seal, & wanting me to read to her. And how Karin manages to be so aloof I can’t think. There’s a quality in their minds to me very adorable: to be alone with them, & see them day to day would be an extraordinary experience. They have what no grown up has—that directness—chatter, chatter chatter, on Ann goes, in a kind of world of her own, with its seals & dogs; happy because she’s going to have cocoa tonight, & go blackberrying tomorrow: the walls of her mind all hung round with such bright vivid things, & she doesn’t see what we see. But I’m forgetting Marjorie & only scribble till, as I hope in 15 minutes, the gate goes & L. comes. We have lost £100 a year, & he need no longer attend the office—a great gain. Now I hope for his book. I also begin to cherish dreams of retiring to a lovely house in the country, & there writing—once we get the press on its feet, & Dadie attendant. This recalls Marjorie. I thought her flimsy & cheap in 1917, enough, at first, with this harping on the niceness or nastiness of young men, which becomes so dreary. Then she said, I’ve left Cyril. The upshot of the affair is that we have to engage her as sec. at £3 a week. She depends absolutely on that. Then where is she to live? in Bloomsbury, with a girl—Its all chaotic & precipitous, & like a modern novel; but I suppose she will marry Tom Marshall."
1924.10.17,"It is disgraceful. I did run up stairs thinking I’d make time to enter that astounding fact—the last words of the last page of Mrs Dalloway; but was interrupted. Anyhow I did them a week ago yesterday. “For there she was.” & I felt glad to be quit of it, for it has been a strain the last weeks, yet fresher in the head; with less I mean of the usual feeling that I’ve shaved through, & just kept my feet on the tight rope. I feel indeed rather more fully relieved of my meaning than usual—whether this will stand when I re-read is doubtful. But in some ways this book is a feat; finished without break from illness, wh. is an exception; & written really, in one year; & finally, written from the end of March to the 8th of October without more than a few days break for writing journalism. So it may differ from the others. Anyhow, I feel that I have exorcised the spell wh. Murry & others said I had laid myself under after Jacob’s Room. The only difficulty is to hold myself back from writing others. My cul-de-sac, as they called it, stretches so far, & shows such vistas. I see already The Old Man.

But enough, enough—yet of what should I write here except my writing? Odd how conventional morality always encroaches. One must not talk of oneself &c; one must not be vain &c. Even in complete privacy these ghosts slip between me & the page. But I must here break off to go to the post, down that wonderful lamplit street, which has become more lovely more unreal through my double windows. And I sit shielded within. This house is now perfect. The studio the best study I’ve ever had.

The thought of Katherine Mansfield comes to me—as usual rather reprehensibly—first wishing she could see Southampton Row, thinking of the dulness of her death, lying there at Fontainebleau—an end where there was no end, & then thinking yes, if she’d lived, she’d have written on, & people would have seen that I was the more gifted—that wd. only have become more & more apparent. Indeed, so I suppose it would. I think of her in this way off & on—that strange ghost, with the eyes far apart, & the drawn mouth, dragging herself across her room. And Murry married again to a woman who spends an hour in the W.C. & so the Anreps have turned them out. Murry whines publicly for a flat in the Adelphi. Thats a sordid page of my life by the way, Murry. But I stick to it; K. & I had our relationship; & never again shall I have one like it.

Lytton dined here the other night—a successful evening. Oh I was right to be in love with him 12 or 15 years ago. It is an exquisite symphony his nature when all the violins get playing as they did the other night; so deep, so fantastic. We rambled easily. He is in love again with Philip Ritchie. And hurt, a little; still capable of pain; but knows it now ridiculous, which hurts him too. & he feels it. For when I asked if we could help he was touched. We talked of his writing, & I think now he will write another book; of mine; of the School of Proust, he said; then of Maynard; one side of him detestable; should have married Barbara; grown fat; of Nessa’s picture, which he may buy (I want to see Nessa at this moment, & she’s gone to Norfolk to look at a house, & I hope she won’t take it, & leave London & Charleston & live till she dies, with her children painting in Norfolk & I here, & L. may go to India— thats been brooding over me since I came back & he told me at tea the first afternoon, Saturday, how he’d been asked to go by the ILP & wanted very much to go, & take a week off to see Hambantota which a little hurt me. But I said to myself this is a side of life I’ve not lain on. I must face that too. Still nothing has been heard, though I still a little dread the mornings post, but this is concealed from L.—if he went, it would be after the Election, in Nov. Yes, after the Election, for owing to the defeat of the Govt, in the Campbell Case, we are now condemned to a dose of lies every morning: the usual yearly schoolboys wrangle has begun. If I were still a feminist, I should make capital out of the wrangle. But I have travelled on—as K.M. said to me, she saw me as a ship far out at sea. But K.M. always said affectionate admiring things to me, poor woman, whom in my own way I suppose I loved. Human affections are not to be called by very strong, or rather very positive names, I think. Heres poor old Jacques writing to me, & Gwen wants to come & see me, after 11 years: a relationship revived by the art of the pen, across France. I rather dread revivals: partly vanity; you’re fatter, less beautiful; changed; so self-conscious [?] am I; & then—the effort. Seeing people, now I see them so easily, is an effort. Why——

Phil Baker is standing as a Labour candidate. Irene will have his teeth filed & get him in—(a scrap of real dialogue). Did I put down my progress towards Perpetual Immortality (to quote one of Peggy Webling’s wishes as a child—a Brief I’m doing, or should be doing?) I asked Todd £10 for 1,000 words: she orders 4 articles at that fee: Harper wishes me (I think) to write an American Browns & Bennetts; & Vogue, (via Dadie) is going to take up Mrs Woolf, to boom her: &—&—&—So very likely this time next year I shall be one of those people who are, so father said, in the little circle of London Society which represents the Apostles, I think, on a larger scale. Or does this no longer exist? To know everyone worth knowing. I can just see what he meant; just imagine being in that position—if women can be. Lytton is: Maynard; Ld Balfour; not perhaps Hardy. Which reminds me I ought to dash in Mrs Hardy in a nursing home, having had her tumour cut out; with Miss Charlotte Mew. Nothing very exciting, even as a boast not very exciting now. H. remembers your father: did not like many people, but was fond of him; talks of him often. Would like to know you. But I cant easily fit into that relation; the daughter grateful for old compliments to her father. Yet I should like to see him; to hear him—say something. But what? One or two words about a flower, or a view, or a garden chair, perhaps.

(It strikes me that in this book I practise writing; do my scales; yes & work at certain effects. I daresay I practised Jacob here,—& Mrs D. & shall invent my next book here; for here I write merely in the spirit—great fun it is too, & old V. of 1940 will see something in it too. She will be a woman who can see, old V.: everything—more than I can I think. But I’m tired now.)"
1924.11.01,"I must make some notes of work; for now I must buckle to. The question is how to get the 2 books done. I am going to skate rapidly over Mrs D. but it will take time. No: I cannot say anything much to the point, for what I must do is to experiment next week; how much revision is needed, & how much time it takes. I am very set on getting my essays out before my novel. Yesterday I had tea in Mary’s room & saw the red lighted tugs go past & heard the swish of the river: Mary in black with lotus leaves round her neck. If one could be friendly with women, what a pleasure—the relationship so secret & private compared with relations with men. Why not write about it? truthfully? As I think, this diary writing has greatly helped my style; loosened the ligatures.

We had a party the other night—S. Sassoon; R. Mortimer, Duncan, Vanessa. Nancy Cunard should have come—the little anxious flibbertigibbet with the startled honest eyes, & all the green stones hung about her. We met at Raymond’s, & she slipped into easy desperate-sounding chatter, as if she didn’t mind saying everything—everything—had no shadows no secret places—lived like a lizard in the sun, & yet was by nature for the shade. And I should be re-reading her poem to choose a title. As usual, I am, or think myself, snowed under with work to do; & this is cut into by hours of solid pleasure—going to the pictures tonight; & Suggia on Monday. For its music I want; to stimulate & suggest.

We went to Hamspray on a wet misty day, & saw what the view might be in the sun; a flat meadow with trees in groups like people talking leading to the downs. We walked to the top with Carrington; but the young men, P. Ritchie & Senhouse, are a little simple minded—for Lytton likes that sort, & thus blankets himself. Carrington was as if recently beaten by Ralph. Is she really rather dull, I asked myself? or merely a sun flower out of the sun? We came home in the rain, & a man stopped L. to ask if his dog was a bitch: an angler, he was, & I wanted to ask had he caught a fish. We travelled down with Sydney. Being rather ashamed of my temper—for one should never wall off people on theory—I was affable, yet discreet. Talked the whole time, but did not suggest future meetings. We hit it off successfully I think. Did I want John Franklin to be lenient to Mrs Dalloway? Not, I think, very seriously, & I see no harm in being faithful to old semi-friendships. His little boy is what he cares for, I imagine; & there was less protestation than usual. Murry is “tremendous” on Keats & Sh⁠[akespea]⁠re; Lawrence “tremendous” too; but a megalomaniac. They started a publishing house, like ours; which went smash, or never started, which had killed Kot’s hopes; & Lawrence, who thought the whole of London would flock after him to Mexico, has retired there with Brett alone. All this Sydney sees clearly & comicly, but intimates that there are depths beneath. I rather think the poor monster is clambering out, though. Now, for goodness sake, let me read a little—It is reading, not writing, that suffers in London—"
1924.11.18,"Lady Colefax interrupts. I ask her to call me Virginia—so there.

What I was going to say was that I think writing must be formal. The art must be respected. This struck me reading some of my notes here, for, if one lets the mind run loose, it becomes egotistic: personal, which I detest; like Robert Graves. At the same time the irregular fire must be there; & perhaps to loose it, one must begin by being chaotic, but not appear in public like that. I am driving my way through the mad chapters of Mrs D. My wonder is whether the book would have been better without them. But this is an afterthought, consequent upon learning how to deal with her. Always I think at the end, I see how the whole ought to have been written.

Lady Colefax has made me tremble. I cannot write. We were, I was rather, at Mary’s farewell party last night, & suffer today— having, first, broken my watch, at 3.15 owing to a policeman calling; I having hotted water over the fire in the basement, being infinitely cold & as if rolled in sand, which misery still persists. The upper classes pretended to be clever. Duff Cooper, Lady Diana & all that set, as they say; & my chief amusement came from seeing them as a set. That is the only merit of these parties, that individuals compose differently from what they do in private. One sees groups; gets wholes; general impressions: from the many things being combined. No doubt Proust could say what I mean—that great writer whom I cannot read when I’m correcting, so persuasive is he. He makes it seem easy to write well; which only means that one is slipping along on borrowed skates. So Henry James gives one an unreal impetus; witness my writing after reading him, & Miss Bosanquet.

Dadie came back yesterday & we had a jolly afternoon—oh infinitely better than a party at River House!—lie though I did to Mary on the telephone, doing up Freud. I in two jackets, for it is freezing, & hair down; he in shirtsleeves. Thus one gets to know people; sucks the marrow out, not poised on the edge of a chair on the slippery floor, trying to laugh, & being spurred by wine & sugar cakes. Clive of course changes into an upper class man very loud, familiar, & dashing at once. Lytton sits in his own green shade, only emerging when the gentle youths come in. Philip Ritchie thinks rather too highly of himself, as notice from Lytton always makes them. I was impressed by Nessa, who went to this party for which we were all titivating & dressing up, in her old red brown dress which I think she made herself. (Thinking it over, I believe its getting the rhythm in writing that matters. Could I get my tomorrow mornings rhythm right—take the skip of my sentence at the right moment—I should reel it off;—there is a good deal in this which I should like to think out; its not style exactly—the right words—its a way of levitating the thought out of one—Thank God I hear L.’s key: Grizzle gets up & stands still: now wags; & then trots to the door. A very cold damp foggy night.) But I was saying that I admired Nessa’s utter independence of what people say, which triumphs, over all the tubular cropheads. Elizabeth"
1924.12.13,"Ponsonby, no doubt I meant to add. But that is all faded out. And this diary may die, not of London, but of the Press. For 14 days we have been in the thick of a long press revolution—Dadie going Marjorie going, Marjorie staying, Angus Davidson coming. That is the final result, but achieved only at the cost of 40 million words. For my own part, I could never see Dadie as a permanent partner, Dadie in his silver grey suits, pink shirts, with his powdered pink & white face, his nerves, his manners, his love of praise. Angus, however, after 3 days, already seems to me permanent & dependable. As I always talk of money here, & compliments & rebuffs, first I will own that my pamphlet is the worst seller of them all, then that Harper’s offer me “at least £50” for a Times leader article! And once upon a time I was trying to get £15 out of Jack Squire! So I am suggesting 3 articles a year, to Richmond; & this, if it fructifies, will help us on the road to giving up the Nation, to which goal I look always, though the place has many perquisites.

I am now galloping over Mrs Dalloway, re-typing it entirely from the start, which is more or less what I did with the V.O. a good method, I believe, as thus one works with a wet brush over the whole, & joins parts separately composed & gone dry. Really & honestly I think it the most satisfactory of my novels (but have not read it coldbloodedly yet). The reviewers will say that it is disjointed because of the mad scenes not connecting with the Dalloway scenes. And I suppose there is some superficial glittery writing. But is it “unreal”? Is it mere accomplishment? I think not. And as I think I said before, it seems to leave me plunged deep in the richest strata of my mind. I can write & write & write now: the happiest feeling in the world.

A London winter is full of bright rooms, passages through dark streets to scenes of brilliancy; but I only recall tea’s with Ethel Sands, a lunch with Ly Colefax, Sybil by the way she is now, a party last night at Gumbo [Marjorie Strachey]’s, which being undress & easy going gave me a good deal of pleasure. Ray is precisely like a very fine tabby, which, having been castrated, has grown to an enormous size, & never moves. She sits smiling out of her green blue cats eyes. She is sending us, rather to my trepidation, her new novel. There was also Julia Strachey whom I cross examined; the gifted wastrel. Leys & Vita are both in great demand, Simkin ordering them urgently this morning, & Angus going off in a hurry. But I will not let the Press entirely devour This quarrel has been made up this page. I am rather cross with Marjorie [Joad], about her objecting to my criticism of her private life; & then taking 3 weeks holiday, which will leave us very little, & heaven knows when. But then she seems in a state of nerves—terrified of getting ill, terrified of leaving us, jumpy, unhappy, now on edge, now obsequious, having Tom Marshall about the place, & Ralph Wright & Cyril to divorce, which, to my thinking, distract her mind from her work, & lessen my chances of selling my books. But the thing to aim at is an impersonal, amicable business relation I am sure, now we have Angus, less sympathy & more work.

Whatever they may say, Vita & Clive & Lytton, people crowd to the press, & can’t be beaten off. Bernadette Murphy was ready to come. Angus dropped like ripe fruit from the tree. Vita explains that the Heir of Redcliffe, her cousin, implores her to resist the contamination of Bloomsbury, personified in the serpent destroyer, V.W. I half like, half mind this."
1924.12.21,"Really it is a disgrace—the number of blank pages in this book! The effect of London on diaries is decidedly bad. This is I fancy the leanest of them all, & I doubt that I can take it to Rodmell, or if I did, whether I could add much. Indeed it has been an eventful year, as I prophesied; & the dreamer of Jan. 3rd has dreamt much of her dream true; here we are in London, with Nelly alone, Dadie gone it is true, but Angus to replace him. What emerges is that changing houses is not so cataclysmic as I thought; after all one doesn’t change body or brain. Still I am absorbed in “my writing”, putting on a spurt to have Mrs D. copied for L. to read at Rodmell; & then in I dart to deliver the final blows to the Common Reader, & then—then I shall be free. Free at least to write out one or two more stories which have accumulated. I am less & less sure that they are stories, or what they are. Only I do feel fairly sure that I am grazing as near as I can to my own ideas, & getting a tolerable shape for them. I think there is less & less wastage. But I have my ups & downs. As for fame & money, Clive’s long article on me is out in The Dial. £50, apparently, from Harper. Clearly, as L. said, we are safe to make, both of us, as much as we want by our pens. Never again, I daresay, shall we agitate about getting £15 from Jack Squire.

So much of my time goes talking—talking to strays in the basement, to particular people like Ethel Sands, Elena Richmond, Vita, up here, that when I write, I tend to meditate; to sing my own praises, & sum up the months work.

How sharply society brings one out—or rather others out! Roger the other night with Vita for instance. He became the nonconformist undergraduate at once, the obstinate young man, (I could see him quite young with his honest uncompromising eyes) who will not say what he does not believe to be true. The effect on Vita was disastrous; & pure honesty is a doubtful quality; it means often lack of imagination. It means self assertiveness, being rather better than other people; a queer trait in Roger to unearth after so many years of smooth intercourse. For the most part he is so sympathetic. His Quaker blood protests against Vita’s rich winy fluid; & she has the habit of praising & talking indiscriminately about art, which goes down in her set, but not in ours. It was all very thorny until that good fellow Clive came in, & addressed himself to conciliate dear old obtuse, aristocratic, passionate, Grenadier like Vita. Then came Sprott; a dull dog if ever there was one.

We have also seen Aldington, who calls like a tradesman for orders; a bluff, powerful, rather greasy eyed, nice downright man, who will make his way in the world, which I dont much like people to do. All young men do it. No young women; or in women it is trounced; in men forgiven. Its these reflections I want to enmesh, in writing; or these are among them.

Marjorie & I kissed—there above the little grave we kissed again with tears. My coldness, she said, had made it impossible for her to work. We explained, standing in the doorway. I like her; I like her inner integrity, after cutting through that rather cheap, bargain counter like surface.

All our Bloomsbury relationships flourish, grow in lustiness. Suppose our set to survive another 20 years, I tremble to think how thickly knit & grown together it will be. At Christmas I must write & ask Lytton if I may dedicate the common reader to him. And thats the last of my books to be dedicated, I think. What do we talk about? I wish I could write conversations.

With Elena we discussed women’s dress; she sitting there so matronly & ornate, in a S. Kensington way, with pearls, & a tiger trimmed black coat, all black, substantial, & middleaged.

“I love driving. I went with my grandmother on a driving tour, with Kentish horses. We did about 20 miles a day. I was at a party the other night when everyone said how charming Mrs Carnegie (you remember Mrs Chamberlain, Virginia?) looked, dressed in a fitting pink dress, cut low: every single woman in the room was dressed in a chemisette dress of georgette.” Dadie was a great success. “That enchanting creature” she called him, relieved I think to meet a human being here.

Vita talked about criticism. Ly G. Wellesley wants to found a 2nd Hawthornden prize for poets only. I said it should be for critics. What are critics, said Vita; & added, being engagingly a student of reviews of her own books, a little ink steeped indeed, that no two critics took the same view. This started Roger on aesthetic criticism, constructive criticism.

We go over the same things, undoubtedly. The press however is always casting up wreckage. People come most days. I enjoy my printing afternoons, & think it the sanest way of life—for if I were always writing, or merely recouping from writing, I should be like an inbreeding rabbit,—my progeny becoming weakly albinos. A man called Peter Miller met at Gumbo’s confirmed me in this the other night. One meets a good many men now. Theres a little thrush like creature called Tomlin who wants to sculpt me. This afternoon they cut down the tree at the back the tree I used to see from my basement skylight."
1925.01.06,"The disgraceful truth is that I shall run year into year, for I cant waste so many blank pages.

What a flourish I began 1924 with! And today, for the 165th time, Nelly has given notice—Won’t be dictated to: must do as other girls do. This is the fruit of Bloomsbury. On the whole, I’m inclined to take her at her word. The nuisance of arranging life to suit her fads, & the pressure of ‘other girls’ is too much, good cook though she is, & honest, crusty old maid too, dependable, in the main, affectionate, kindly, but incurably fussy, nervy, unsubstantial. Anyhow, the servant question no longer much worries me.

Last night we dined at 3 Albert Road Mary’s new villa. I like the new year to begin with warm friendly feelings—& it was a superb dinner. There were the children too, a nice girl & boy; a girl with lovely womans eyes, sympathetic, startled; & wild like a girl. (I want to begin to describe my own sex.) What do I mean about the expression? Extreme youth, & yet, one felt, this feeling has been existing forever; very feminine. Here I conceive my story—but I’m always conceiving stories now. Short ones—scenes—for instance The Old Man (a character of L.S.) The Professor on Milton—(an attempt at literary criticism) & now The Interruption, women talking alone. However, back to life. Where are we?

I spent this morning writing a note on an E⁠[lizabe]⁠than play—for which I have been reading plays all this year. Then I found the minute hand of my watch had come off (this was talking to Lytton about [Samuel] Richardson last night—I found it off then): so I went into the printing room to see the time—found Angus & Leonard doing Simkin’s bill. Stayed & laughed. L. went off to the office, when we had dog-walked round the Square. I came in & set a page of Nancy. Then out to Ingersoll to get my watch mended. Then dog walked. Then here. It being a black grained winter day; lengths of the pavement ink black where not lighted. Never shall I describe all the days I have noticed. I cannot hit it off, quite, & yet perhaps if I read this again I shall see what. I meant then.

Rodmell was all gale & flood; these words are exact. The river overflowed. We had 7 days rain out of 10. Often I could not face a walk. L. pruned, which needed heroic courage. My heroism was purely literary. I revised Mrs D⁠[alloway]: the dullest part of the whole business of writing; the most depressing & exacting. The worst part is at the beginning (as usual) where the aeroplane has it all to itself for some pages, & it wears thin. L. read it; thinks it my best—but then has he not got to think so? Still I agree. He thinks it has more continuity than J⁠[acob]⁠s R⁠[oom]. but is difficult owing to the lack of connection, visible; between the two themes.

Anyhow it is sent off to Clarks, & proofs will come next week. This is for Harcourt Brace, who has accepted without seeing & raised me to 15 p.c.

I did not see very much at Rodmell, having to keep my eyes on the typewriter.

Angus was with us for Christmas, a very quiet, very considerate, unselfish deliberate young man, with a charming sense of humour—colourless, Lytton says: passive. But I think well of him, all the same."
1925.03.18,"These last pages belong to the Common Reader, & were written in bed with influenza; & now, at last, having sent off the last proofs today, I have got my new diary made, & shall close this, with a thousand apologies, & some ominous forebodings at the sight of all the blank pages.

[Diary XIV:]

52 Tavistock Square WC

1925"
1925.03.18,"This disgrace has been already explained—I think: two books to see through the press, mainly between tea & dinner; influenza, & a distaste for the pen.

At the moment (I have 7½ before dinner) I can only note that the past is beautiful because one never realises an emotion at the time. It expands later, & thus we don’t have complete emotions about the present, only about the past. This struck me on Reading platform, watching Nessa & Quentin kiss, he coming up shyly, yet with some emotion. This I shall remember; & make more of, when separated from all the business of crossing the platform, finding our bus &c. That is why we dwell on the past, I think.

We went to see the children at school: the young men, I should say. Julian was shut up in a pound, pounding Mr Eliot’s tennis court by way of punishment. (That suggests a story about a man whose ambition it was to buy a field; this kept him alive; when he bought it, he died.) Mr Goddard came up, & Julian shouted out, “I’m at it till 5” as though they were undergraduates. Not much public school about this; but oh the horror of being Mr Goddard, & wandering out, this bitter day (it snowed) to welcome home the steeplechasers. When they ran in, they at once rolled on the ground, & were covered with rugs & coats. The last lap, their legs rose very weakly. J. & Q. were utterly cynical about this, & said no one enjoyed it, but it was thought the right thing to do. But this nib scratches."
1925.04.08,"Just back from Cassis. Often while I was there I thought how I would write here frequently & so get down some of the myriad impressions which I net every day. But directly we get back, what is it that happens? We strip & dive into the stream, & I am obsessed with a foolish idea that I have no time to stop & write, or that I ought to be doing something serious. Even now, I pelt along feverishly, thinking half the time, but I must stop & take Grizzle [dog] out; I must get my American books in order; the truth is, I must try to set aside half an hour in some part of my day, & consecrate it to diary writing. Give it a name & a place, & then perhaps, such is the human mind, I shall come to think it a duty, & disregard other duties for it.

I am under the impression of the moment, which is the complex one of coming back home from the South of France to this wide dim peaceful privacy—London (so it seemed last night) which is shot with the accident I saw this morning & a woman crying Oh oh oh faintly, pinned against the railings with a motor car on top of her. All day I have heard that voice. I did not go to her help; but then every baker & flower seller did that. A great sense of the brutality & wildness of the world remains with me—there was this woman in brown walking along the pavement—suddenly a red film car turns a somersault, lands on top of her, & one hears this oh, oh, oh. I was on my way to see Nessa’s new house, & met Duncan in the square, but as he had seen nothing, he could not in the least feel what I felt, or Nessa either, though she made some effort to connect it with Angelica’s accident last spring. But I assured her it was only a passing brown woman; & so we went over the house composedly enough.

Since I wrote, which is these last months, Jacques Raverat has died; after longing to die; & he sent me a letter about Mrs Dalloway which gave me one of the happiest days of my life. I wonder if this time I have achieved something? Well, nothing anyhow compared with Proust, in whom I am embedded now. The thing about Proust is his combination of the utmost sensibility with the utmost tenacity. He searches out these butterfly shades to the last grain. He is as tough as catgut & as evanescent as a butterfly’s bloom. And he will I suppose both influence me & make me out of temper with every sentence of my own. Jacques died, as I say; & at once the siege of emotions began. I got the news with a party here—Clive, Bee How, Julia Strachey, Dadie. Nevertheless, I do not any longer feel inclined to doff the cap to death. I like to go out of the room talking, with an unfinished casual sentence on my lips. That is the effect it had on me—no leavetakings, no submission—but someone stepping out into the darkness. For her though the nightmare was terrific. All I can do now is to keep natural with her, which is I believe a matter of considerable importance. More & more do I repeat my own version of Montaigne “Its life that matters”.

I am waiting to see what form of itself Cassis will finally cast up in my mind. There are the rocks. We used to go out after breakfast & sit on the rocks, with the sun on us. L. used to sit without a hat, writing on his knee. One morning he found a sea urchin—they are red, with spikes which quiver slightly. Then we would go a walk in the afternoon, right up over the hill, into the woods, where one day we heard the motor cars & discovered the road to La Ciota⁠[t] just beneath. It was stony, steep & very hot. We heard a great chattering birdlike noise once, & I bethought me of the frogs. The ragged red tulips were out in the fields; all the fields were little angular shelves cut out of the hill, & ruled & ribbed with vines; & all red, & rosy & purple here & there with the spray of some fruit tree in bud. Here & there was an angular white, or yellow or blue washed house, with all its shutters tightly closed; & flat paths round it, & once rows of stocks; an incomparable cleanness & definiteness everywhere. At La Ciota⁠[t] great orange ships rose up out of the blue water of the little bay. All these bays are very circular, & fringed with the pale coloured plaster houses, very tall, shuttered, patched & peeled, now with a pot & tufts of green on them, now with clothes, drying; now an old old woman looking. On the hill, which is stony as a desert, the nets were drying; & then in the streets children & girls gossiped & meandered all in pale bright shawls & cotton frocks, while the men picked up the earth of the main square to make a paved court of it. The Hotel Cendrillon is a white house, with red tiled floors, capable of housing perhaps 8 people. There were Miss Toogood, the Howards, Miss Betsy Roberts, Mr Gurney, Mr Francis &, finally, Mr Hugh Anderson & Mr Garrow Tomlin. All deserve pages of description. And then the whole hotel atmosphere provided me with many ideas: oh so cold, indifferent, superficially polite, & exhibiting such odd relationships: as if human nature were now reduced to a kind of code, which it has devised to meet these emergencies, where people who do not know each other meet, & claim their rights as members of the same tribe. As a matter of fact, we got into touch all round; but our depths were not invaded. But L. & I were too too happy, as they say; if it were now to die &c. Nobody shall say of me that I have not known perfect happiness, but few could put their finger on the moment, or say what made it. Even I myself, stirring occasionally in the pool of content, could only say But this is all I want; could not think of anything better; & had only my half superstitious feeling as the Gods who must when they have created happiness, grudge it. Not if you get it in unexpected ways though."
1925.04.19,"It is now after dinner, our first summer time night, & the mood for writing has left me, only just brushed me & left me. I have not achieved my sacred half hour yet. But think—in time to come I would rather read something here than reflect that I did polish off Mr Ring Lardner successfully. I’m out to make £300 this summer by writing, & build a bath & hot water range at Rodmell. But, hush, hush—my books tremble on the verge of coming out, & my future is uncertain. As for forecasts—its just on the cards Mrs Dalloway is a success (Harcourt thinks it “wonderful”), & sells 2,000—I dont expect it: I expect a slow silent increase of fame, such has come about, rather miraculously, since Js R. was published; my value mounting steadily as a journalist, though scarcely a copy sold. And I am not very nervous—rather; & I want as usual to dig deep down into my new stories, without having a looking glass flashed in my eyes Todd, to wit; Colefax to wit et cetera.

Lytton came in the other night. He seemed to me autumnal; with that charming rectitude of spirit which no one else attains so perfectly I think. His justice of mind is considerable. But Christ is dismissed, to his disappointment, for he grows more & more fussy about subjects: Christ, he says did not exist: was a figment; & so much is known that really he couldn’t pull it all together in one book. Then perhaps Philip Ritchie is waning. We talked of old buggers & their lack of attraction for young men. My anti-bugger revolution has run round the world, as I hoped it would. I am a little touched by what appears their contrition, & anxiety to condone their faults. Yet if I cant say what’s in my mind, & have a fling with Clive’s Colonel now & then, what’s the use of me? The pale star of the Bugger has been in the ascendant too long. Julian agrees emphatically. We had Good Friday at Rodmell—June weather, & again this downy billowy wave beneath us: ah, but how quickly I sink; what violet shadows there are between the high lights, & one, perhaps, as unreasonable as another. But this properly belongs to a story.

Yesterday we went to Max’s show with dear shabby old Angus, who seems to me an elder brother, 20 years younger than I am. We came back to tea (over all this the bloom of the past descends as I write—it becomes sad, beautiful, memorable) & ate a great many buns, & then discussed Murphy. Alas!—she has a temper. She is an ill-conditioned mongrel woman, of no charm, a Bohemian scallywag, something like Irish stew to look at, & not destined for a long life here, I suppose. But Angus, though plaintive is gentlemanly; does not insist, & sees the drawbacks; Leonard will have to pull out the tooth on Thursday. I suspect some hidden grievance: I suspect she harbours scores.

Marjory & her Tom looked in at the basement this evening, very happy, L. says, & indeed I think she must enjoy her situation to the last ounce—money, food, security, & a supply of young men, & her faithful Tom, & a little dress allowance, & breakfast late, & consideration. She is a nice trusty creature into the bargain, & if I wished to see anyone, I daresay it would be her.

At this moment, all we wish is to escape seeing anyone. Tomorrow I shall buy a new dress. I observe here that I am becoming jerky & jumpy, & my conscience is asserting that I ought to read Mr Ring Lardner & earn my 50 guineas."
1925.04.20,"Happiness is to have a little string onto which things will attach themselves. For example, going to my dressmaker in Judd Street, or rather thinking of a dress I could get her to make, & imagining it made—that is the string, which as if it dipped loosely into a wave of treasure brings up pearls sticking to it. Poor Murphy is in the glumps, owing to Leonard’s fiery harshness—each of which epithets he would most certainly deny. She has no string dipping into the green wave: things don’t connect for her; & add up into those entrancing bundles which are happiness. And my days are likely to be strung with them. I like this London life in early summer—the street sauntering & square haunting, & then if my books (I never speak of L.’s pamphlet) were to be a success; if we could begin building at Monks, & put up wireless for Nelly, & get the Skeats to live at Shanks’ cottage—if—if—if—What will happen is some intensities of pleasure, some profound plunges of gloom. Bad reviews, being ignored; & then some delicious clap of compliment. But really what I should like would be to have £3 to buy a pair of rubber soled boots, & go for country walks on Sundays.

One thing in considering my state of mind now, seems to me beyond dispute, that I have at last, bored down into my oil well, & can’t scribble fast enough to bring it all to the surface. I have now at least 6 stories welling up in me, & feel, at last, that I can coin all my thoughts into words. Not but what an infinite number of problems remain; but I have never felt this rush & urgency before. I believe I can write much more quickly: if writing it is—this dash at the paper of a phrase, & then the typing & retyping—trying it over, the actual writing being now like the sweep of a brush; I fill it up afterwards. Now suppose I might become one of the interesting—I will not say great—but interesting novelists? Oddly, for all my vanity, I have not until now had much faith in my novels, or thought them my own expression."
1925.04.27,"The Common Reader was out on Thursday: this is Monday, & so far I have not heard a word about it, private or public: it is as if one tossed a stone into a pond, & the waters closed without a ripple. And I am perfectly content, & care less than I have ever cared, & make this note just to remind me next time of the sublime progress of my books. I have been sitting to Vogue, the Becks that is, in their mews, which Mr Woolner built as his studio, & perhaps it was there he thought of my mother, whom he wished to marry, I think. But my present second selves is what I mean reflection is that people have any number of states of consciousness: & I should like to investigate the party consciousness, the frock consciousness &c. The fashion world at the Becks—Mrs Garland was there superintending a display—is certainly one; where people secrete an envelope which connects them & protects them from others, like myself, who am outside the envelope, foreign bodies. These states are very difficult (obviously I grope for words) but I’m always coming back to it. The party consciousness, for example: Sybil’s consciousness. You must not break it. It is something real. You must keep it up; conspire together. Still I cannot get at what I mean. Then I meant to dash off Graves before I forget him.

Figure a bolt eyed blue shirted shockheaded hatless man in a blue overcoat standing goggling at the door at 4.30, on Friday. “Mrs Woolf?” I dreading & suspecting some Nation genius, some young man determined to unbosom himself, rushed him to the basement, where he said “I’m Graves”. “I’m Graves”. Everybody stared. He appeared to have been rushing through the air at 60 miles an hour & to have alighted temporarily. So he came up, &, wily as I am, I knew that to advance holding the kettle in a dishclout was precisely, the right method, attitude, pose. The poor boy is all emphasis protestation & pose. He has a crude likeness to Shelley, save that his nose is a switchback & his lines blurred. But the consciousness of genius is bad for people. He stayed till 7.15 (we were going to Caesar & Cleopatra—a strange rhetorical romantic early Shaw play) & had at last to say so, for he was so thick in the delight of explaining his way of life to us that no bee stuck faster to honey. He cooks, his wife cleans; 4 children are brought up in the elementary school; the villagers give them vegetables; they were married in Church; his wife calls herself Nancy Nicolson; won’t go to Garsington, said to him I must have a house for nothing; on a river; in a village with a square church tower; near but not on a railway—all of which, as she knows her mind, he procured. Calling herself Nicolson has sorted her friends into sheep & goats. All this to us sounded like the usual self consciousness of young men, especially as he threw in, gratuitously, the information that he descends from dean rector, Bishop, Von Ranker &c &c &c: only in order to say that he despises them. Still, still, he is a nice ingenuous rattle headed young man; but why should our age put this burden of proof on us? Surely once one could live simply without protestations. I tried, perhaps, to curry favour, as my weakness is. L. was adamant. Then we were offered a ticket for the Cup tie, to see wh. Graves has come to London after 6 years; cant travel in a train without being sick; is rather proud of his sensibility. No I don’t think he’ll write great poetry: but what will you? The sensitive are needed too; the halfbaked, stammering stuttering, who perhaps improve their own quarter of Oxfordshire.

And on Sunday we had our first walk, to Epping."
1925.04.29,"Hastily (Moore waiting) I must record the fact of Tom’s long gaslit emotional rather tremulous & excited visit last night, which informed us of his release (But I have not yet sent in my demission) from the Bank; some heavensent appointment, providing “4/5th’s of my present salary” & a guarantee, being “humanly speaking” certain, to take effect next October—whether Lady Rothermere (who has become ‘very nice’) or the 4ly review, he sayeth not. Then he has a house near Sloane Sqre in view, rent £58 only, & so hopes to start fresh, & has been thinking over his state these past weeks, being alone, with time on his hands. He has seen his whole life afresh, seen his relations to the world, & to Vivien in particular, become humbler suppler more humane—good, sensitive honourable man as he is, accusing himself of being the American husband, & wishing to tell me privately (L. gone to fetch the letters) what store V. sets by me, has done nothing but write since last June, because I told her to! He then defended not writing which is her device he said, & went into her psychology. Then he said to L. (having told us that he must space his remarks very carefully to fit in all he had to say) Do you know anything about psycho-analysis? L. said yes, in his responsible way; & Tom then told us the queer story—how Martin the dr. set V. off thinking of her childhood terror of loneliness, & now she cant let him, Tom, out of her sight. There he has sat mewed in her room these 3 months, poor pale creature, or if he has to go out, comes in to find her in a half fainting state.

“Tomorrow will be wretched” he said, for he was now away from 8 to 11. We advised another doctor. But whether its doctors or sense or holiday or travel or some drastic method unknown thats to cure that little nervous self conscious bundle—heaven knows. She has the abstract, he the historic mind he said. The upshot was a queer sense of his emotion in coming to tell us all this—something not merely touching to my vanity but to my sense of human worth, I think; his liking for us, affection, trust in Leonard, & being so much at his ease in some subconscious way he said, not in conversation, with me, all making me lay my arm on his shoulder; not a very passionate caress, but the best I can do.

And now I’m a little fidgety about the Common Reader, not a single word of it from a soul, & perhaps a Review in the Lit Sup tomorrow. But this is quite recognisably superficial; beneath my fidgets being considerable stability."
1925.05.01,"This is a note for future reference as they say. The Common Reader came out 8 days ago, & so far not a single review has appeared, & no body has written to me or spoken to me about it or in any way acknowledged the fact of its existence; save Maynard, Lydia, & Duncan. Clive is conspicuously dumb; Mortimer has flu & cant review it; Nancy saw him reading it, but reported no opinion: all signs which point to a dull chill depressing reception; & complete failure. I have just come through the hoping fearing stage, & now see my disappointment floating like an old bottle in my wake & am off on fresh adventures. Only if the same thing happens to Dalloway one need not be surprised. But I must write to Gwen."
1925.05.04,"This is the temperature chart of a book. We went to Cambridge, & Goldie said he thought me the finest living critic: the paralysed man, Hayward, said, in his jerky angular way: “Who wrote that extraordinarily good article on the Elizabethans 2 or 3 months ago in the Lit. Sup.?” I pointed to my breast. Now there’s one sneering review in Country Life, almost inarticulate with feebleness, trying to say what a Common reader is, & another, says Angus, in the Star, laughing at Nessa’s cover. So from this I prognosticate a good deal of criticism on the ground that I’m obscure & odd; & some enthusiasm; a slow sale, & an increased reputation. Oh yes—my reputation increases. But I am headachy, & cannot go to a concert with Angus, & Leonard is giving Randall his farewell dinner, & it [is] a relief to sit quiet (the joy of giving up an engagement is supreme) & I wish I could describe Pernel, Cambridge, Braithwaite & Hayward, with a postscript for Thompson. A lovely place full, like all places, now, of this wave of the past. Walking past the Darwins I noticed the willows; I thought with that growing maternal affection which now comes to me, of myself there; of Rupert; then I went to Newnham, & kindled Mrs Palmer with talk of Pernel marrying an Archbishop.

No, I can’t fire it off [?]; Mrs Asquith sticks in my gizzard; I shall read Moore till dinner, & a paper then again till Leonard comes in. No, I dont want to hear Bach, & by giving Angus the tickets, secured him a charming young man for company.

Pernel was easier than I’ve ever known her. We sat over her fire, gossiping—how Kate died, taking the dog for a walk till a week of the end; entirely reserved; like a skeleton, like a dead person walking with sarcoma; no doctor. No mention of herself & the 58 brown diaries burnt, I suppose."
1925.05.09,"Just back from the Greek play at Chiswick with Lydia & Berta Ruck; a fine spring day, all the trees out driving across the Park; that transient journey being founded on a walk with Nessa Clive & Thoby, & Thoby & I agreed in calling Hyde Park ‘urbane’.

As for the Common Reader, the Lit. Sup. had close on 2 columns sober & sensible praise—neither one thing nor the other—my fate in the Times. And Goldie writes that he thinks “this is the best criticism in English—humorous, witty & profound.”—My fate is to be treated to all extremes & all mediocrities. But I never get an enthusiastic review in the Lit. Sup. And it will be the same for Dalloway, which now approaches.

I’m jangled & jaded, having sat next the sea horse Sally Onions, who oozes lust at the sight of young men dancing. Last night we made a meagre meal with the Sangers, whose mediocrity of comfort & taste saddens me: oh for a little beauty, in life, as Berta Ruck might say—a lewd woman that, deposited in a lewd South Kensington House, like an equestrienne, in pale Jacon with a carnation, & her front teeth with a red ridge on them where her lips had touched them. Little Lydia I liked: how does her mind work? Like a lark soaring; a sort of glorified instinct inspires her: I suppose a very nice nature, & direction at Maynard’s hands.

Last night we had Morgan & Brace; Morgan pleading with Leonard to come & see him—operated on for a broken bone in the wrist, I should have added, but it is now"
1925.05.14,"The first day of summer, leaves visibly drawing out of the bud, & the Square almost green. Oh what a country day—& some of my friends are now reading Mrs D. in the country.

I meant to register more of my books temperatures. C.R. does not sell; but is praised. I was really pleased to open the Manchester Guardian this morning & read Mr Fausset on The Art of V.W. Brilliance combined with integrity; profound as well as eccentric. Now if only the Times would speak out thus, but the Times mumbles & murmurs like a man sucking pebbles—did I say that I had nearly 2 mumbling columns on me there? But the odd thing is this: honestly I am scarcely a shade nervous about Mrs D. Why is this? Really I am a little bored, for the first time, at thinking how much I shall have to talk about it this summer. The truth is that writing is the profound pleasure & being read the superficial. I’m now all on the strain with desire to stop journalism & get on to To the Lighthouse. This is going to be fairly short: to have father’s character done complete in it; & mothers; & St Ives; & childhood; & all the usual things I try to put in—life, death &c. But the centre is father’s character, sitting in a boat, reciting We perished, each alone, while he crushes a dying mackerel—However, I must refrain. I must write a few little stories first, & let the Lighthouse simmer, adding to it between tea & dinner till it is complete for writing out.

Yesterday was a terrific chatter day—Desmond on top of Dr Leyes, Lord Olivier on top of Desmond, James & Dadie to finish off with, while L. had I forget how many press interviews & committees into the bargain. The League of Nations is booming (Innes, I mean.) But I meant to describe my dear old Desmond, whom it rejoiced me to see again, & he held out both his hands, & I set him in his chair & we talked till 7 o’clock. He is rather worn & aged; a little, I think, feeling that here’s 45 on him & nothing achieved, except indeed the children, whom he dotes on—Micky to write, Dermod & Rachel trilling & warbling on flute & piano: all his human relations very fertile & flourishing, but oh, he said, talking of Houseman, don’t let him give up the Corn Exchange & take to literature! I saw him thinking of his 50 articles for 5 years, his welter of old articles lying dusty in boxes, & now Geoffrey Scott promoted to do Donne, which Desmond should have done in the year 1912. I remember him telling me the story at Brunswick Square. So I said I would take the thing in hand & see it through which touched him, for children are not enough, after all; one wants something to be made out of oneself alone—& 5 boxes of dusty articles are rather raggy & rotten for 45 years. And he praised the C.R. with enthusiasm; & will write on it, & so we chattered along; Vernon Lee, with her cheap rings in exquisite taste; & her idiomatic Italian; & her spiteful way of seeing things, so that she dare not write her memoirs; Lily Langtry coming down the playhouse steps & her daughter looming behind her, loveliness that “struck me in the breast”; also Logan & Ottoline—how Alys is ill of the cancer again—“a most unhappy miserable life poor woman—” L. having the new Mrs B.R. on one side, would be chafed to death by Ott. next door; but like a fool, Logan made none of this clear, & only complained that the village peace of Chelsea would be destroyed by O. wh. naturally she resented. In all this, Desmond acts as solvent & go between, everyone sponging on his good nature & sense. What else did we discuss? The E⁠[lizabe]⁠thans? The Phoenix; poor Ray Litvin’s miserable big mouth, & little body; when L. came, & then the dinner party, I just having time for a race round the Square; both Dadie & James very easy & affable, indeed for Dadie I feel considerable affection—so sensitive & tender is he, & one of these days will get a pull on himself, & be less of a quicksilver. Indeed, staying on he talked very seriously & excitedly of his dissertation & poets use of words, how they fix on to a word & fill it out with meaning & make it symbolic. But what these scholars want is to get at books through writing books, not through reading them.

But I must remember to write about my clothes next time I have an impulse to write. My love of clothes interests me profoundly: only it is not love; & what it is I must discover."
1925.05.15,"Two unfavourable reviews of Mrs D (Western Mail & Scotsman): unintelligible, not art &c: & a letter from a young man in Earls Court “This time you have done it—you have caught life & put it in a book…” Please forgive this outburst, but further quotation is unnecessary; & I dont think I should bother to write this, if I weren’t jangled what by? The sudden heat, I think, & the racket of life. It is bad for me to see my own photograph. And I have been lunching with Desmond, & reading that dear old Owl’s journalism. The thing is, he cant thrust through an article. Now, Lytton or I, though we mayn’t think better or write better, have a drive in us, which makes an article whole. And yet there are things worth keeping, & he becomes moved, & irrational when he thinks of it, & I want him to be pleased—So we lunched in the grill of the Connaught Rooms where other men were talking business, had a bottle of wine & delved into the filth packets as he calls them. Home to find Vogue sending photographs—more photographs: T.P. wants one, the Morning Post another. & the C.R. sells 2 or 3 copies a day.

We are going to the play out into this tawny coloured London—but journalism is the devil. I cannot write after reading it. No time—& I must change, & write about clothes some day soon."
1925.05.17,"A wire from Raymond in Paris—just read Mrs D. it is quite beautiful—& a very good, outspoken wholly praising review of C. R. in the Observer—“no living critic” &c. But this is not all vanity; I’m recording for curiosity: the fate of a book. The only judgment on Mrs D. I await with trepidation (but thats too strong) is Morgan’s. He will say something enlightening.

Just back (all my days here begin with this) from Sutton. Oh it is full summer weather—so hot one can’t walk on the sunny side, & all London—even Lavender Hill Lambeth which peels visibly in the sun—transmogrified. We had a bad walk, all along the cinder track, with soft footpaths inviting wh. we could not take, owing to L.’s lecture, delivered in a semi-religious sanctuary, with hymns & prayers & a chapter from the Bible. The whole of Sutton was hymning something: soft intense strains of human [word omitted by VW] went warbling about, as I sat; & I was touched & moved by it: the world so beautiful, God’s gift to us, said the Chairman, who looked poor man as if he had never had an ounce of pleasure in his life. Things become very familiar to me, so that I sometimes think humanity is a vast wave, undulating: the same, I mean: the same emotions here that there were at Richmond. Please have some tea—we shall be hurt if you don’t accept our hospitality. Accordingly we do; & the same queer brew of human fellowship, is brewed; & people look the same; & joke in the same way, & come to these odd superficial agreements, wh. if you think of them persisting & wide spread—in jungles, storms, birth & death—are not superficial; but rather profound, I think. We came home on top of a bus all the way for a shilling, with the usual glimpses down lanes, into farmyards, at running streams, persisting in between villas, & behind sunbaked yellow or black motor roads. A little girl on the bus asked her mother how many inches are there in a mile. Her mother repeated this to me. I said you must go to school & they’ll tell you. But she is at school said her mother. She’s seven; & he (the baby on her knee) goes to school. He’s three. So I gave them two biscuits left over, & the little girl (see my egotism) with her bright excitable eyes, & eagerness to grasp the whole universe reminded me of myself, asking questions of my mother. We saw Lambeth, & I imagined the frolics of clergymen in the boscage, which is very thick; crossed Westminster Bridge; admired the Houses of Parliament & their fretted lacy look; passed the Cenotaph, which L. compromised by sitting with his hat off all the way up Whitehall, & so home, passing a nigger gentleman, perfectly fitted out in swallow tail & bowler & gold headed cane; & what were his thoughts? Of the degradation stamped on him, every time he raised his hand & saw it black as a monkeys outside, tinged with flesh colour within?

Yesterday we had tea with Margaret in her new house. There are three poplars, & behind them St Paul’s. But I don’t want to live in the suburbs again. There we sat, & I teased her, & she me, & she minded a little, & got red & then white, as if her centre were not very firm. She is severe to Lilian, who has the small rooms & is not allowed to plant flowers, she said bitterly, for it worries Margaret, & so nothing is done to the garden, which too worries Margaret. For these worries, she takes Ethel M. Dell & Dickens. Why, she said, should D.s characters be like people, when he can create people?—an interesting criticism, I think. We hit it off very well, chiefly owing to my wildness & harum scarumness, I think; & I am very fond of her, & sorry for her, since how awful it would be to ‘retire’ at 60: to sit down & look at poplar trees? Moreover, she once said she had ‘compromised’; her father making entire work impossible; & she now regrets things, I imagine; has seen so little of the world, & carried nothing to the extreme. Lilian irritates too, compared with what she might have had. But, after all, thats enough.

The time is now ripe for dinner. And I must answer some of my admirers. Never have I felt so much admired—so tomorrow, snubs will snub me back again into trim."
1925.05.20,"Well, Morgan admires. This is a weight off my mind. Better than Jacob he says; was sparing of words; kissed my hand, & on going said he was awfully pleased, very happy (or words to that effect) about it. He thinks—but I wont go into detailed criticism: I shall hear more; & this is only about the style being simpler, more like other peoples this time.

I dined with the Sitwells last night. Edith is an old maid. I had never conceived this. I thought she was severe, implacable & tremendous; rigid in her own conception. Not a bit of it. She is, I guess, a little fussy, very kind, beautifully mannered, & a little reminding me of Emphie Case! She is elderly too, almost my age, & timid, & admiring & easy & poor, & I liked her more than admired or was frightened of her. Nevertheless, I do admire her work, & thats what I say of hardly anyone: she has an ear, & not a carpet broom; a satiric vein; & some beauty in her. How one exaggerates public figures! How one makes up a person immune from one’s own pleasures & failings! But Edith is humble: has lived in a park alone till 27, & so described nothing but sights & sounds; then came to London, & is trying to get a little emotion into her poetry—all of which I suspected, & think promising. Then how eager she was to write for the Press, which had always been her great ambition, she said. Nothing could be more conciliatory & less of an eagle than she; odd looking too, with her humorous old maids smile, her half shut eyes, her lank hair, her delicate hands, wearing a large ring, & fine feet, & her brocade dress, blue & silver. Nothing of the protester or pamph⁠[l]⁠eteer or pioneer seemed in her—rather the well born Victorian spinster. So I must read her afresh. There were Francis [Birrell], Raymond [Mortimer], [Arthur] Waley & a little American toad called Towne, who soaked himself in liquor & became almost loving to us all. The three Sitwells have considerable breeding about them; I like their long noses, & grotesque faces. As for the house, Osbert is at heart an English squire, a collector, but of Bristol glass, old fashion plates, Victorian cases of humming birds, & not of foxes brushes & deers horns. His rooms are all stuck about with these objects. And I liked him too. But why are they thought daring & clever? Why are they the laughing stocks of the music halls & the penny a liners?

Not much talk; all easy goodnatured generalities after dinner, Francis bawling, Waley sombre & demure, & I very indulgent with my compliments: & now tomorrows Supt [TLS] & then (here L. came in & told me about R. Macdonald at the Labour party meeting)."
1925.06.01,"Bank holiday, & we are in London. To record my books fates slightly bores me; but now both are floated, & Mrs D. doing surprisingly well. 1070 already sold. I recorded Morgan’s opinion: then Vita was a little doubtful; then Desmond, whom I see frequently about his book, dashed all my praise by saying that Logan thought the C.R. well enough, but nothing more. Desmond has an abnormal power for depressing one. He takes the edge off life in some extraordinary way; I love him; but his balance & goodness & humour, all heavenly in themselves, somehow diminish lustre. I think I feel this not only about my work, but about life. However, now comes Mrs Hardy to say that Thomas reads, & hears the C.R. read, with “great pleasure”. Indeed, save for Logan, & he’s a salt veined American, I have had high praise. Also Tauchnitz asks about them.

We are now considering a change to a widow called by courtesy Smith, Jones’ sister; which will despatch poor Murphy, but one can’t be very sentimental over her, & to settle in with a placid powerful professional woman is precisely what we want to pull us together. Angus is a little languid—not that we in any way, I hasten to say, complain of him; but Murphy is temperamental, untidy, sloppy, & turns crusty about accounts.

A week ago we had a great invasion—Ottoline surprising us with Julian Philip & a Gathorne Hardy. Ottoline was very affectionate, & perhaps affection being so much time & habit, I too have some real affection for her. But how can I analyse my feelings? I like everyone, I said at 46 the other night; & Duncan said I liked everyone, & thought everyone quite new each time. That was at dinner to meet Miss Warner, the new Chatto & Windus poetess, & indeed she has some merit—enough to make me spend 2/6 on her, I think. It is a sunny fitful day, & standing in Hyde Park to listen to the socialists, that furtive Jew, Loeb, who dogs my life at intervals of 10 years, touched us on the shoulder, & took 2 photographs of us, measuring his distance with a black tape, provided by his wife. He usually tells people to hold one end next their hearts: but this is a joke. He had been hanging about Covent Garden to photograph singers & had lunched at 2.30. I asked if he were a professional, which hurt his pride: he owned to taking a great interest in it, & said he had a large collection.

Tom came in yesterday, rather rockier than last time, not quite so flushed with emotion, & inclined to particularise the state of Vivien’s bowels too closely for my taste. We both almost laughed; she has a queer rib, a large liver, & so on. What is more to the point is that Tom is to be the editor of a new mag quarterly, which some old firm is issuing in the autumn, & all his works must go to them—a blow for us.

He said nothing of my books. With great dignity, I did not ask for his opinion. People often dont read books for weeks & weeks. And anyhow, for my part I hate giving an opinion."
1925.06.05,"To work off the intense depression left by Desmond. What does this come from? But I have just made this beautiful image—how he is like a wave that never breaks, but lollops one this way & that way & the sail hangs on ones mast & the sun beats down—& its all the result of dining & sitting talking till 3 in the morning with El⁠[izabe]⁠th Bibesco, with whom I had tea yesterday. She is a fat housekeeper of a woman, excellent manager, bustling, economical, entirely without nerves, imagination, or sensibility, but what a good housekeeper, how she keeps the books down, & what a good woman of business, how well she would suit an innkeeper, & how she would see to his interests—entertain his customers with her; sprightly rather broad jokes, standing with her thumbs in arms akimbo her armpits on the other side of the bar, with all her false diamonds flashing, & her little pig eyes, & her broad fat hips & cheeks. This is the spiritual truth about Bibesco: the fact being that she lies in bed, in green crepe de chine, with real diamonds on her fingers, & a silk quilt, & thinks she talks brilliantly to the most intellectual set in London—so she does, to Desmond, & Mortimer, & poor Philip Ritchie, & I was half in a rage, having sacrificed my Mozart 5tet to her, from which I should have got gallons of pure pleasure instead of the breakfast cup of rather impure delight. For it had its fun. There was old Asquith in [page ends].

And then I was ruffled by Nelly, but got over it, by spending £50 of charm. And now I remember—how fatal this is to remember after a quarrel what one did not say—how I might have said, If you have Lottie every day, why should I not have my friends? But one can’t—& she is jealous, that is the truth. And next time I will say it—& it was Miss Mayor coming that upset us; ‘always people when we have dinner parties”. And we had Vita, Edith Sitwell, Morgan, Dadie, Kitty Leaf—old Vita presenting me with a whole tree of blue Lupins, & being very uncouth & clumsy, while Edith was like a Roman Empress, so definite clear cut, magisterial & yet with something of the humour of a fishwife—a little too commanding about her own poetry & ready to dictate—tremulously pleased by Morgan’s compliments (& he never praised Vita, who sat hurt, modest, silent, like a snubbed schoolboy)."
1925.06.08,"This is the hottest June on record. Do not take this seriously—only it is very hot. & we were at Karin’s yesterday. There was Irene & her Phil [Noel-Baker]. I am too sleepy having got up at ¼ to 6 this morning to describe her. She has spread a little, has a double chin, an emphatic nose, & the feet of gulls on sand round her eyes, which are of the old staring sea green blue. And she has her old ways—her straightforwardness, downrightness, ideals; love of adventure, but none of this is so becoming as of old. For in fact she’s grown stereotyped, metallic, harsh; her voice brazen, & her cheeks crude. She suspected me, & suspected Bloomsbury, & adored Leonard, whom she thought so salutary for Phil, but we both suspect [a] scheme for making Phil the foreign sec. in the next Labour Government. I liked her best when she talked about the Greek peasants, & that side may retain some charm. But she talks, talks, talks; thrusts her way with a hard kind of energy into whatever may be going forward—would like, I imagine, to wire pull, & be hostess, & know the right people, but instead protests a horror of success, & wants to keep Phil unspoilt. She also wants to be the mistress of men, I imagine, & a little resents that age should have unseated her from that familiar post, as it very obviously has. She veered, as usual, towards Desmond, professed her horror of “hurting Molly—a very gallant creature”, & almost drove L. distracted by asking him what he thought of the character of every politician.

No, she has not worn well; the plating has come off & she’s rather steely & common underneath. Needless to say, I had some waves of ancient emotion, chiefly at the sound of her voice & sight of her hands—hands expressing motherhood, perhaps; but mostly felt very flat, unable to pump up anything, & thus uncomfortable. To this, the sordid East End country, the woman who whispers with a gashed throat, the terrific pound home along the hot road, added. And the taxi never came, & we had a second night of it, hearing good, pure hearted Phil, with his principles & his ability, & his athleticism, read aloud to Irene till late."
1925.06.14,"A disgraceful confession—this is Sunday morning, & just after ten, & here I am sitting down to write diary & not fiction or reviews, without any excuse, except the state of my mind. After finishing those two books, though, one can’t concentrate directly on a new one; & then the letters, the talk, the reviews, all serve to enlarge the pupil of my mind more & more. I cant settle in, contract, & shut myself off. I’ve written 6 little stories, scrambled them down untidily, & have thought out, perhaps too clearly, To the Lighthouse. And both books so far are successful. More of Dalloway has been sold this month than of Jacob in a year. I think it possible we may sell 2,000. The Common one is making money this week. And I get treated at great length & solemnity by old gentlemen.

A powerful, heavy, light blue eyed woman of 50, Mrs Cartwright wants to succeed Murphy; & Murphy wants to stay. How people want work! How tremendous a pull a very little money has in the world! But what the solution is to be, & how we are to find it, I know not. Here I salute Leonard with unstinted, indeed childlike, adoration. Somehow he will gently & firmly decide the whole thing, while Angus & I wobble & prevaricate. But then I have a child’s trust in Leonard. Waking this morning, rather depressed that Mrs D. did not sell yesterday, that we had Peter [Lucas], Eileen Power & Noll & Ray [Strachey] last night & found it hard work, & not a single compliment vouchsafed me, that I had bought a glass necklace for £1, that I had a sore throat & a streaming nose, rather under the weather, I say, I snuggled in to the core of my life, which is this complete comfort with L., & there found everything so satisfactory & calm that I revived myself, & got a fresh start; feeling entirely immune. The immense success of our life, is I think, that our treasure is hid away; or rather in such common things that nothing can touch it. That is, if one enjoys a bus ride to Richmond, sitting on the green smoking, taking the letters out of the box, airing the marmots, combing Grizzle, making an ice, opening a letter, sitting down after dinner, side by side, & saying “Are you in your stall, brother?”—well, what can trouble this happiness? And every day is necessarily full of it. If we depended upon making speeches, or money, or getting asked to parties—which reminds me of Ottoline’s ghastly party the other night. What possessed me to talk all the time to Helen Anrep? Partly that the plethora of young men slightly annoys me. Really, I am not a good lioness. With all my vanity, I’m come now to be a little cynical, or why don’t I so much relish the admiration of the Turners, Kitchins, & Gathorne Hardys? A woman is much more warmly sympathetic. She carries her atmosphere with her. And Ott.’s powers of hostesry are all worn threadbare. People sat about at great distances, & one had a sense of the clock ticking & Ott. saying This is a failure, a failure, & not knowing how to pick the pieces up.

Now I must answer Gerald Brenan, & read the Genji; for tomorrow I make a second £20 from Vogue. Did I say that I am rejected by Sybil? From being Sybil, she has become Lady Colefax. No invitations for a month."
1925.06.16,"This is the fag end of my morning’s work on Genji, which runs a little too easily from my pen & must be compressed & compacted. Dalloway, I fear, has hit her head against some impassable barrier of the public, just as Jacob did, & scarcely sells these last 3 days. Yet my friends are enthusiastic—really so, I think; & ready to acclaim me successful, arrived, triumphant with this book: Clive, Mary, Molly, Roger, my latest allies. We have sold 1240, I think; so the wave spread further than Jacob, & has a ripple left perhaps.

Tonight is Leonard’s festival night, the feast of the Brethren Apostles, & presumably some overflow of them here. “Why do human beings invent these ways of torturing themselves?” Them’s his words; for he has to preside & speak. Old Lytton, I am reminded, has fairly passed from our lives. No word about my books; no visits since Easter. I imagine that when he takes a new love, & he has Angus, he gets surly, like a stag; he feels a little ridiculous, uneasy, & does not relish the company of old cynical friends like ourselves. And in fact, when I hear the story from Angus, of his agony & entreaty & despair, I only feel slightly nauseated. He makes the young men pity him & laugh at him, & there is a touch of senility in this exposure of himself, while, practically speaking, his amours land him in society of the most tepid, milk & watery kind; nothing that taxes his mind or stimulates; poor feeble Philip for instance, who is precisely like an Eton boy in an Eton jacket: give him an ice & a sovereign.

“Them’s his words”—this reminds me I must get back to D. Copperfield. There are moments when all the masterpieces do no more than strum upon broken strings. It is very rare—the right mood for reading—in its way as intense a delight as any; but for the most part pain."
1925.06.18,"No, Lytton does not like Mrs Dalloway, &, what is odd, I like him all the better for saying so, & don’t much mind. What he says is that there is a discordancy between the ornament (extremely beautiful) & what happens (rather ordinary—or unimportant). This is caused he thinks by some discrepancy in Clarissa herself; he thinks she is disagreeable & limited, but that I alternately laugh at her, & cover her, very remarkably, with myself. So that I think as a whole, the book does not ring solid; yet, he says, it is a whole; & he says sometimes the writing is of extreme beauty. What can one call it but genius? he said! Coming when, one never can tell. Fuller of genius, he said than anything I had done. Perhaps, he said, you have not yet mastered your method. You should take something wilder & more fantastic, a frame work that admits of anything, like Tristram Shandy. But then I should lose touch with emotions, I said. Yes, he agreed, there must be reality for you to start from. Heaven knows how you’re to do it. But he thought me at the beginning, not at the end. And he said the C.R. was divine, a classic; Mrs D. being, I fear, a flawed stone. This is very personal, he said & old fashioned perhaps; yet I think there is some truth in it. For I remember the night at Rodmell when I decided to give it up, because I found Clarissa in some way tinselly. Then I invented her memories. But I think some distaste for her persisted. Yet, again, that was true to my feeling for Kitty, & one must dislike people in art without its mattering, unless indeed it is true that certain characters detract from the importance of what happens to them. None of this hurts me, or depresses me. Its odd that when Clive & others (several of them) say it is a masterpiece, I am not much exalted; when Lytton picks holes, I get back into my working fighting mood, which is natural to me. I July 20th Have sold about 1550 don’t see myself a success. I like the sense of effort better. The sales collapsed completely for 3 days; now a little dribble begins again. I shall be more than pleased if we sell 1500. Its now 1250."
1925.06.27,"A bitter cold day, succeeding a chilly windy night, in which were lit all the Chinese lanterns of Roger’s garden party. And I do not love my kind. I detest them. I pass them by. I let them break on me like dirty rain drops. No longer can I summon up that energy which when it sees one of these dry little sponges floating past, or rather stuck on the rock, sweeps round them, steeps them, infuses them, nerves them, & so finally fills them & creates them. Once I had a gift for doing this, & a passion, & it made parties arduous & exciting. So when I wake early now I luxuriate most in a whole day alone; a day of easy natural poses, a little printing, slipping tranquilly off into the deep water of my own thoughts navigating the underworld; & then replenishing my cistern at night with Swift. I am going to write about Stella & Swift for Richmond, as a sign of grace, after sweeping guineas off the Vogue counter. The first fruit of the C.R. (a book too highly praised now) is a request to write for the Atlantic Monthly. So I am getting pushed into criticism. It is a great stand by—this power to make large sums by formulating views on Stendhal & Swift.

Jack dined here last night; & we said how many years is it since we three were alone in a room together? he & Nessa & I, waiting for dinner, & a little nervous. I’m more nervous of these encounters than she is. She has a sweet cordiality (odd term to use) which impressed me, recalling mother, as she led him on; & laughed; so sincere, so quiet, & then, when we went on to Roger’s rather dismal gathering, gay & spirited, kissing Chrissie & flirting with Mrs Anrep, so careless & casual & white-haired—but enough of this. The truth is I am too random headed to describe Jack, yet he is worth describing. He made us laugh of course. He said such Wallerish things. “There are two kinds of biography, my dear Ginia”—in his old opinionative sententious way with enormous emphasis. He is red-copper coloured, with a pouch under his chin which rests on his collar; trusty brown eyes, a little hazy now, & one ear deaf, he said, & proceeded to tell us how he is cured by a Swiss every year, & gives the Nuns who keep the clinic a box of chocolates, which they love, being underfed. He looks in at the window & sees them handing the box round, & picking in turn. Then he told us, driving back from Roger’s—I insist upon paying this taxi my dear Leonard—how he sugared for moths last summer & caught perhaps 150—& the man he was with (on a fishing club) left his electric light on & the moths came & sat on the curtain. He exaggerates, illuminates, appreciates everyone very generously. L. thinks he “might become a bit of a bore”. Then we discussed his writing an autobiography: upon which he became very intent, & almost emotional. “But could one tell the truth? About one’s affairs with women? About one’s parents? My mother now—she was a very able woman—we all owe her an awful lot—but hard.” She said an odd thing to Nessa once—that she hated girls, especially motherless girls. “There you go very deep—It was the terror of her life—that she was losing her charm. She would never have a girl in the house. It was a tragedy. She was a very selfish woman.” (But while I try to write, I am making up “To the Lighthouse”—the sea is to be heard all through it. I have an idea that I will invent a new name for my books to supplant “novel”. A new —— by Virginia Woolf. But what? Elegy?)"
1925.07.19,"By bringing this book down here to the Studio, I have rather stinted it I think, as my mornings have all been spent writing—Swift or letters. So a whole tribe of people & parties has gone down the sink to oblivion—Ott’s parties & complaints; Gwen Raverat set sturdy dusty grim black, yesterday; Tom hedging a little over the Bank; Sybil Colefax drinking tea & protesting her desire to give up parties; her party when Olga Lynn dropped her music in a rage & had to be pacified by Balfour; & Ott lost her shawl; & the garden was lit like a stage, & Clive & Mary could be seen to the least eyelash; & so home to bed; & Mrs Asquith, Lady Oxford, called me the most beautiful woman in the room, which compliment was repeated to me the next night (so thick have parties been) by Jack Hutch, at Dadie’s, where there were many faces again, & drink, & again home to bed; & then little Eddie Sackville-West & Julian Morrell to dine (& I am to have his piano) & Philip in to fetch her; & then a party at Ott’s with Ching playing the piano; & the news of Hew Anderson’s death there broken to Angus; & Murphy going; & Mrs Cartwright coming; & my books—oh yes, the Calendar has abused Mrs D. which hurt me a little; & then the tide of praise has flowed over me again, & they both sell well, & my fears were ungrounded; & Maynard has brought us a pamphlet, wh. is called The Economic Consequences of Mr Churchill, & we are having 10,000 printed for Monday week to sell at a shilling.

On Friday I went on a river party & we dined at Formosa, & Eddie [Sackville-West] played in the round drawing room, & there was George Young in a punt. Not a moments reflection has gone to any of these statements; but I take them together, never knowing what withered straw doesn’t vivify the whole bunch of flowers. They have shone bright & gay this summer in the incessant heat. For the first time for weeks I sit by a fire, but then I am in the thinnest silk dress; & for once, it is watery & windy though I see blue sky through my skylight. A happy summer, very busy; rather overpowered by the need of seeing so many people. I never ask a soul here; but they accumulate. Tonight Ottoline, Tuesday Jack Hutch; Wednesday Edith Sitwell, Friday dine with Raymond. These are my fixed invitations; & all sorts of unforseen ones will occur. I run out after tea as if pursued. I mean to regulate this better in future. But I dont think of the future, or the past, I feast on the moment. This is the secret of happiness; but only reached now in middle age."
1925.07.20,"Here the door opened, & Morgan came in to ask us out to lunch with him at the Etoile, which we did, though we had a nice veal & ham pie at home (this is in the classic style of journalists). It comes of Swift perhaps, the last words of which I have just written, & so fill up time here.

I should consider my work list now. I think a little story, perhaps a review, this fortnight; having a superstitious wish to begin To the Lighthouse the first day at Monks House. I now think I shall finish it in the two months there. The word ‘sentimental’ sticks in my gizzard (I’ll write it out of me in a story—Ann Watkins of New York is coming on Wednesday to enquire about my stories). But this theme may be sentimental; father & mother & child in the garden: the death; the sail to the lighthouse. I think, though, that when I begin it I shall enrich it in all sorts of ways; thicken it; give it branches & roots which I do not perceive now. It might contain all characters boiled down; & childhood; & then this impersonal thing, which I’m dared to do by my friends, the flight of time, & the consequent break of unity in my design. That passage (I conceive the book in 3 parts: 1. at the drawing room window; 2. seven years passed; 3. the voyage:) interests me very much. A new problem like that breaks fresh ground in ones mind; prevents the regular ruts.

Last night Clive dined with us; & Nelly is rather waspish about it this morning; & tried to run away before Ottoline came; but it proved to be Adrian; & then we talked of cancer, & Clive got set, & Ottoline came, in tea kettle taffeta, all looped & scolloped & fringed with silver lace, & talked about Rupert & Jacques, & re-told, with emendations, the story of Ka & Henry Lamb & herself. She has been working over these old stories so often, that they hold no likeness to the truth—they are stale, managed, pulled this way & that, as we used to knead & pull the crumb of bread, till it was a damp slab. Then the old motor was heard hooting & there was Philip & Julian [Morrell], at which, at Julian that is, Clive cheered up, & was very brisk & obliging as he knows how. We argued the case of the aristocracy v. the middle class. I rather liked it. But one seldom says anything very profound. I like the sense of other people liking it, as I suppose the Morrells do, for they settle on us like a cloud of crows, once a week now. My vanity as a hostess is flattered. Sometimes a buttery crumb of praise is thrown to me—“Lady Desborough admires your books enormously—wants to meet you”—& then Clive, looking at my photographs in Vogue says of the one last year—“That is charming—but must be taken very long ago, I suppose”—so you see how I switch back from pleasure to pain, & time was when I should have ended the evening fast stuck in black despair, gone to bed like a diver with pursed lips shooting into oblivion. But enough, enough—I coin this little catchword to control my tendency to flower into phrase after phrase. Some are good though.

What shall I read at Rodmell? I have so many books at the back of my mind. I want to read voraciously & gather material for the Lives of the Obscure—which is to tell the whole history of England in one obscure life after another. Proust I should like to finish. Stendhal, & then to skirmish about hither & thither. These 8 weeks at Rodmell always seem capable of holding an infinite amount. Shall we buy the house at Southease? I suppose not."
1925.07.30,"I am intolerably sleepy & annulled, & so write here. I do want indeed to consider my next book, but I am inclined to wait for a clearer head. The thing is I vacillate between a single & intense character of father; & a far wider slower book—Bob T. telling me that my speed is terrific, & destructive. My summer’s wanderings with the pen have I think shown me one or two new dodges for catching my flies. I have sat here, like an improviser with his hands rambling over the piano. The result is perfectly inconclusive, & almost illiterate. I want to learn greater quiet, & force. But if I set myself that task, don’t I run the risk of falling into the flatness of N⁠[ight]. & D⁠[ay].? Have I got the power needed if quiet is not to become insipid. These questions I will leave, for the moment, unanswered.

I should here try to sum up the summer, since August ends a season, spiritual as well as temporal. Well; business has been brisk. I don’t think I get many idle hours now, the idlest being, oddly enough, in the morning. I have not forced my brain at its fences; but shall, at Rodmell. When the dull sleep of afternoon is on me, I’m always in the shop, printing, dissing addressing; then it is tea, & Heaven knows we have had enough visitors. Sometimes I sit still & wonder how many people will tumble on me without my lifting a finger: already, this week, uninvited, on the verge of the holidays too, have come Mary, Gwen, Julian & Quentin, Geoffrey Keynes, & Roger. Meanwhile we are dealing with Maynard. All Monday Murphy & I worked like slaves till 6 when I was stiff as a coal heaver. We get telegrams & telephones; I daresay we shall sell our 10,000. On Tuesday at 12.30 Maynard retires to St Paneras Registry office with Lydia, & Duncan to witness (against his will.) So that episode is over. But, dear me, I’m too dull to write, & must go & fetch Mr Dobrée’s novel & read it, I think. Yet I have a thousand things to say. I think I might do something in To the Lighthouse, to split up emotions more completely. I think I’m working in that direction."
1925.09.05,"And why couldn’t I see or feel that all this time I was getting a little used up & riding on a flat tire? So I was, as it happened; & fell down in a faint at Charleston, in the middle of Q.’s birthday party: & then have lain about here, in that odd amphibious life of headache, for a fortnight. This has rammed a big hole in my 8 weeks which were to be stuffed so full. Never mind. Arrange whatever pieces come your way. Never be unseated by the shying of that undependable brute, life, hag ridden as she is by my own queer, difficult nervous system. Even at 43 I dont know its workings, for I was saying to myself, all the summer, “I’m quite adamant now. I can go through a tussle of emotions peaceably that two years ago even, would have raked me raw.”

I have made a very quick & flourishing attack on To the Lighthouse, all the same—22 pages straight off in less than a fortnight. I am still crawling & easily enfeebled, but if I could once get up steam again, I believe I could spin it off with infinite relish. Think what a labour the first pages of Dalloway were! Each word distilled by a relentless clutch on my brain.

I took up the pen meaning to write on “Disillusionment”. I have never had any illusion so completely burnt out of me as my illusion about the Richmonds. This they effected between 4 & 6 yesterday. But Elena has no beauty, no charm, no very marked niceness even! Any country parsons wife is her match. Her nose is red, her cheeks blowsed: her eyes without character. Even her voice & movements which used to be adorable, her distinction, her kindly charm—all have vanished; she is a thick, dowdy, obliterated woman, who has no feelings, no sympathies, prominences & angles are all completely razed bare. Seriously, one as doubts for her complete mental equipment. The conversation was practically imbecile: for instance: (E). I think I could get very fond on a house. But we are so lucky. There are some delightful people near. People who like the same sort of things we do. (B). We are very lucky. There are two fellows within 4 miles who were at Winchester with me. One went to Ceylon as a tea planter. They both farm now. Are you lucky in your clergyman? So much depends in the country on one’s clergyman. (E). I really forget anything more from the lips of E. I believe it was all the same: how she would like a house with a piano: & they mean to retire & buy a house with a piano. She sees flowers, dogs, houses, people with the same quiet, stolid, almost coarse, at any rate dull indifference. Her hands are thick. She has a double chin. She wears a long American looking blueish coat, with a nondescript dowdy scarf, a white blouse, fastened with a diamond lizard oh the colourlessness, drabness, & coldness of her personality—she whom I used to think arch & womanly & comforting! She is white haired too. Bruce is completely circular: round head, eyes, nose, paunch, mind. You can’t stop him rolling from thing to thing. He never stops, he glides smoothly. It would shock him to mention writing, money, or people. All has to be dissolved in slang & kindliness.

Now the curious thing was that these qualities infected us both to such an extent that we were acutely miserable. I have sometimes felt the same when walking in the suburbs. Castello Avenue made me angry like this once. As for L. he was indignant. That human nature should sink so low, he said; & then that people should lead such aimless evil lives—the most despicable he could imagine. They took the colour, the sting, the individuality out of everything. And to think that I have ever wasted a thought upon what that goodtempered worldly little grocer thought of my writing! But E. is the great disillusionment. Partly on Thoby’s account, partly through my own susceptibility to certain shades of female charm, I had still some glow at the thought of her. Now that glow is replaced by a solid tallow candle. And I feel, this morning, having pitched into bed exhausted, physically worn out, mentally bankrupt, scraped; whitewashed, cleaned. An illusion gone."
1925.09.14,"A disgraceful fact—I am writing this at 10 in the morning in bed in the little room looking into the garden, the sun beaming steady, the vine leaves transparent green, & the leaves of the apple tree so brilliant that, as I had my breakfast, I invented a little story about a man who wrote a poem, I think, comparing them with diamonds, & the spiders webs (which glance & disappear astonishingly) with something or other else: which led me to think of Marvell on a country life, so to Herrick, & the reflection that much of it was dependent upon the town & gaiety—a reaction. However, I have forgotten the facts. I am writing this partly to test my poor bunch of nerves at the back of my neck—will they hold or give again, as they have done so often?—for I’m amphibious still, in bed & out of it; partly to glut my itch (‘glut’ and ‘itch’!) for writing. It is the great solace, & scourge. Leonard is in London this solitary perfect day; this day of the peculiar September mintage; talking to Murphy in the basement, while the vans rumble by, & peoples skirts & trousers appear at the top of the area. This leads us to think of selling Monks, & spending our summers, quit of Press, quit of Nelly, quit of Nation, quit of polar blasts, in the South of France. The news that Mr Wilkinson is longing to buy Monks shakes our resolution to sell it. A walk, in pearly mottled weather, on the marshes, plunges me in love again. Leonard then finds his potato crop good, & his autumn crocuses rising. We have been in the throes of the usual servant crisis—varied this time it is true: Nelly says Lottie wants to come back; we offer to have her; she denies it—to Karin; to Nelly she prevaricates. I was flung into a passion with Karin, & so precipitated another headache. But we are on the laps of the Gods: we don’t intend to raise a finger either way. Only it is a curious reflection that a little strain with servants more effectually screws the nerves at the back of the head than any other I am aware of. Now why? It is because it is subterranean, partly.

Tom has treated us scurvily, much in the manner that he has treated the Hutchinsons. On Monday I get a letter that fawns & flatters, implores me to write for his new 4ly; & proposes to discuss press matters as soon as we get back; on Thursday we read in the Lit. Supt. that his new firm is publishing Waste Land also (Sept 23rd) that Read is being asked to write for Tom’s Press & his other poems—a fact which he dared not confess, but sought to palliate by flattering me. He treated Jack in the same way over Vivien’s story in the Criterion. The Underworld—the dodges & desires of the Underworld, its shifts & cabals are at the bottom of it. He intends to get on by the methods of that world; & my world is really not the underworld. However, there is a kind of fun in unravelling the twists & obliquities of this remarkable man. How far will they make his poetry squint? Anyhow, at my age, without illusions of that sort any more—I mean in the greatness of Tom, or the greatness of any of us, or our power to influence each other intellectually—I remain detached, & composed. Plenty of other illusions remain to me—emotional, personal; the pleasures of inventing Wednesday walks this winter is now uppermost. I’m going to Greenwich, to Caen Woods, to Gunnersbury, all in the dripping autumn weather, with tea at an A.B.C. & home to a hot bath. Really I am going to let myself slacken in social ways: instead of feeling that I shirk a hedge, in refusing Lord Berners or Lady Colefax, I am going to allow myself to do so approvingly; saying that I strengthen a paragraph in The Lighthouse thereby, or add another hour to the shabby crony talk which I love best. Not but what I shall dip here & there; but without anxiety or preparation of clothes or any of that struggle. This gives me a delicious sense of ease. And I have earned it, too, for I spread my £35 dress allowance to its furthest, & braved many a party spartanly ‘on principle’ as the marmots would say. The ‘principle’ which I find intermittently guiding my life is—to take one’s fences. Heaven knows how I’ve dreaded them! Now, with my Studio habitable, & another servant perhaps, I shall aim at haphazard, bohemian meetings, music (we have the algraphone, & thats a heavenly prospect—music after dinner while I stitch at my woolwork—I go to Lewes this afternoon to meet Nessa & buy wools) people of our own standard dropping in; ease, slippers, smoke, buns, chocolate. For I’m naturally sociable; it cannot be denied."
1925.09.22,"How my handwriting goes down hill! Another sacrifice to the Hogarth Press. Yet what I owe the Hogarth Press is barely paid by the whole of my handwriting. Haven’t I just written to Herbert Fisher refusing to do a book for the Home University Series on Post Victorian?—knowing that I can write a book, a better book, a book off my own bat, for the Press if I wish! To think of being battened down in the hold of those University dons fairly makes my blood run cold. Yet I’m the only woman in England free to write what I like. The others must be thinking of series’ & editors. Yesterday I heard from Harcourt Brace that Mrs D. & C.R. are selling 148 & 73 weekly—Isn’t that a surprising rate for the 4th month? Doesn’t it portend a bathroom & a w.c. either here, or Southease? I am writing in the watery blue sunset, repentance of an ill tempered morose day, which vanished, the clouds, I have no doubt, showing gold over the downs, & leaving a soft gold fringe on the top there.

Today is"
1925.09.24,"—sad to think a week only left whole of this partially wrecked summer; however, I don’t complain, seeing as how I have dipped my head in health again & feel stabilised once more about the spinal cord, which is always the centre of my being. Maynard & Lydia came here yesterday—M. in Tolstoi’s blouse & Russian cap of black astrachan—A fair sight, both of them, to meet on the high road! An immense good will & vigour pervades him. She hums in his wake, the great mans wife. But though one could carp, one can also find them very good company, & my heart, in this the autumn of my age, slightly warms to him, whom I’ve known all these years, so truculently pugnaciously, & unintimately. We had very brisk talk of Russia: such a hotch-potch, such a mad jumble, M. says, of good & bad, & the most extreme things that he can make no composition of it—can’t yet see how it goes. Briefly, spies everywhere, no liberty of speech, greed for money eradicated, people living in common, yet some, L⁠[ydia]’s mother for instance with servants, peasants contented because they own land, no sign of revolution, artistocrats acting showmen to their possessions, ballet respected, best show of Cezanne & Matisse in existence. Endless processions of communists in top hats, prices exorbitant, yet champagne produced, & the finest cooking in Europe, banquets beginning at 8.30 & going on till 2.30; people getting slightly drunk, say about 11, & wandering round the table. Kalinin getting up, & perambulating followed by a little crowd who clapped him steadily as he walked; then the immense luxury of the old Imperial trains; feeding off the Tsars plate; interview with Zinoviev who (I think) was a suave cosmopolital Jew, but had two fanatical watch dogs with square faces, guarding him, & mumbling out their mysteries, fanatically. One prediction of theirs, to the effect that in 10 years time the standard of living will be higher in Russia than it was before the war, but in all other countries lower, M. thought might very well come true. Anyhow they are crammed & packed with sights & talks: Maynard has a medal set in diamonds, & L. a gold sovereign wh. she was allowed to take from the bags at the mint.

But the Keynes’, I need hardly say, renewed my headache, & when Lytton came, I was drooping over the fire, & could not do much battle with that old serpent. What was said I think was to the effect that he had had a fire at Hamspray, which blistered the wall, but did not touch his books—& what fire could have the heart to do that? Then he had read Bunny “Really its very extraordinary—so arty,—so composed—the competence terrific, but … well, its like a perfectly restored Inn—Ye Olde … everything tidied up & restored.” No Bunny in it, as there were signs of being in The Man in the Zoo; no humour; a perfect restoration.

But to tell the truth, I am exacerbated this morning. It is 10.25, on a fine grey still day; Lily is doing my bedroom; the starlings are in the apple tree; Leonard is in London, & Nelly I suppose is settling the greatest question of her whole life—what marriage is to a woman—with Lottie. Lily is a wide eyed sheep dog girl who comes from Iford to ‘do’; but can’t scramble an egg or bake a potato, & is thus ill armed for life, so far as I can see.

Beginning at 9.45 I wrote two pages of a story, as a test again; & passed it well, I think, anyhow my cistern is full of ideas. But to the point: why am I exacerbated? By Roger. I told him I had been ill all the summer. His reply is—silence as to that; but plentiful descriptions of his own front teeth. Egotism, egotism—it is the essential ingredient in a clever man’s life I believe. It protects; it enhances; it preserves his own vital juices entire by keeping them banked in. Also I cannot help thinking that he suspects me of valetudinarianism & this enrages me: & L. is away & I cant have my thorn picked out by him, so must write it out. There! it is better now; & I think I hear the papers come; & will get them, my woolwork, & a glass of milk."
1925.09.30,"This was I suppose successfully accomplished; & it is now Wednesday morning, damp & close & over all the sense already of transmigration, of shedding one habit for another. My autumn coat is grown. I begin to sympathise with Nelly’s longing for the ease & speed of civilisation. But I vow here not to be misled into thinking this is life—this perpetual frenzy & stretch; or I shall again be deposited in a heap, as I was in August.

Today we are on Tom’s track, riddling & reviling him. He won’t let Read off that book, has been after him 3 or 4 months. Dignity is our line; & really, as far as the poaching of authors goes, he won’t harm us. Then there is the fascination of a breach; I mean, after feeling all this time conscious of something queer about him, it is more satisfactory to have it on the surface. Not that I want a breach: what I want is a revelation. But L. thinks the queer shifty creature will slip away now.

I actually forgot to record the finish of the Lottie drama—she’s in love with the cowman at Thorpe [-le-Soken]! This emerged after an hours violent argument with Nelly. This explains & excuses all: & we are, for private reasons, thoroughly content. What is worse, is poor unfortunate Karin—in operating, they cut a nerve in her face, which is half paralysed. She can’t speak, I gather, without being all screwed up. She refuses to see the children for fear of frightening them. This final malignancy on the part of fate seems to me her knock out blow; save that somehow she will, I suppose, find a way round, as people mostly do. This softens the heart towards her. It makes one think of her courage. But how quickly the intense feeling of sympathy passes, & she resumes her place in ones mind as a person one is conscious of being permanently, dully, sorry for. But then propinquity will revive it: Tavistock Sqre, being next door, will make one more conscious of the horror of screwing up one’s own face."
1925.11.27,"Oh what a blank! I tumbled into bed on coming back—or rather Ellie tumbled me; & keeps me still prostrate half the day. Next week I shall go to the ballet, my first night out. One visitor a day. Till 2 days ago, bed at 5. So visitors have become as usual, pictures hung on the wall. On the whole, I have not been unhappy; but not very happy; too much discomfort; sickness, (cured by eating instantly); a good deal of rat-gnawing at the back of my head; one or two terrors; then the tiredness of the body—it lay like a workman’s coat. Sometimes I felt old, & spent. Madge died. Rustling among my emotions, I found nothing better than dead leaves. Her letters had eaten away the reality—the brilliancy, the warmth. Oh detestable time, that thus eats out the heart & lets the body go on. They buried a faggot of twigs at Highgate, as far as I am concerned. I drove to the gate, & saw Nessa & Leonard, like a pair of stuffed figures, go in.

My walks are extended to Oxford Street; only once so far; & then what about talks. Vita has been twice. She is doomed to go to Persia; & I minded the thought so much (thinking to lose sight of her for 5 years) that I conclude I am genuinely fond of her. There is the glamour of unfamiliarity to reckon with; of aristocracy (Raymond says, But she’s half a peasant—) of flattery. All the same, after sifting & filing, much, I am sure, remains. Shall I stay with her? Shall we go to Charleston for Christmas? The best of these illnesses is that they loosen the earth about the roots. They make changes. People express their affection. Nessa wants to have us—Indeed, I have seen more of her & Duncan than for many a day. Gwen [Raverat] comes in: threatens to dissolve, her hearty direct stodgy manner in floods of tears, as if the rivets that hold her must give way—such tragedies have beaten her, together for the moment; but suddenly she will break down & tell me something that she has not told anyone. She finds me understanding. And I suppose she is in love—or Marchand in love—& I don’t altogether want to hear it.

Reading & writing go on. Not my novel though. And I can only think of all my faults as a novelist & wonder why I do it—a wonder which Lytton increases, & Morgan decreases. Morgan is writing an article on me. This may be very helpful. It may shove me off again. Then I want to write ‘a book’ by which I mean a book of criticism for the H.P. But on what? Letters? Psychology? Lytton is off: The Loves of the Famous. Q. Elizabeth &c. I thought him at his most intimate last night; all plumy, incandescent, soft, luminous. Something slightly repels (too strong) Leonard. His character is not so good as Morgan’s, he said, walking round the square in the snow today. “There is something about all Stracheys—” Then, when we talk, L. & I, we rather crab Lytton’s writing I observe. But all this vanishes, with me, when he comes, as yesterday, to talk, & talk, & talk. That Nessa is still most beautiful—that comes over me. That Ka is thinner—& very self conscious: but nothing, in my sentimental heart, can stand against these old loyalties. I cannot keep my wits altogether about me in talk. I begin to glitter & englobe people with a champagne mist. And then it fades. I was talking of this to Raymond—whose blunt nose & flashy clothes are, I think, one’s chief grudge against him—the other day. That there is no substance in ones friendships, that they fade like—For instance, did he regret Harold [Nicolson] in Persia?* * A shrewd guess—he does regret Harold in Persia Nothing … like a coin is struck & left for ever in one’s possession. People die; Madge dies, & one cannot beat up a solitary tear. But then, if 6 people died, it is true that my life would cease: by wh. I mean, it would run so thin that though it might go on, would it have any relish? Imagine Leonard, Nessa Duncan Lytton, Clive Morgan all dead."
1925.12.07,"I want to lie down like a tired child & weep away this life of care—& my diary shall receive me on its downy pillow. Most children do not know what they cry for; nor do I altogether. It is 12 o’clock on Monday morning, a very cold day, but sunny, healthy, cheerful. Bells ring downstairs; doors are slammed. I should be in full feather, for after all these drowsy dependent weeks I am now almost quit of it again; & can read & write, & walk a little, & mildly entertain. Well, it is partly that devil Vita. No letter. No visit. No invitation to Long Poor woman! she did try to come—prevented, fog &c. Barn. She was up last week, & never came. So many good reasons for this neglect occur to me that I’m ashamed to call this a cause for weeping. Only if I do not see her now, I shall not—ever: for the moment for intimacy will be gone, next summer. And I resent this, partly because I like her; partly because I hate the power of life to divide. Also, I am vain. Clive will know why Vita did not come to see me. That old rat chased to his hole, there is Tom’s postcard about On Being III—an article which I, & Leonard too, thought one of my best: to him characteristic &c: I mean he is not enthusiastic; so, reading the proof just now, I saw wordiness, feebleness, & all the vices in it. This increases my distaste for my own writing, & dejection at the thought of beginning another novel. What theme have I? Shan’t I be held up for personal reasons? It will be too like father, or mother: &, oddly, I know so little of my own powers. Here is another rat run to earth. So now for news.

We shall spend Xmas at Charleston, which I’m afraid Leonard will not like much. We walked at Hampstead on Saturday. It was very cold—skating everywhere, save there, L. having brought his skates. It had a foggy winter beauty. We went in to Ken Wood (but dogs must be led) & there came to the duelling ground, where great trees stand about, & presumably sheltered the 18th Century swordsmen (how I begin to love the past—I think something to do with my book) & it was here that we discussed Lytton, gravely, like married people. But my God—how satisfactory after, I think 12 years, to have any human being to whom one can speak so directly as I to L.! Well, it was a question of L⁠[ytton]’s change of feeling. He has the faults of a small nature said L. He is ungenerous. He asks, but never gives. But I have always known that—often I have seen the dull eyelid fall over him, if one asked a little too much: some sheath of selfishness that protects him from caring too much, or committing himself uncomfortably. He is cautious. He is a valetudinarian. But—there are, as usual, the other things; & as I say, I have known about Lytton’s leathern eyelid since I was 20. Nothing has ever shocked me more, I think. But L. said when they were at Cambridge Lytton was not like that to him. First there was the I⁠[nternationa]⁠l Review: & Lytton refused to write; then Ralph; then never a word of praise for other people. Morgan, said Leonard, as we trod back over the slippery hillocks seeing so little as we talked (& yet all this part of Hampstead recalls Katherine to me—that faint ghost, with the steady eyes, the mocking lips, &, at the end, the wreath set on her hair:) Morgan has improved. Morgan is I think naturally more congenial to L. than Lytton is. He likes “Sillies”; he likes the dependent simplicity of Morgan & myself. He likes settling our minds, & our immense relief at this. Well, well.

I am reading The Passage to India; but will not expatiate here, as I must elsewhere. This book for the H.P.: I think I will find some theory about fiction. I shall read six novels, & start some hares. The one I have in view, is about perspective. But I do not know. My brain may not last me out. I cannot think closely enough. But I can—if the C.R. is a test—beat up ideas, & express them now without too much confusion. (By the way, Robert Bridges likes Mrs Dalloway: says no one will read it; but it is beautifully written, & some more, which L. who was told by Morgan, cannot remember.)

I don’t think it is a matter of ‘development’ but something to do with prose & poetry, in novels. For instance Defoe at one end: E. Brontë at the other. Reality something they put at different distances. One would have to go into conventions; real life; & so on. It might last me—this theory—but I should have to support it with other things. And death—as I always feel—hurrying near. 43: how many more books?

Katie came here; a sort of framework of discarded beauty hung on a battered shape now. With the firmness of the flesh, & the blue of the eye, the formidable manner has gone. I can see her as she was at 22 H⁠[yde] P⁠[ark] G⁠[ate] 25 years ago: in a little coat & skirt; very splendid; eyes half shut; lovely mocking voice; upright; tremendous; shy. Now she babbles along.

“But no duke ever asked me, my dear Virginia. They called me the Ice Queen.

And why did I marry Cromer? I loathed Egypt; I loathed invalids. I’ve had two very happy times in my life—childhood—not when I grew up—but later, with my boys club, my cottage, & my chow—& now. Now I have all I want. My garden—my dog.”

I don’t think her son enters in very largely. She is one of these cold eccentric great Englishwomen, enormously enjoying her rank, & the eminence it lends her in St John’s Wood, & now free to poke into all the dusty holes & corners, dressed like a charwoman, with hands like one, & finger nails clotted with dirt. She never stops talking. She lacks much body to her. She has almost effused in mist. But I enjoyed it. Though I think she has few affections, & no very passionate interests. Now, having cried my cry, & the sun coming out, to write a list of Christmas presents. Ethel Sands comes to tea. But no Vita."
1925.12.21,"But no Vita! But Vita for 3 days at Long Barn, from which L. & I returned yesterday. These Sapphists love women; friendship is never untinged with amorosity. In short, my fears & refrainings, my ‘impertinence’ my usual self-consciousness in intercourse with people who mayn’t want me & so on—were all, as L. said, sheer fudge; &, partly thanks to him (he made me write) I wound up this wounded & stricken year in great style. I like her & being with her, & the splendour—she shines in the grocers shop in Sevenoaks with a candle lit radiance, stalking on legs like beech trees, pink glowing, grape clustered, pearl hung. That is the secret of her glamour, I suppose. Anyhow she found me incredibly dowdy, no woman cared less for personal appearance—no one put on things in the way I did. Yet so beautiful, &c. What is the effect of all this on me? Very mixed. There is her maturity & full breastedness: her being so much in full sail on the high tides, where I am coasting down backwaters; her capacity I mean to take the floor in any company, to represent her country, to visit Chatsworth, to control silver, servants, chow dogs; her motherhood (but she is a little cold & offhand with her boys) her being in short (what I have never been) a real woman. Then there is some voluptuousness about her; the grapes are ripe; & not reflective. No. In brain & insight she is not as highly organised as I am. But then she is aware of this, & so lavishes on me the maternal protection which, for some reason, is what I have always most wished from everyone. What L. gives me, & Nessa gives me, & Vita, in her more clumsy external way, tries to give me. For of course, mingled with all this glamour, grape clusters & pearl necklaces, there is something loose fitting. How much, for example, shall I really miss her when she is motoring across the desert? I will make a note on that next year. Anyhow, I am very glad that she is coming to tea today, & I shall ask her, whether she minds my dressing so badly? I think she does. I read her poem; which is more compact, better seen & felt than anything yet of hers.

Mary’s stories, I fear, are bad. Dear me—then Roger is in love with H⁠[elen Anrep]. Morgan’s article has cheered me very much. L. is doing up rubber seals & fur rabbits at the moment. The workmen are hammering, their engines throbbing outside on the hotel. We go down to Charleston tomorrow, not without some trepidation on my part, partly because I shall be hung about with trailing clouds of glory from Long Barn wh. always disorientates me & makes me more than usually nervous: then I am—altogether so queer in some ways. One emotion succeeds another."
1926.01.19,"Vita having this moment (20 minutes ago—it is now 7) left me, what are my feelings? Of a dim November fog; the lights dulled & damped. I walked towards the sound of a barrel organ in Marchmont Street. But this will disperse; then I shall want her, clearly & distinctly. Then not—& so on. This is the normal human feeling, I think. One wants to finish sentences. One wants that atmosphere—to me so rosy & calm. She is not clever; but abundant & fruitful; truthful too. She taps so many sources of life: repose & variety, was her own expression, sitting on the floor this evening in the gaslight. We dined last night at the Ivy with Clive; & then they had a supper party, from which I refrained. Oh & mixed up with this is the invigoration of again beginning my novel, in the Studio, for the first time this morning. All these fountains play on my being & intermingle. I feel a lack of stimulus, of marked days, now Vita is gone; & some pathos, common to all these partings; & she has 4 days journey through the snow.

1926"
1926.02.08,"Just back from Rodmell—to use again the stock opening. And I should explain why I’ve let a month slip perhaps. First, I think, the German measles or influenza; next Vita; then, disinclination for any exertion, so that I never made a book till last week. But undoubtedly this diary is established, & I sometimes look at it & wonder what on earth will be the fate of it. It is to serve the purpose of my memoirs. At 60 I am to sit down & write my life. As rough material for that masterpiece—& knowing the caprice of my own brain as record reader for I never know what will take my fancy, I here record that I come in to find the following letters waiting me. 1. Ottoline, on that wonderful essay On Being Ill. She is doing a cure. 2. A long letter of hysterical flattery from Miss Keiller [Kieffer] who is translating Jacob’s Room. 3. a card, showing me her character in an unfavourable light from Miss Ethel Pye, who once met me in an omnibus & wishes to take a mask of my head; 4. a letter from Harcourt Brace enclosing cheque from the Forum for O⁠[n]. B⁠[eing]. Ill. 5. a letter asking me to become one of the Committee of the English Association; 6. a cutting on Hogarth Essays from the Dial; 7. a note from Clive asking me to dine to meet his brother. I think this makes me out rather specially important. It is 3 days post. I am rather tired, a little tired, from having thought too much about To the Lighthouse. Never never have I written so easily, imagined so profusely. Murry says my works won’t be read in 10 years time—Well, tonight I get a new edition of the V⁠[oyage]. O⁠[ut]. from Harcourt Brace—this was published 11 years ago."
1926.02.23,"Here is the usual door bell/ & I think Gwen came in, & I was rather sodden & wretched, feeling that I had nothing to give her, & she everything to ask. As I foretold, she is enmeshed in a net of fire: that is the truth; loves net; the fiery net of—who was it?—that was scorched to death: & hers is more painful than his, & more enduring. Yet how seldom one envisages what one knows! Her net lies on me; but it does not burn me. And I do little futile kindnesses to her, which are little good to anybody; & I don’t do them, & I feel compunction. Of all this I have little appetite to write, being exacerbated 1. because Nelly won’t make marmalade; 2. because a certain function impends; 3. because I can’t go, in deference to L.’s wish, to Mortimer’s farewell party, 4. because Dadie asked me to tea, & I did not go; 5. because—the last because I cannot now remember—a vague dissatisfaction: spring & funerals; yellow lights & white blossoms; beautiful black yellow pointed squares—& so on. Vita is a dumb letter writer, & I miss her. I miss the glow & the flattery & the festival. I miss her, I suppose, not very intimately. Nevertheless, I do miss her, & wish it were May 10th; & then I don’t wish it; for I have such a razor edge to my palette that seeing people often disgusts me of seeing them.

I am blown like an old flag by my novel. This one is To the Lighthouse. I think it is worth saying for my own interest that at last at last, after that battle Jacob’s Room, that agony—all agony but the end, Mrs Dalloway, I am now writing as fast & freely as I have written in the whole of my life; more so—20 times more so—than any novel yet. I think this is the proof that I was on the right path; & that what fruit hangs in my soul is to be reached there. Amusingly, I now invent theories that fertility & fluency are the things: I used to plead for a kind of close, terse, effort. Anyhow this goes on all the morning; & I have the devils own work not to be flogging my brain all the afternoon. I live entirely in it, & come to the surface rather obscurely & am often unable to think what to say when we walk round the Square, which is bad I know. Perhaps it may be a good sign for the book though. Of course it is largely known to me: but all my books have been that. It is, I feel, that I can float everything off now; & “everything” is rather a crowd & weight & confusion in the mind.

Then I have seen Lytton: seen Eddy; Mary; I forget: I have been discreet in my society, & enjoyed it. Perhaps I am again brisking, after my lethargy. The publishing season is about to begin. Nessa says Why don’t you give it up? I say, because I enjoy it. Then I wonder, but do I? What about Rome & Sicily? And Manning Sanders is not worth the grind. Am I a fanatical enthusiast for work, like my father? I think I have a strain of that, but I don’t relish it. Tonight Francis Birrell & Rose Macaulay dine with us. To celebrate the occasion, I have bought a toast rack & a bedspread, which covers that atrocious chest of drawers wh. has worried me these 2 years. I am now so pleased with the colour that I go out & look at it."
1926.02.24,"To continue, the second day running which is a rarity, they came last night, Francis & Rose Macaulay—I daresay I shall be calling her Rose one of these days. Francis didn’t much relish meeting her: my gnats of worries gave me little peace: Gwen ringing up; I not cordial; she shying off: I repentant; ringing up again. Then Rose—too chattery chittery at first go off; lean as a rake, wispy, & frittered. Some flimsy smartness & taint of the flimsy glittery literary about her: but this was partly nerves, I think; & she felt us alien & observant doubtless. Anyhow in the middle of dinner the lights went out: only a few candles in saucers to be had, & I left her & Francis alone in the dark to talk. After all, she has no humbug about her; is exactly on a par as far as conventions go, I imagine; only frosted & rather cheaply gilt superficially with all that being asked to speak at dinners, to give opinions to newspapers, & so on; lunching at the League of Nations; dining with Iolo Williams, meeting Jack Squire who has grown whiskers & looks like a verger.

Let me see, there’s some failure of sympathy between Chiswick & Bloomsbury, I think, she said. So we defined Bloomsbury. Her part is to stick up for common sense she said. I elaborated her being Cambridge. She is writing an article for an American paper on London after the War. It is [this] sort of thing that one distrusts in her. Why should she take the field so unnecessarily? But I fancy our ‘leading lady novelists’ all do as they are asked about this, & I am not quite one of them. I saw my own position, a good deal lowered & diminished; & this is part of the value of seeing new people—still more of going to people’s houses. One is, if anything, minimised: here in the eternal Bloomsbury, one is apt, without realising it, to expand. Then Gwen came. I like Francis. I like his laughter; & his random energy. He is a Victorian. Indeed we talked a lot, when L. was in the basement with the electrician, of father, who, said Francis, dominates the 20th Century. “He made it possible for me to have a decent life” he said. “He pulled down the whole edifice, & never knew what he was doing. He never realised that if God went, morality must follow. A remarkable man; for though he would not believe in God, he was stricter than those who did.”

“He loved lamentation” said L. coming up. R.M. said her parents called him always “poor Leslie Stephen” because he had lost his faith. Also they said he was very gentle & charming. Gwen said her father & uncles had a great respect for him. They had a very romantic feeling for my mother.

Because she was so beautiful, I said, proud that R.M. should know this; & felt rather queer, to think how much of this there is in To the Lighthouse, & how all these people will read it & recognise poor Leslie Stephen & beautiful Mrs Stephen in it. Then we talked of knowing people. R.M. said she always knew why she liked people. Gwen being perhaps tired, was a little mystical; or perhaps she has acquired views which are yet hardly articulate. Anyhow Leonard thought her ‘almost imbecile’. They got talking about whether one knew more about pictures or books. R.M. showed up rather well in argument, & maintained that a book is a subjective thing; she attacks authority in literature. But people know about painting as it is a more technical art. Then she said (this makes me think she will wish to be called Rose) how she had dreamt she was staying with us in a cottage in Surrey, a 15th century house, full of old beams & candle lit. In some lights she has the beautiful eyes of all us distinguished women writers; the refinement; the clearness of cut; the patience; & humbleness. It is her voice & manner that make one edgy."
1926.02.27,"I think I shall initiate a new convention for this book—beginning each day on a new page—my habit in writing serious literature. Certainly, I have room to waste a little paper in this year’s book. As for the soul: why did I say I would leave it out? I forget. And the truth is, one can’t write directly about the soul. Looked at, it vanishes: but look at the ceiling, at Grizzle, at the cheaper beasts in the Zoo which are exposed to walkers in Regents Park, & the soul slips in. It slipped in this afternoon. I will write that I said, staring at the bison: answering L. absentmindedly; but what was I going to write?

Mrs Webb’s book has made me think a little what I could say of my own life. I read some of 1923 this morning, being headachy again, & taking a delicious draught of silence. But then there were causes in her life: prayer; principle. None in mine. Great excitability & search after something. Great content—almost always enjoying what I’m at, but with constant change of mood. I don’t think I’m ever bored. Sometimes a little stale; but I have a power of recovery—which I have tested; & am now testing for the 50th time. I have to husband my head still very carefully: but then, as I said to Leonard today, I enjoy epicurean ways of society; sipping & then shutting my eyes to taste. I enjoy almost everything. Yet I have some restless searcher in me. Why is there not a discovery in life? Something one can lay hands on & say “This is it?” My depression is a harassed feeling—I’m looking; but that’s not it—thats not it. What is it? And shall I die before I find it? Then (as I was walking through Russell Sqre last night) I see the mountains in the sky: the great clouds; & the moon which is risen over Persia; I have a great & astonishing sense of something there, which is ‘it’—It is not exactly beauty that I mean. It is that the thing is in itself enough: satisfactory; achieved. A sense of my own strangeness, walking on the earth is there too: of the infinite oddity of the human position; trotting along Russell Sqre with the moon up there, & those mountain clouds. Who am I, what am I, & so on: these questions are always floating about in me; & then I bump against some exact fact—a letter, a person, & come to them again with a great sense of freshness. And so it goes on. But, on this showing which is true, I think, I do fairly frequently come upon this ‘it’; & then feel quite at rest.

Is that what I meant to say? Not in the least. I was thinking about my own character; not about the universe. Oh & about society again; dining with Lord Berners at Clive’s made me think that. How, at a certain moment, I see through what I’m saying; detest myself; & wish for the other side of the moon; reading alone, that is. How many phases one goes through between the soup & the sweet! I want, partly as a writer, to found my impressions on something firmer. I said to Lord B. All you must do in writing is to float off the contents of your mind. Clive & Raymond laughed & said Thats exactly what you do anyhow. And I don’t want that to be all. Nor is it. Theres a good deal of shaping & composing in my books. However—the main idea of them is that, then; & I dont like it.

Lord B. was stockish, resolute, quick witted: analysed his own instability. His father was a sea captain; wished him not on any account to be a long haired artist; his mother used to say “My little boy plays so nicely—you should hear him play” but she minded his not hunting & riding. So, he said, he was inhibited as a musician. His talent clung (I think he said) like a creeper to the edge of a cliff. One day he wrote two marches for fun. Stravinsky saw them, thought them good, & they were published. So he was accepted as a serious musician, with only 4 lessons from Tovey in counterpoint. He had an astonishing facility. He could write things that sounded all right. Suddenly, last year, all his pleasure in it went. He met a painter, asked him how you paint; bought ‘hogsheads’—(meant hog’s bristles) & canvas & copied an Italian picture, brilliantly, consummately, says Clive. Has the same facility there: but it will come to nothing he said, like the other.

What did we talk about? Tom & the Sitwells; Eddie Marsh & Lady Colefax, & I felt one cd. go on saying these things for ever, & they mean nothing. Sure enough, he asked me to dine: & now I say I have a headache & can’t."
1926.03.03,"And I did have a bit of a headache—yes; all this time is rather weathering headaches. Nailing a flag to a mast in a gale, I have just compared writing a novel in London to that, in a letter to Vita. The glow is off my visit to Herbert & Freda at Cookham: a very memorable day. From their windows you look down on the top of old Mr Watkins’ bald head skulling on the Thames. You look at two twisted stakes in the river which I took for cranes; & across Marlow to some hills. They motored us up into the hills, & it was oddly strangely still & bright & empty & full of unblown flowers. We saw a Queen Anne house called—I forget; so high & remote, with turf to its door; & broad alleys; capacious windows, a woman. Well; no one gets more pleasure from these sights than I do; only the wave of pleasure leaves some regret—all this beauty going—going—going: & I in Tavistock Sqre not seeing it. And spiritually it was very interesting. I thought I had found the real human being—something so simple & fitted to its surroundings as to be almost irreflective, in Freda. She is nearer humanity than I am: eats her way into the heart of it, as I cannot. Her thighs are thick with honey. But the impression is dying, as they do, under others—how I lost my little mother of pearl brooch, bought a 16/ hat which I do not like, & must go to tea at Ethel [Sands]’s tomorrow in what then? My own lack of beauty depresses me today. But how far does the old convention about ‘beauty’ bear looking into? I think of the people I have known. Are they beautiful? This problem I leave unsolved.

Raymond gave a fancy dress party on Sunday night. I was torpid with a sleeping draught; & was dozing off, as the carriages arrived at no. 6. Still I envied them; & thought, when Raymond telephoned about the copy of Old Kensington which I gave him & said how lovely Nancy [Cunard] had looked, that I had missed the greatest sight of the season. Happily, Lucas comes to tea, & he says he hears it was a terrible sticky dull party, with not room to turn round in, which greatly pleases me. Lucas, Peter, I should call him, came, from friendship; which friendship, as I suppose, was gently stimulated by my praise of his novel. He is a bony rosy little austere priest; so whole, & sane, & simple throughout one can’t help respecting him, though when it comes to books we disagree. He says Tom &c: have thrown intellect to the winds; given up the ghost; he says Houseman & de la Mare are the real poets. I say poetry is defunct; & Tom &c anyhow try to animate it. The Sitwells, he says, advertise. They’re aristocrats, I say, thinking criticism upstart impertinence on the part of flunkeys. No merit in their works anyhow, he says. But what about this drawing room singer, de la Mare, I ask. The most charming of men. Granted. Granted, on Peter’s side, that he has no coherency whatever—is always darting after strange monsters—goldfish in bowls, I say. Well, but we cant all be great philosophical poets, he says. Anyhow Tom ain’t a drawing room singer, I say. Tom has been down lecturing, & not creating a good impression at Cambridge, I fancy. He tells the young men, in private, how they cook fish in Paris: his damned selfconsciousness again, I suppose. But Peter is, to my mind, too entire in his judgments; founded on book learning & prettiness into the bargain. He has no ascendency of brain: he is not, & now never will be, a personage: which is the one thing needful in criticism, or writing of any sort, I think; for we’re all as wrong as wrong can be. But character is the thing."
1926.03.09,"Then I was at two parties: Ethel’s tea; Mary’s dinner.

Ethel’s was a ghastly frizzly frying pan affair. I chattering in front of the footlights.

Well, said Ott. how are you? You look wonderfully well; as if you had never had an illness in your life.

(Now what does she say that for? To get pity for herself, sure enough.)

I can’t say I’m any better.

But she is all dressed like a girl of 18; tomato coloured Georgette & fur.

Ethel says, tittering

What a nice hat.

I’m all windblown in my old felt, come through the snow, with Dadie.

Well, I say to myself, I’ll see this through anyhow, take my seat as on a throne, & proceed, first to little smug Leigh Ashton: Read wrote that Times Leader this morning (quoting me & Joyce as examples of good prose versus death of Queen Victoria).

I should so much like to know if you think its well written—such a charming man.

Then diversion: Ethel; Ottoline: Percy Lubbock.

Are the Russians more passionate than we are?

No; I say; I have all the passions. Asked to define a dramatic scene; how Leonard says “I think the worse of you for ever” when I accept Ott’s invitation. Suddenly I remember it was Ott’s invitation. If Mr Lubbock had a daughter he would have scenes—this is sheer egotistical cruelty on Ott’s part; so home, holding Dadie by the arm; talking about his fellowship, to be announced on Saturday, (But Peter thinks he won’t get it) & abusing Chelsea, & Ottoline; & saying how unpopular I made myself.

As for Mary’s party, there, save for the usual shyness about powder & paint, shoes & stockings, I was happy, owing to the supremacy of literature. This keeps us sweet & sane, George Moore & me I mean.

He has a pink foolish face; blue eyes like hard marbles; a crest of snowhite hair; little unmuscular hands; sloping shoulders; a high stomach; neat, purplish well brushed clothes; & perfect manners, as I consider them. That is to say he speaks without fear or dominance; accepting me on my merits; every one on their merits. Still in spite of age uncowed, unbeaten, lively, shrewd. As for Hardy & Henry James though, what shall one say?

“I am a fairly modest man; but I admit I think Esther Waters a better book than Tess.”

But what is there to be said for that man? He cannot write. He cannot tell a story. The whole art of fiction consists in telling a story. Now he makes a woman confess. How does he do it? In the third person—a scene that should be moving, impressive. Think how Tolstoi would have done it!

But, said Jack [Hutchinson] War & Peace is the greatest novel in the world. I remember the scene where Natasha puts on a moustache, & Rostov sees her for the first time as she is & falls in love with her.

No, my good friend, there is nothing very wonderful in that. That is an ordinary piece of observation. But my good friend (to me—half hesitating to call me this) what have you to say for Hardy? You cannot find anything to say. English fiction is the worst part of English literature. Compare it with the French—with the Russians. Henry James wrote some pretty little stories before he invented his jargon. But they were about rich people. You cannot write stories about rich people; because, I think he said, they have no instincts. But Henry James was enamoured of marble balustrades. There was no passion in any of his people. And Anne Brontë was the greatest of the Brontës & Conrad could not write, & so on. But this is out of date."
1926.03.20,"But what is to become of all these diaries, I asked myself yesterday. If I died, what would Leo make of them? He would be disinclined to burn them; he could not publish them. Well, he should make up a book from them, I think; & then burn the body. I daresay there is a little book in them: if the scraps & scratches were straightened out a little. God knows.

This is dictated by a slight melancholia, which comes upon me sometimes now, & makes me think I am old: I am ugly. I am repeating things. Yet, as far as I know, as a writer I am only now writing out my mind.

Dining with Clive last night to meet Lord Ivor Spencer Churchill—an elegant attenuated gnat like youth; very smooth, very supple, with the semi-transparent face of a flower, & the legs of a gazelle, & the white waistcoat & diamond buttons of a dandy, & all an Americans desire to understand psycho-analysis—I thought of my own age. I made a horrid gaffe early on: said I liked a picture, which I did not like, & found I was wrong. Now if I had followed my instinct, as one should do, I should have been right. For some extraordinary reason, this poisoned my evening, slightly. The Lord analysed everything very ingeniously: he is a clever boy. I was greatly impressed by masculine cleverness, & their ability to toss balls swiftly & surely to & fro: no butter fingers; all clean catches. Adrian Bishop came in; a ruddy bull frog; & then I went, & Clive, with a discrimination which was affectionate, but not just, apologised, thinking I had not talked enough for my pleasure; whereas I had said the wrong thing, & been depressed over that. Otherwise the evening amused me, & I wanted, like a child, to stay & argue. True, the argument was passing my limits—how if Einstein is true, we shall be able to foretell our own lives. Fortune tellers can now read one’s mind exactly according to Lord Ivor, who, by the bye, had read neither Henry James nor V.W., is about 23, & came to the Press this morning, obediently, to buy my complete works. No intellectual would have done that. They are excessively anxious to save their souls—these aristocrats; witness Lord Berners the other night, sending out for Peacock—on my recommendation.

Otherwise, we had Bea Howe to dinner; & went to Philip [Woolf]’s one hot still day of the usual loveliness, & saw the place, & the horses, & the pepper box towers of Waddesdon, & I liked the immense directness & uncloudedness of Babs; but says Eddy [Sackville-West] who came to tea on Sunday, this is “I assure you” all my imagination. She would be very dull if you knew her. He knows dozens of her. Who is not dull? Only B⁠[loomsbur]’y according to Eddy.

Then there was Sybil Colefax: she comes to heel promptly: no, I won’t go there; she may have a little cheap tea here, which she does, gratefully. She has done America with the usual dashing, joyless efficiency; could not analyse, merely report. Charlie Chaplin such a mixture of subtlety & common⁠[n]⁠ess: but why? No instances available, so I infer that she picked this up second hand, perhaps from Esme Howard; perhaps from Coolidge, or from Douglas Fairbanks or from the Italian boy who drove the car. Like a good housewife, which she is, she is making Peter begin life hard, cooking his breakfast, down on Wall Street by 9. There is a strain of hard, serious, professionalism in her, quite unmitigated by all the splendours of Argyll House."
1926.03.24,"“I’m going to hand in my resignation this morning” said L. making the coffee.

To what? I asked.

“The Nation”.

And it is done; & we have six months only before us. I feel 10 years younger; the shafts off our shoulders again & the world before us. I can’t pretend to make much of a to-do about this either way. It was a temporary makeshift job, amusing at first, then galling, & last night, after an argument of the usual kind about literary articles & space & so on with Maynard & Hubert L. came to the decision to resign now. There was no quarrel. Oddly enough, having tea with Nessa, she had set me thinking the same thing. Phil [Noel-]⁠Baker had said to her he thought L. the best living writer, & what a pity it was he spent so much time on the Nation & the Press. So there was I beginning, don’t you think we might give them up!—when L. came in with his contribution to the question. He was dining with Clive, so the discussion waited till this morning; was decided by 10; in the hands of the Chief by 11—& now thank God no more chiefs for either of us so long as we live I hope.

The situation appears to be that L. shall make £300; I £200—& really I don’t suppose we shall find it hard; & then the mercy of having no ties, no proofs, no articles to procure, & all that, is worth a little more exertion elsewhere, should it come to that. I’m amused at my own sense of liberation. To upset everything every 3 or 4 years is my notion of a happy life. Always to be tacking to get into the eye of the wind. Now a prudent life is, as L. pointed out in the Square the opposite of this. One ought to stick in the same place. But with £400 assured & no children, why imitate a limpet in order to enjoy a limpets safety? The next question will be, I see, the Press. Shall we give that up too, & so be quit of everything? Its not such an easy question, or so pressing. I sometimes wish it. For, speaking selfishly, it has served my turn: given me a chance of writing off my own bat, & now I doubt if Heinemann or Cape would much intimidate me. But then there’s the fun—which is considerable. The time will come, at this rate, when we have nothing in the world to resign: then, to get the effect of change, one will have to accept. We say we will travel & see the world. Anyhow I make my usual prediction—we shall be richer this time next year without the Nation than with it.

I rather like feeling that I have to earn money. I intensely dislike being in office, in any post of authority. I dislike being in people’s pay. This of course is part of the reason why I like writing for the Press. But I suppose freedom becomes a fetish like any other. These disjointed reflections I scribble on a divine, if gusty, day; being about, after reading Anna Karenina, to dine at a pot-house with Rose Macaulay—not a cheerful entertainment; but an experience perhaps.

Lydia came into the room when L. was talking to Maynard this morning to show him her Zebra shoes, which cost £5.8.6. & they were really lizard, L. says. Also it is curious how a change like this destroys formality⁠[?]—dissipates the elements."
1926.03.27,"To continue—I don’t know why I should really tell the story of the Nation—it doesn’t figure largely in our lives. But Leonard met Phil Baker, who says he will get £300 as lecturer at the School of Economics easily if he wants it. He came in that night & said this & then we went off on a blowing night to dine at Rose M.’s ‘pothouse’, as I so mistakenly called it. There were 10 second rate writers in second rate dress clothes, Lynds, Goulds, O’Donovan: no, I won’t in any spasm of hypocritical humanity include Wolves. L. by the way was in his red brown tweed. Then the pitter patter began; the old yard was scratched over by these baldnecked chickens. The truth was that we had no interests private; literature was our common ground; & though I will talk literature with Desmond or Lytton by the hour, when it comes to pecking up grains with these active stringy fowls my gorge rises. What d’you think of the Hawthornden prize? Why isn’t Masefield as good as Chaucer, or Gerhardi as good as Tchekov: how can I embark with Gerald Gould on such topics? He reads novels incessantly; got a holiday 3 years ago, & prided himself on reading nothing but Tchekhov; knows all about a novel in the first chapter. Sylvias & Geralds & Roberts & Roses chimed & tinkled round the table. A stout woman called Gould got steadily more & more mustard & tomato coloured. I said Holy Ghost? when Mr O’Donovan said the whole of the coast. Lodged on a low sofa in Rose’s underground cheerful, sane, breezy room I talked to a young cultivated man, who turned out to be Hinks, Roger, British Museum, mild aesthete, variety of Leigh Ashton; but thank God, not a second rate journalist. All the time I kept saying to myself Thank God to be out of that; out of the Nation; no longer brother in arms with Rose & Robert & Sylvia. It is a thinblooded set; so ‘nice’, ‘kind’, respectable, cleverish & in the swim.

Then our set at Nessa’s last night, was hardly at its best. L. & Adrian silent & satirical; old Sickert rather toothless & set; I driven to chatter, not well; but Nessa & Duncan don’t consolidate & order these parties; so home in a spasm of outraged vanity, & not that altogether, for I had worked honestly if feebly, & L. had not; & then he was off early this morning to Rodmell where Philcox is in the thick of building & drains: so I had no time to uncrease my rose leaf; had to try & work, to finish the rather long drawn out dinner scene [in To the Lighthouse], & was just striking oil when in comes Angus to tell me Eddy was on the phone: would I go to Rimsky Korsakov with him on Tuesday. I agreed—more, asked him to dinner. Then was all a whirl & flutter of doubts; detested the engagement; could not settle; suddenly shook my coat, like a retriever; faced facts; sent Eddy a wire, & a letter “Cant come—detest engagements”, & pondered where shall I spend the day? decided on Greenwich, arrived there at 1; lunched; everything fell out pat; smoked a cigarette on the pier promenade, saw the ships swinging up, one two, three, out of the haze; adored it all; yes even the lavatory keepers little dog; saw the grey Wren buildings fronting the river; & then another great ship, grey & orange; with a woman walking on deck; & then to the hospital; first to the Museum where I saw Sir John Franklin’s pen & spoons (a spoon asks a good deal of imagination to consecrate it)—I played with my mind watching what it would do,—& behold if I didn’t almost burst into tears over the coat Nelson wore at Trafalgar with the medals which he hid with his hand when they carried him down, dying, lest the sailors might see it was him. There was too, his little fuzzy pigtail, of golden greyish hair tied in black; & his long white stockings, one much stained, & his white breeches with the gold buckles, & his stock—all of which I suppose they must have undone & taken off as he lay dying. Kiss me Hardy &c—Anchor, anchor,—I read it all when I came in, & could swear I was there on the Victory—So the charm worked in that case. Then it was raining a little, but I went into the Park, which is all prominence & radiating paths; then back on top of a bus, & so to tea. Molly [McCarthy] came, a warm faithful bear, of whom I am really fond, judging from the steady accumulation of my desire to see her these last 3 or 4 weeks, culminating in my asking her to come, as I so rarely ask anyone to come. Saxon came, with his great grandfather’s diary, which it pleases him I should like, & call like him; & then reading & bed. I think my rose leaf is now uncrumpled. Certainly I shall remember the ships coming up (here Tomlin rings, but I won’t see him—solitude is my bride, & she is adulterated by Clive & Mary tonight) & Nelson’s coat long after I have forgotten how silly & uncomfortable I was at Nessa’s on Friday."
1926.04.09,"Life has been very good to the Leafs. I should say it has been perfect. Why then all this pother about life? It can produce old Walter, bubbling & chubby; & old Lotta, stately & content; & little Kitty, as good & nice as can be; & handsome Charles, as loving & affectionate. Plunge deep into Walter’s life & it is all sound & satisfactory. His son kisses him & says “Bless you father”. He sinks back chuckling on his cushions. He chooses a maccaroon. He tells a story. Lotta purrs⁠[?], in her black velvet dress. Only I am exiled from this profound natural happiness. That is what I always feel; or often feel now—natural happiness is what I lack, in profusion. I have intense happiness—not that. It is therefore what I most envy; geniality & family love & being on the rails of human life. Indeed, exaggeration apart, this is a very satisfactory form of existence. And it exists for thousands of people all the time. Why have we none of us got it, in that measure? Old & young agreeing to live together: & being normal; & clever enough of course; yet not stinted or self-conscious in emotion. Much of this may be the generalised & harmonious view which one gets of unknown people as a whole. I might not think it if I saw more of them. Writers do not live like that perhaps. But it is useless frittering away the impression which is so strong. Also I keep thinking “They pity me. They wonder what I find in life.” Then I sink a little silent, & rouse myself to talk to Kitty. Also I know that nothing Leonard or I have done—not our books or the Press or anything means anything to Lotta & Walter & Charles & very little to Kitty. Charles has his motor at the door. They are perfectly happy, motoring off to Berkhamstead, which will take an hour, so they are among the lanes even now. A spring night & so on."
1926.04.11,"Cannot read Mrs Webb because at any moment S. Tomlin may ring the bell. Also I wanted to go on about the Leafs. I have almost forgotten the impression they made on me. I have wrapped myself round in my own personality again. How does it come about—these sudden intense changes of view? Perhaps my life, writing imagining, is unusually conscious: very vivid to me: & then, going to tea with the Leafs destroys it more completely than other people’s lives because my life is saying to itself “This is life—the only life”. But when I enter a complete world of its own; where Walter cracks a joke, I realise that this is existing whether I exist or not; & so get bowled over. Violent as they are, these impressions go quickly; leaving a sediment of ideas which I shall discuss with L. perhaps when we go to Iwerne Minster. About natural happiness: how it is destroyed by our way of life.

Mrs Webb’s Life makes me compare it with mine. The difference is that she is trying to relate all her experiences to history. She is very rational & coherent. She has always thought about her life & the meaning of the world: indeed, she begins this at the age of 4. She has studied herself as a phenomenon. Thus her autobiography is part of the history of the 19th Century. She is the product of science, & the lack of faith in God; she was secreted by the Time Spirit. Anyhow she believes this to be so; & makes herself fit in very persuasively & to my mind very interestingly. She taps a great stream of thought. Unlike that self-conscious poseur Walter Raleigh she is much more interested in facts & truth than in what will shock people & what a professor ought not to say. Tomlin does not seem to be coming, & L. is at Staines, so I will try a little reading."
1926.04.18,"This is written

This is not written very seriously.—obviously not—to try a pen, I think. And it is now [Friday] April 30th, the last of a wet windy month, excepting the sudden opening of all the doors at Easter, & the summer displayed blazing, as it always is, I suppose; only cloud hidden. I have not said anything about Iwerne Minster. Now it would amuse me to see what I remember it by. Cranbourne Chase: the stunted aboriginal forest trees, scattered, not grouped in cultivations; anemones, bluebells, violets, all pale, sprinkled about, without colour, livid, for the sun hardly shone. Then Blackmore Vale; a vast air dome & the fields dropped to the bottom; the sun striking, there, there; a drench of rain falling, like a veil streaming from the sky, there & there; & the downs rising, very strongly scarped (if that is the word) so that they were ridged & ledged; then an inscription in a church “sought peace & ensured it”, & the question, who wrote these sonorous stylistic epitaphs?—& all the cleanliness of Iwerne village, its happiness & well being, making me ask, as we tended to sneer. Still this is the right method, surely; & then tea & cream—these I remember: the hot baths; my new leather coat; Shaftesbury, so much lower & less commanding than my imagination, & the drive to Bournemouth, & the dog & the lady behind the rock, & the view of Swanage, & coming home.

And then it was horror: Nelly; faced her going; was firm yet desolate; on Tuesday she stopped me on the landing said “Please ma’am may I apologise?” & this time we had been so resolute & implicitly believed her that I had written 6 letters. No cooks however came; & I had enough look into the ‘servant question’ to be glad to be safe again with Nelly. Now I vow come what may, never never to believe her again. “I am too fond of you ever to be happy with anyone else” she said. Talking of compliments, this is perhaps the greatest I could have. But my mind is wandering. It is a question of clothes. This is what humiliates me—talking of compliments—to walk in Regent St, Bond Str &c: & be notably less well dressed than other people.

Yesterday I finished the first part of To the Lighthouse, & today began the second. I cannot make it out—here is the most difficult abstract piece of writing—I have to give an empty house, no people’s characters, the passage of time, all eyeless & featureless with nothing to cling to: well, I rush at it, & at once scatter out two pages. Is it nonsense, is it brilliance? Why am I so flown with words, & apparently free to do exactly what I like? When I read a bit it seems spirited too; needs compressing, but not much else. Compare this dashing fluency with the excruciating hard wrung battles I had with Mrs Dalloway (save the end). This is not made up: it is the literal fact. Yes, & I am rather famous. For the rest, we dally about the Nation. Maynard, dressed in a light overcoat, is back; hums & haws about standing for the Provost of King’s. We tell him Lydia would like it. He says it means middle age & respectability. I feel some sympathy for him. This is because he is going grey, I tell Clive. Clive’s back; Nessa departing, & I worrying about my clothes, & how Roger last night upset me by saying that Nessa finds fault with my temper behind my back. Then (at Ralph’s new left handed establishment) Inez, rather like Vivien [Eliot] to look at, searches into my eyes with her greenish pink-rimmed ones, & says, I must tell you two things: then she tells me that she admires me. That swallowed (doubtfully) she says, Did you ever have an affair with Oliver? The connection is this: she disliked me, from jealousy. I protest I never kissed him, & he never looked at me. She refuses to believe. So she has been refusing to believe for years—A queer little interview, stage managed by Oliver* & she: at last brought off. I called in Leonard, & I think convinced her.

* Oliver denied all knowledge of this; & said she invented it in order to have an excuse for an intimate conversation. “So many women are like that” said Rose Macaulay sitting spruce lean, like a mummified cat, in her chair (this is written Aug. 12th)"
1926.05.05,"An exact diary of the Strike would be interesting. For instance, it is now a ¼ to 2: there is a brown fog; nobody is building; it is drizzling. The first thing in the morning we stand at the window & watch the traffic in Southampton Row. This is incessant. Everyone is bicycling; motor cars are huddled up with extra people. There are no buses. No placards, no newspapers. The men are at work in the road; water, gas & electricity are allowed; but at 11 the light was turned off. I sat in the press in the brown fog, while L. wrote an article for the Herald. A very revolutionary looking young man on a cycle arrived with the British Gazette. L. is to answer an article in this. All was military stem a little secret. Then Clive dropped in, the door being left open. He is offering himself to the Government. Maynard excited, wants the H⁠[ogarth]. P⁠[ress]. to bring out a skeleton number of the Nation. It is all tedious & depressing, rather like waiting in a train outside a station. Rumours are passed round—that the gas wd. be cut off at 1—false of course. One does not know what to do. And nature has laid it on thick today—fog, rain, cold. A voice, rather commonplace & official, yet the only common voice left, wishes us good morning at 10. This is the voice of Britain, to wh. we can make no reply. The voice is very trivial, & only tells us that the Prince of Wales is coming back (from Biarritz), that the London streets present an unprecedented spectacle."
1926.05.06,"(one of the curious effects of the Strike is that it is difficult to remember the day of the week). Everything is the same, but unreasonably, or because of the weather, or habit, we are more cheerful, take less notice, & occasionally think of other things. The taxis are out today. There are various skeleton papers being sold. One believes nothing. Clive dines in Mayfair, & everyone is pro-men; I go to Harrison [dentist], & he shouts me down with “Its red rag versus Union Jack, Mrs Woolf” & how Thomas has 100,000. Frankie dines out, & finds everyone pro-Government. Bob [Trevelyan] drops in & says Churchill is for peace, but Baldwin wont budge. Clive says Churchill is for tear gas bombs, fight to the death, & is at the bottom of it all. So we go on, turning in our cage. I notice how frequently we break of⁠[f] with “Well I don’t know.” According to L. this open state of mind is due to the lack of papers. It feels like a deadlock, on both sides; as if we could keep fixed like this for weeks. What one prays for is God: the King or God; some impartial person to say kiss & be friends—as apparently we all desire.

Just back from a walk to the Strand. Of course one notices lorries full of elderly men & girls standing like passengers in the old 3rd class carriages. Children swarm. They pick up bits of old wood paving. Everything seems to be going fast, away, in business⁠[?]. The shops are open but empty. Over it all is some odd pale unnatural atmosphere—great activity but no normal life. I think we shall become more independent & stoical as the days go on. And I am involved in dress buying with Todd [editor of Vogue]; I tremble & shiver all over at the appalling magnitude of the task I have undertaken—to go to a dressmaker recommended by Todd, even, she suggested, but here my blood ran cold, with Todd. Perhaps this excites me more feverishly than the Strike. It is a little like the early hours of the morning (this state of things) when one has been up all night. Business improved today. We sold a few books. Bob cycled from Leith Hill, getting up at 5 a.m. to avoid the crowd. He punctured an hour later, met his tailor who mended him, set forth again, was almost crushed in the crowd near London, & has since been tramping London, from Chelsea to Bloomsbury to gather gossip, & talk, incoherently about Desmond’s essays & his own poetry. He has secreted two more of these works which ‘ought to be published’. He is ravenous greedy, & apelike, but has a kind of russet surly charm; like a dog one teases. He complained how Logan teased him. Clive calls in to discuss bulletins—indeed, more than anything it is like a house where someone is dangerously ill; & friends drop in to enquire, & one has to wait for doctor’s news—Quennel, the poet, came; a lean boy, nervous, plaintive, rather pretty; on the look out for work, & come to tap the Wolves—who are said, I suppose to be an authority on that subject. We suggested Desmond’s job. After an hour of this, he left,——here Clive came in & interrupted. He has been shopping in the West End with Mary. Nothing to report there. He & L. listened in at 7 & heard nothing. The look of the streets—how people “trek to work” that is the stock phrase: that it will be cold & windy tomorrow (it is shivering cold today) that there was a warm debate in the Commons—

Among the crowd of trampers in Kingsway were old Pritchard, toothless, old wispy, benevolent; who tapped L. on the shoulder & said he was “training to shoot him”; & old Miss Pritchard, equally frail, dusty, rosy, shabby. “How long will it last Mrs Woolf?” “Four weeks” “Ah dear!” Off they tramp, over the bridge to Kennington I think; next in Kingsway comes the old battered clerk, who has 5 miles to walk. Miss Talbot has an hours walk; Mrs Brown 2 hours walk. But they all arrive, & clatter about as usual—Pritchard doing poor peoples work for nothing, as I imagine his way is, & calling himself a Tory.

Then we are fighting the Square on the question of leading dogs. Dogs must be led; but tennis can be played they say. L. is advancing to the fight, & has enlisted the Pekinese in the Square. We get no news from abroad; neither can send it. No parcels. Pence have been added to milk, vegetables &c. And Karin has bought 4 joints.

It is now a chilly lightish evening; very quiet; the only sound a distant barrel organ playing. The bricks stand piled on the building & there remain. And Viola was about to make our fortune. She dined here, Monday night, the night of the strike."
1926.05.07,"No change. “London calling the British Isles. Good morning everyone”. That is how it begins at 10. The only news that the archbishops are conferring, & ask our prayers that they may be guided right. Whether this means action, we know not. We know nothing. Mrs Cartwright walked from Hampstead. She & L. got heated arguing, she being antilabour; because she does not see why they should be supported, & observes men in the street loafing instead of working. Very little work done by either of us today. A cold, wet day, with sunny moments. All arrangements unchanged. Girl came to make chair covers, having walked from Shoreditch, but enjoyed it. Times sent for 25 Violas. Question whether to bring out a skeleton Roneo Nation. Leonard went to the office, I to the Brit⁠[ish] Mus⁠[eum]; where all was chill serenity, dignity & severity. Written up are the names of great men; & we all cower like mice nibbling crumbs in our most official discreet impersonal mood beneath. I like this dusty bookish atmosphere. Most of the readers seemed to have rubbed their noses off & written their eyes out. Yet they have a life they like—believe in the necessity of making books, I suppose: verify, collate, make up other books, for ever. It must be 15 years since I read here. I came home & found L. & Hubert [Henderson] arriving from the office—Hubert did what is now called “taking a cup of tea”, which means an hour & a halfs talk about the Strike. Here is his prediction: if it is not settled, or in process, on Monday, it will last 5 weeks. Today no wages are paid. Leonard said he minded this more than the war & Hubert told us how he had travelled in Germany, & what brutes they were in 1912. He thinks gas & electricity will go next; had been at a journalists meeting where all were against labour (against the general strike that is) & assumed Government victory. L. says if the state wins & smashes T⁠[rades]. U⁠[nion]⁠s he will devote his life to labour: if the archbishop succeeds, he will be baptised. Now to dine at the Commercio to meet Clive."
1926.05.09,"There is no news of the strike. The broadcaster has just said that we are praying today. And L. & I quarrelled last night. I dislike the tub thumper in him; he the irrational Xtian in me. I will write it all out later—my feelings about the Strike; but I am now writing to test my theory that there is consolation in expression. Unthinkingly, I refused just now to lunch with the Phil Bakers, who fetched L. in their car. Suddenly, 10 minutes ago, I began to regret this profoundly. How I should love the talk, & seeing the house, & battling my wits against theirs. Now the sensible thing to do is to provide some pleasure to balance this, which I cd. not have had, if I had gone. I can only think of writing this, & going round the Square. Obscurely, I have my clothes complex to deal with. When I am asked out my first thought is, but I have no clothes to go in. Todd has never sent me the address of the shop; & I may have annoyed her by refusing to lunch with her. But the Virginia who refuses is a very instinctive & therefore powerful person. The reflective & sociable only comes to the surface later. Then the conflict.

Baldwin broadcast last night: he rolls his rs; tries to put more than mortal strength into his words. “Have faith in me. You elected me 18 months ago. What have I done to forfeit your confidence? Can you not trust me to see justice done between man & man?” Impressive as it is to hear the very voice of the Prime Minister, descendant of Pitt & Chatham, still I can’t heat up my reverence to the right pitch. I picture the stalwart oppressed man, bearing the world on his shoulders. And suddenly his self assertiveness becomes a little ridiculous. He becomes megalomaniac. No I dont trust him: I don’t trust any human being, however loud they bellow & roll their rs."
1926.05.10,"Quarrel with L. settled in studio. Oh, but how incessant the arguments & interruptions are! As I write, L. is telephoning to Hubert. We are getting up a petition. There was a distinct thaw (we thought) last night. The Arch B. & Grey both conciliatory. So we went to bed happy. Today ostensibly the same dead lock; beneath the surface all sorts of currents, of which we get the most contradictory reports. Dear old Frankie has a story (over the fire in the bookshop) of an interview between Asquith & Reading which turned Reading hostile to the men. Later, through Clive, through Desmond, Asquith is proved to be at the Wharfe, 60 miles from Lord Reading. Lady Wimbore gave a party—brought Thomas & Baldwin together. Meeting mysteriously called off today. Otherwise strike wd. have been settled. I to H of Commons this morning with L.’s article to serve as stuffing for Hugh Dalton in the Commons this afternoon. All this humbug of police & marble statues vaguely displeasing. But the Gvt. provided me with buses both ways, & no stones thrown. Silver & crimson guard at Whitehall; the cenotaph, & men bare heading themselves. Home to find Tom Marshall caballing with L.; after lunch to [Birrell & Garnett’s] bookshop, where the gossip (too secret for the telephone) was imparted; to London Library where Gooch—a tall, pale mule, affable & long winded, was seen, & Molly dustily diligently reading the Dublin Review for 1840, walk home; Clive, to refute gossip; James to get St Loe to sign; then Maynard ringing up to command us to print the Nation as the N. Statesman is printed; to wh. I agreed, & L. disagreed; then dinner; a motor car collision—more telephones ringing at the moment 9.5."
1926.05.11,"I may as well continue to write—this book is used to scandalous mistreatment—while I wait—here interruptions began which lasted till the present moment/ when I write from 12.30 to 3 with Gerald Brenan in the study composing with infinite difficulty a letter to Mr Galsworthy. Arguing about the Ar⁠[chbisho]⁠p of Canterbury with Jack Squire at 12 seems now normal, but not—how often do I repeat—nearly as exciting as writing To the Lighthouse or about de Q⁠[uincey]. I believe it is false psychology to think that in after years these details willl be interesting. The war is now barren sand after all. But one never knows: & waiting about, writing serves to liberate the mind from the fret & itch of these innumerable details. Squire doesn’t want to “knuckle under”. To kneel is the duty of the Church. The Church has no connection with the nation. Events are that the Roneo workers refuse to set up L.’s article in the Nation, in which he says that the Strike is not illegal or unconstitutional. Presumably this is a little clutch of the Government throttle. Mr Baldwin has been visiting the Zoo. In the middle of lunch admirable Miss Bulley arrives, having visited Conway unsuccessfully. St Loe has joined. So Rose Macaulay & Lytton. Tonight the names are to be handed in; & then perhaps silence will descend upon us. Ralph & Gerald are our emissaries. But then everyone rings up—the most unlikely people—[Donald] Brace for instance, Kahan; the woman comes with the new sofa cover. Yesterday Ralph & Frances Marshall were in a railway accident. She had her teeth jangled. One man was killed; another had his leg broken—the result of driving a train without signals, by the efforts of ardent optimistic undergraduates. Billing has been in to say he will print anything, all his men being back & needing work. So, as poor MacDermott has been dead since January, perhaps the Nation will be done by them. Come to think of it, almost all our type is standing, so our printing was in any case hardly feasible. Must I now ring up James? Day’s Library boy was set upon by roughs, had his cycle overturned, but kept his books & was unhurt after calling here for 6 Tree. Tree dribbles along. There is an occasional order. Mrs C⁠[artwright]. arrives on Faith’s bicycle which is red with rust."
1926.05.12,"Strike settled, (ring at bell)

The Strike was settled about 1.15—or it was then broadcast. I was in Tottenham Court Rd. at 1 & heard Bartholomew & Fletcher’s megaphone declaim that the T.U.C. leaders were at Downing Street; came home to find that neither L. or Nelly had heard this: 5 minutes later, the wireless. They told us to stand by & await important news. Then a piano played a tune. Then the solemn broadcaster assuming incredible pomp & gloom & speaking one word to the minute read out: Message from 10 Downing Street. The T.U.C. leaders have agreed that Strike shall be withdrawn. Instantly L. dashed off to telephone to the office, Nelly to tell Pritchard’s clerk, & I to Mrs C. (But N⁠[elly]. was beforehand) then we finished lunch; then I rang up Clive—who proposes that we should have a drink tonight. I saw this morning 5 or 6 armoured cars slowly going along Oxford Street; on each two soldiers sat in tin helmets, & one stood with his hand at the gun which was pointed straight ahead ready to fire. But I also noticed on one a policeman smoking a cigarette. Such sights I dare say I shall never see again; & dont in the least wish to. Already (it is now 10 past 2) men have appeared at the hotel with drainpipes. Also Grizzle has won her case against the Square."
1926.05.13,"I suppose all pages devoted to the Strike will be skipped, when I read over this book. Oh that dull old chapter, I shall say. Excitements about what are called real things are always unutterably transitory. Yet it is gloomy—& L. is gloomy, & so am I unintelligibly—today because the Strike continues—no railwaymen back: vindictiveness has now seized our masters. Government shillyshallies. Apparently, the T.U.C. agreed to terms wh. the miners now reject. Anyhow it will take a week to get the machinery of England to run again. Trains are dotted about all over England. Labour, it seems clear, will be effectively diddled again, & perhaps rid of its power to make strikes in future. Printers still out at the Nation. In short, the strain removed, we all fall out & bicker & backbite. Such is human nature—& really I dont like human nature unless all candied over with art. We dined with a strike party last night & went back to Clive’s. A good deal was said about art there. Good dull Janet Vaughan, reminding me of Emma, joined us. I went to my dressmaker, Miss Brooke, & found it the most quiet & friendly & even enjoyable of proceedings. I have a great lust for lovely stuffs, & shapes; wh. I have not gratified since Sally Young died. A bold move this, but now I’m free of the fret of clothes, which is worth paying for, & need not parade Oxford Street."
1926.05.20,"Waiting for L. to come back from chess with Roger: 11.25. I think nothing need be said of the Strike. As tends to happen, one’s mind slips after the crisis, & what the settlement is, or will be, I know not.

We must now fan the books up again. Viola & Phil Baker were both struck on the wing. Viola comes, very tactfully, as a friend, she says, to consult after dinner. She is a flamboyant creature—much of an actress—much abused by the Waleys & Marjories; but rather taking to me. She has the great egotism, the magnification of self, which any bodily display, I think, produces. She values women by their hips & ankles, like horses. Easily reverts to the topic of her own charms: how she shd. have married the D. of Rutland. “Lord —— (his uncle) told me I was the woman John really loved. The duchess said to me ‘Do make love to John & get him away from ——. At any rate you’re tall & beautiful—’ And I sometimes think if I’d married him—but he never asked me—Daddy wouldn’t have died. I’d have prevented that operation: Then how he’d have loved a duke for a son in law! All his life was dressing up—that sort of thing you know.” So she runs on, in the best of clothes, easy & familiar, but reserved too; with the wiles & warinesses of a woman of the world, half sordid half splendid, not quite at her ease with us, yet glad of a room where she can tell her stories, of listeners to whom she is new & strange. She will run on by the hour—yet is very watchful not to bore; a good business woman, & floating over considerable acuteness on her charm. All this however, is not making her book move, as they say.

Eddy came in to tea. I like him—his flattery? his nobility? I dont know—I find him easy & eager. And Vita comes to lunch tomorrow, which will be a great amusement & pleasure. I am amused at my relations with her: left so ardent in January—& now what? Also I like her presence & her beauty. Am I in love with her? But what is love? Her being ‘in love’ (it must be comma’d thus) with me, excites & flatters; & interests. What is this ‘love’? Oh & then she gratifies my eternal curiosity: who’s she seen, whats she done—for I have no enormous opinion of her poetry. How could I—I who have such delight in mitigating the works even of my greatest friends. I should have been reading her poem tonight: instead finished Sharon Turner—a prosy, simple, old man; the very spit & image of Saxon, a boundless bore, I daresay, with the most intense zeal for “improving myself”, & the holiest affections, & 13 children, & no character or impetus—a love of long walks, of music; modest, yet conceited in an ant like way. I mean he has the industry & persistency in recounting compliments of an ant, but so little character that one hardly calls him vain!"
1926.05.25,"The heat has come, bringing with it the inexplicably disagreeable memories of parties, & George Duckworth; a fear haunts me even now, as I drive past Park Lane on top of a bus, & think of Lady Arthur Russell & so on. I become out of love with everything; but fall into love as the bus reaches Holborn. A curious transition that, from tyranny to freedom. Mixed with it is the usual “I thought that when you died last May, Charles, there had died along with you”—death being hidden among the leaves: & Nessa’s birthday among the little hard pink rosettes of the may, which we used to stop & smell on the pavement at the top of Hyde Pk. Gate & I asked why, if it was may, it did not come out on the 1st; it comes out now, & Nessa’s birthday, which must be her 47th, is in a few days. She is in Italy: Duncan is said to have “committed a nuisance” for which he has been fined 10 lira.

L. has been having Nelly’s poisonous cold, brought by Lottie—Do I hear him? Grizzle says Yes: stands tail wagging—She is right. Vita has it; or I should be dining—

Now we have been sitting in the Square. L. is better. I am happier. Tomorrow we go to Rodmell—to find the bath & the W.C. & the drawing room with the wall pulled down. This cherry has been dangled & withdrawn so often that I scarcely believe we shall now munch it. And I must notice that the Strike still makes it necessary for me to find out trains at Victoria.

I have finished sketchily I admit—the 2nd part of To the Lighthouse—& may, then, have it all written over by the end of July. A record—7 months, if it so turns out.

So Vita came: & I register the shock of meeting after absence; how shy one is; how disillusioned by the actual body; how sensitive to new shades of tone something ‘womanly’ I detected, more mature; & she was shabbier, come straight off in her travelling clothes; & not so beautiful, as sometimes perhaps; & so we sat talking on the sofa by the window, she rather silent, I chattering, partly to divert her attention from me; & to prevent her thinking “Well, is this all?” as she was bound to think, having declared herself so openly in writing. So that we each registered some disillusionment; & perhaps also acquired some grains of additional solidity—This may well be more lasting than the first rhapsody. But I compared her state, justly, to a flock of birds flying hither thither, escaped, confused: returning, after a long journey, to the middle of things again. She was quieter, shyer, awkwarder than usual even. She has no ready talk confronted by Nelly or Mrs Cartwright she stands like a schoolgirl. I think it quite likely she will get Harold out of his job. But then, as I always feel, with her ‘grand life’, Dotties & so on, whom I don’t know at all, there may be many parts of her perfectly unillumined. But I cannot write. For the most part I can write. Suddenly the word instinct leaves me. This is the permanent state of most people no doubt. Maynard met George & Lady M⁠[argaret]. at the Darwins. He is a humbug & she a fiend, he writes. She now walks with a stick. What a dreary world it is these bubbles meeting once in 20 years or so."
1926.06.09,"Then I got the flue, last Saturday; sat shivering at Lords, in the hot sunshine; so have seen no one, except basement dwellers, & put off Don Giovanni, Dadie & Hope tonight, & Osbert [Sitwell]’s dinner tomorrow. All my bubbling up faculty at once leaves me. I grind out a little of that eternal How to read, lecture, as the Yale Review has bought it, & cannot conceive what The Lighthouse is all about. I hope to whip my brains up either at Vita’s or Rodmell this weekend.

Yes, Rodmell is a perfect triumph, I consider—but L. advises me not to say so. In particular, our large combined drawing eating room, with its 5 windows, its beams down the middle, & flowers & leaves nodding in all round us. The bath boils quickly; the water closets gush & surge (not quite sufficiently though). The weather again failed us, & we had a queer journey home, via Newhaven, Peacehaven & Brighton. Trains slow & scarce. The Strike, I should say, continues. We then went to a party at Edith Sitwell’s (I in my new dress) ‘to meet Miss Stein’, a lady much like Joan Fry, but more massive; in blue-sprinkled brocade, rather formidable. There was Morgan, Siegfried [Sassoon], Todd—to whom I proposed, wildly, fantastically, a book—which she accepts!—(& Viola so much criticised in the austere heights of Ham Spray) & Edith distraught; & cherries in handfulls, & barley water—as L. described it very brilliantly to Sybil the next day. She came: no one else; we sat & laughed—& wheres the harm in this stupidish, kindly, rather amusing woman, I asked? Then she expressed a wish to dine with us. L. is lunching with Wells today."
1926.06.09,"Leonard back from Wells who chattered till ¼ to 4: likes to walk through the streets; has a house in France kept for him by a very intelligent Brazilian lady. Called me “too intelligent—a bad thing”: can’t criticise; brings in social theories, because he says in an age when society is dissolving, the social state is part of the character. They lunched at Boulesteins. Leonard asked for him at the Automobile Club; “A very famous name” said the man. And the warmth & clamour of Wells’ fame seems to reach me, this chilly rainy evening; & I see how, if I stayed there, as he asks us, he would overwhelm me. (We are very hungry, by the way; Nelly is preparing a nice roast chicken & ices for dinner, which I shall enjoy. Then we shall play the Gramophone). I’m cheering up after my attack I’m glad to say, though a little undecided whether to stay with Vita or go to Monks House.

L. is going to make a book of his essays. I think of asking Lady Homer to write her memoirs. Today we discussed the date of Nelly’s holiday—& so we go on."
1926.06.30,"This is the last day of June & finds me in black despair because Clive laughed at my new hat, Vita pitied me, & I sank to the depths of gloom. This happened at Clive’s last night after going to the Sitwells with Vita. Oh dear I was wearing the hat without thinking whether it was good or bad; & it was all very flashing & easy; & there I saw a man with braided hair, another with long red tongues in his button hole; & sat by Vita & laughed & clubbed. When we got out it was only 10.30—a soft starry night: I had refused to go to Colefax: it was still too early for her to go. So she said “Shall we go to Clive’s & pick him up?” & I was then again so lighthearted, driving through the park, & seeing people scud before us. Also we saw all the Mayfair houses, & finally came to Gordon Sqre & there was Nessa tripping along in the dark, in her quiet black hat. So we had some lively talk. She said Duncan was having a sandwich at the public house: then he came, carrying an egg. Come on all of us to Clive’s, I said; & they agreed. Well, it was after they had come & we were all sitting round talking that Clive suddenly said, or bawled rather, what an astonishing hat you’re wearing! Then he asked where I got it. I pretended a mystery, tried to change the talk, was not allowed, & they pulled me down between them, like a hare; I never felt more humiliated. Clive said did Mary choose it? No. Todd said Vita. And the dress? Todd of course: after that I was forced to go on as if nothing terrible had happened; but it was very forced & queer & humiliating. So I talked & laughed too much. Duncan prim & acid as ever told me it was utterly impossible to do anything with a hat like that. And I joked about the Squires’ party. & Leonard got silent, & I came away deeply chagrined, as unhappy as I have been these ten years; & revolved it in sleep & dreams all night; & today has been ruined."
1926.07.01,"These reflections about the hat read rather amusingly I think. What a weathercock of sensibility I am! How I enjoy—or at least how (for I was acutely unhappy & humiliated) these gyrations interest me, conscious as I am of a strong lynch pin controlling them—Leonard in short. Coming out from lunching with Maynard today I ran (in the hat, in the dress) into Clive & Mary, & had to stand their fire: dress praised to the skies, hat passed. So thats over. Indeed the cloud began to lift at 7 last night.

But all this has obscured Garsington; Bridges; & Wells. These great men are so much like the rest of us. Wells remarkable only for a combination of stockishness with acuity: he has a sharp nose, & the cheeks & jowl of a butcher. He likes, I judge, rambling & romancing about the lives of other people; he romanced about the Webbs: said their books were splendid eggs, well & truly laid, but addled. Described Beatrice, as by a gipsy & a Jew: a flashing creature, become Quaker as we all do as we get on. That has nothing to do with (God) Christianity. Are you a Quaker, I asked. Of course I am. One believes that there is a reason for things (I think he said). But he did not rise steadily off the ground for long. Lunch is a hot stodgy hour too. I could see from the plaintive watery look on Mrs Wells’ face (she has widely spaced teeth & in repose looks very worried, at the same time vacant) that he is arrogant lustful & bullying in private life. The virtues he likes are courage & vitality. I said how ghastly! (That is the story of Dorothy Richardson’s struggles.) No: nothing is ghastly where there is courage he said. He rambled over her life, amusingly. How she married Odel, a man who makes symbolical drawings—bubbles coming out of a human mouth & turning into womens legs & so on: which is so like life, Wells said: the heterogeneity—one thing leading to another, & the design so remarkable. But they dont sell. And now Duckworth won’t publish any more of her books.

As for Bridges: he sprang from a rhododendron bush, a very lean tall old man, with a curly grey hat, & a reddish ravaged face, smoky fierce eyes, with a hazy look in them; very active; rather hoarse, talking incessantly. We sat in his open room & looked past blue spikes of flowers to hills, which were invisible, but when they show, all this goes out he said—his one poetical saying, or saying that struck me as such. We talked about handwriting, & criticism; how Garrod had written on Keats; & they know a Petrarchan sonnet, but not why one alters it. Because they dont write sonnets, I suggested, & urged him to write criticism. He is direct & spry, very quick in all his movements, racing me down the garden to look at pinks, then into his library, where he showed me the French critics, then said Michelet was his favourite historian; then I asked to see the Hopkins manuscripts; & sat looking at them with that gigantic grasshopper Aldous folded up in a chair close by. Ottoline undulated & vagulated.

He asked me to come again: would read me his poems—not his early ones which want a beautiful voice, & aren’t interesting he said: but his later ones, his hexameters. He skipped off & held the gate open. I said how much I liked his poems—true of the short ones: but was mainly pleased & gratified to find him so obliging & easy & interested. Ottoline flattered me on this point. But she had her points too; her dwindling charm reveals them, as we sat by the lake, discussing Mary Clive life, truth, literature. Then dressed, & Aldous & Eddie & Philip Nichols, & Miss Spender Clay, who can have £100 a year if she wants it Julian said."
1926.07.04,"Then Wells came again; & stayed till 4, when he had to meet an American. He is getting to the drowsy stage: the 60s. Seems well wishing but not so spry as he used to be. He talked about his new book, the thoughts one has at 60. He brings in everything—a man called Lubin, for instance, who invented intn agriculture (I think) a man who died in poverty & was shuffled out of the way to his grave in Rome the day that Wilson made his entry—“that shallow, pretentious empty headed professor”—Lubin was the real thinker for peace. What other ideas had he? Desmond asked. Well, to do away with Sunday. There should be [a] holiday once in 10 days. That was his own stint. 10 days work, then 4 or 5 days off. The present system is wasteful. The shadow of the week end begins on Friday, is not over till Monday afternoon. He said sometimes he wrote all day for days; sometimes not at all. He struck me again as an odd mixture of bubble & solidity—likes to blow a phrase now & then. We got him on to Hardy—a very simple, subtle old peasant man much impressed by clever people who write⁠[;] very humble, delighted when Wells took Rebecca West to call on him, walked half way into Dorchester with them—“an impudent young journalist” Wells called her. Hardy had heard of her. Came to stay with Barrie to see an air raid—wrote his early books in chapters as the printers wanted them. Then he got up to go: we asked him to stay & tell us about Henry James. So he sat down. Oh I should be delighted to stay & talk the whole afternoon, he said. Henry James was a formalist. He always thought of clothes. He was never intimate with anyone—not with his brother even: had never been in love. Once his brother wanted to see Chesterton, & climbed a ladder & looked over a wall. This angered Henry; who called in Wells & asked him for an opinion—as if I had one! Wells has learnt nothing from Proust—his book like the British Museum. One knows there are delightful interesting things in it, but one does not go there. One day it may be wet—I shall say God, what am I to do this afternoon? & I shall read Proust as I might go to the British Museum. Would not read Richardson—a man who knows all about feminine psychology (with some contempt) nobody ought to know that. I said on the contrary he knew very little: was conventional. Honour, chastity & so on. Wells said we had changed our ideas completely. That idea of chastity had vanished. Women were even more suggestible than men. Now they dont think about it—a chaste little couple (he talks of little couples) mixing with a promiscuous little couple. He said we are happier perhaps—children are certainly more at ease with their parents. But he thought they were beginning to miss restraints. They were wondering what things were for. They were very restless; discussing Henry James & Eliot, & how formal they are & overdone with manner—(he described H.J. pushing under a letter he was writing to talk to Wells “at the Reform”)—I said it was American. They were alien to our civilisation. He said he had been that himself. His father was a gardener, his mother a ladies maid. He found it very strange to meet people who went to parties & wore dress clothes. Henry James could not describe love—there comes the ahh—laying on of hands. This Wells could do himself. I am a journalist. I pride myself upon being a journalist he said. Well I have a sort of feeling that all writing should be journalism—(done with an object)—One knows nothing of what posterity will want—may be a guide book. I tell Arnold [Bennett] they will read him for his topography.

In all this he showed himself, as Desmond said afterwards, perfectly content to be himself, aware of his powers,—aware that he need not take any trouble, since his powers were big enough."
1926.07.22,"The summer hourglass is running out rapidly & rather sandily. Many nights I wake in a shudder thinking of some atrocity of mine. I bring home minute pinpricks which magnify in the middle of the night into gaping wounds. However, I drive my pen through de Quincey of a morning, having put The Lighthouse aside till Rodmell. There all virtue, all good, is in retreat. Here nothing but odds & ends—going to the dentist, buying combs; having Maynard & Bob to tea, & then Ralph & Frances to dinner, followed by Eddie & Kitchen [C. H. B. Kitchin]. But we are both jaded, & get no clear impression any more from the human face—must dine with Osbert Sitwell tonight though, & go to Hardy tomorrow. This is human life: this is the infinitely precious stuff issued in a narrow roll to us now, & then withdrawn for ever; & we spend it thus. Days without definite sensation are the worst of all. Days when one compells oneself to undergo this or that for some reason—but what reason?

There is nothing important at the moment to record: or if so, & one’s state of mind is overwhelmingly important, I leave that, too for Rodmell. There I shall come to grips with the last part of that python, my book; it is a tug & a struggle, & I wonder now & then, why I let myself in for it. Rose Macaulay said “What else would one do with one’s thoughts?” I have not seen her again nor Gwen, nor written to Violet [Dickinson]; nor learnt French, nor finished Clarissa.

Desmond came in; talked about Shakespeare. Now to settle my mind to Suspiria."
1926.07.25,"At first I thought it was Hardy, & it was the parlourmaid, a small thin girl, wearing a proper cap. She came in with silver cake stands & so on. Mrs Hardy talked to us about her dog. How long ought we to stay? Can Mr Hardy walk much &c I asked, making conversation, as I knew one would have to. She has the large sad lack lustre eyes of a childless woman; great docility & readiness, as if she had learnt her part; not great alacrity, but resignation, in welcoming more visitors; wears a sprigged voile dress, black shoes, & a necklace. We cant go far now, she said, though we do walk every day, because our dog isn’t able to walk far. He bites, she told us. She became more natural & animated about the dog, who is evidently the real centre of her thoughts—then the maid came in. Then again the door opened, more sprucely, & in trotted a little puffy cheeked cheerful old man, with an atmosphere cheerful & businesslike in addressing us, rather like an old doctors or solicitors, saying “Well now—” or words like that as he shook hands. He was dressed in rough grey with a striped tie. His nose has a joint in it, & the end curves down. A round whitish face, the eyes now faded & rather watery, but the whole aspect cheerful & vigorous. He sat on a three cornered chair (I am too jaded with all this coming & going to do more than gather facts) at a round table, where there were the cake stands & so on; a chocolate roll; what is called a good tea; but he only drank one cup, sitting on his three cornered chair. He was extremely affable & aware of his duties. He did not let the talk stop or disdain making talk. He talked of father—said he had seen me, or it might have been my sister but he thought it was me, in my cradle. He had been to Hyde Park Place—oh Gate was it. A very quiet street. That was why my father liked it. Odd to think that in all these years he had never been down there again. He went there often. Your father took my novel—Far From the Madding Crowd. We stood shoulder to shoulder against the British public about certain matters dealt with in that novel—You may have heard. Then he said how some other novel had fallen through that was to appear—the parcel had been lost coming from France—not a very likely thing to happen, as your father said—a big parcel of manuscript; & he asked me to send my story. I think he broke all the Cornhill laws—not to see the whole book; so I sent it in chapter by chapter, & was never late. Wonderful what youth is! I had it in my head doubtless, but I never thought twice about it—It came out every month. They were nervous, because of Miss Thackeray I think. She said she became paralysed & could not write a word directly she heard the press begin. I daresay it was bad for a novel to appear like that. One begins to think what is good for the magazine, not what is good for the novel.

You think what makes a strong curtain, put in Mrs Hardy jocularly. She was leaning upon the tea table, not eating gazing out.

Then we talked about manuscripts. Mrs Smith had found the MS of F. from the M.C. in a drawer during the war, & sold it for the Red Cross. Now he has his MSS back, & the printer rubs out all the marks. But he wishes they would leave them, as they prove it genuine.

He puts his head down like some old pouter pigeon. He has a very long head; & quizzical bright eyes, for in talk they grow bright. He said when he was in the Strand 6 years ago he scarcely knew where he was, & he used to know it all intimately. He told us that he used to buy 2nd hand books—nothing valuable—in Wyck Street. Then he wondered why Great James Street should be so narrow & Bedford Row so broad. He had often wondered about that. At this rate, London would soon be unrecognisable. But I shall never go there again. Mrs Hardy tried to persuade him that it was an easy drive—only 6 hours or so. I asked if she liked it, & she said Granville Barker had told her that when she was in the nursing home she had ‘the time of her life’. She knew everyone in Dorchester, but she thought there were more interesting people in London. Had I often been to Siegfried’s flat? I said no. Then she asked about him & Morgan, said he was elusive, as if they enjoyed visits from him. I said I heard from Wells that Mr Hardy had been up to London to see an air raid. “What things they say!” he said. It was my wife. There was an air raid one night when we stayed with Barrie. We just heard a little pop in the distance—The searchlights were beautiful. I thought if a bomb now were to fall on this flat how many writers would be lost. And he smiled in his queer way, which is fresh & yet sarcastic a little: anyhow shrewd. Indeed, there was no trace to my thinking of the simple peasant. He seemed perfectly aware of everything; in no doubt or hesitation; having made up his mind; & being delivered of all his work; so that he was in no doubt about that either. He was not interested much in his novels, or in anybodies novels; took it all easily & naturally. “I never took long with them” he said. The longest was the Dinnasts. (so pronounced). “But that was really 3 books” said Mrs Hardy. Yes: & that took me 6 years; but not working all the time. Can you write poetry regularly? I asked (being beset with the desire to hear him say something about his books); but the dog kept cropping up. How he bit; how the inspector came out; how he was ill; & they could do nothing for him. Would you mind if I let him in? asked Mrs Hardy, & in came We⁠[s]⁠sex, a very tousled, rough brown & white mongrel, got to guard the house, so naturally he bites people, said Mrs H.; Well, I dont know about that, said Hardy, perfectly natural, & not setting much stock by his poems either it seemed. Did you write poems at the same time as your novels? I asked. No. he said. I wrote a great many poems. I used to send them about, but they were always returned, he chuckled. And in those days I believed in editors. Many were lost—all the fair copies were lost. But I found the notes, & I wrote them from those. I was always finding them. I found one the other day; but I don’t think I shall find any more.

Siegfried took rooms near here, & said he was going to work very hard, but he left soon.

E. M. Forster takes a long time to produce anything—7 years, he chuckled. All this made a great impression of the ease with which he did things. “I daresay F. from the M. C. would have been a great deal better if I had written it differently”, he said. But as if it could not be helped, & did not matter.

He used to go to the Lushingtons in Kensington Sqre & saw my mother there. She used to come in & out when I was talking to your father.

I wanted him to say one word about his writing before we left & cd only ask wh. of his books he wd. have chosen, if like me, he had had to choose one to read in the train. I had taken the M⁠[ayor] of C⁠[asterbridge]. That’s being dramatised, put in Mrs H. & then brought L⁠[ove’s], L⁠[ittle]. Ironies.

And did it hold your interest? he asked.

I stammered that I could not stop reading it, which was true, but sounded wrong. Anyhow, he was not going to be drawn, & went off about giving a young lady a wedding present. None of my books are fitted to be wedding presents, he said. You must give Mrs Woolf one of your books, said Mrs Hardy, inevitably. Yes I will. But I’m afraid only in the little thin paper edition, he said. I protested that it would be enough if he wrote his name (then was vaguely uncomfortable).

Then there was de la Mare. His last book of stories seemed to them such a pity. Hardy had liked some of his poems very much. People said he must be a sinister man to write such stories. But he is [a] very nice man—a very nice man indeed.

He said to a friend who begged him not to give up poetry, “I’m afraid poetry is giving up me.” The truth is he is a very kind man, & sees anyone who wants to see him. He has 16 people for the day sometimes.

Do you think one can’t write poetry if one sees people? I asked. “One might be able to—I dont see why not. Its a question of physical strength” said Hardy. But clearly he preferred solitude himself. Always however he said something sensible & sincere; & thus made the obvious business of compliment giving rather unpleasant. He seemed to be free of it all; very active minded; liking to describe people; not to talk in an abstract way: for example Col. Lawrence, bicycling with a broken arm “held like that” from Lincoln to Hardy listened at the door; to hear if there was anyone there.

I hope he won’t commit suicide, said Mrs Hardy pensively, still leaning over the tea cups, gazing despondently. He often says things like it, though he has never said quite that perhaps. But he has blue lines round his eyes. He calls himself Shaw in the army. No one is to know where he is. But it got into the papers.

He promised me (to give up fly—) not to go into the air, said Hardy.

My husband doesn’t like anything to do with the air, said Mrs Hardy. Now we began to look at the grandfather clock in the corner. We said we must go—tried to confess we were only down for the day. I forgot to say that he offered L. whisky & water, wh. struck me that he was competent as a host, & in every way.

So we got up & signed Mrs H’s visitors books; & Hardy took my L. Little Ironies off, & trotted back with it signed, & Woolf spelt Wolff, wh. I daresay had given him some anxiety. Then We⁠[s]⁠sex came in again. I asked if Hardy could stroke him. So he bent down & stroked him, like the master of the house. We⁠[s]⁠sex went on wheezing away.

There was not a trace anywhere of deference to editors, or respect for rank, an extreme simplicity: What impressed me was his freedom, ease, & vitality. He seemed very “Great Victorian” doing the whole thing with a sweep of his hand (they are ordinary smallish, curled up hands) & setting no great stock by literature; but immensely interested in facts; incidents; & somehow, one could imagine, naturally swept off into imagining & creating without a thought of its being difficult or remarkable; becoming obsessed; & living in imagination. Mrs Hardy thrust his old grey hat into his hand & he trotted us out on to the road. Where is that? I asked him, pointing to a clump of trees on the down opposite, for his house is outside the town, with open country (rolling, massive downs, crowned with little tree coronets before & behind) & he said, with interest, “That is Weymouth. We see the lights at night—not the lights themselves, but the reflection of them.” And so we left, & he trotted in again.

Also I asked him if I might see the picture of Tess which Morgan had described, an old picture: whereupon he led me to an awful engraving of Tess coming into a room from a picture by Herkomer, “That was rather my idea of her” he said. But I said I had been told he had an old picture. “Thats fiction” he said. “I used to see people now & then with a look of her.”

———

Also Mrs Hardy said to me, do you know Aldous Huxley? I said I did. They had been reading his book, which she thought ‘very clever’. But Hardy could not remember it. Said his wife had to read to him—his eyes were now so bad. (“Was that the book where the) “Theyve changed everything now he said. We used to think there was a beginning & a middle & an end. We believed in the Aristotelian theory. Now one of those stories came to an end with a woman going out of the room.” He chuckled. But he no longer reads novels.

The whole thing—literature, novels &c—all seemed to him an amusement, far away, too, scarcely to be taken seriously. Yet he had sympathy & pity for those still engaged in it. But what his secret interests & activities are—to what occupation he trotted off when we left him—I do not know.

Small boys write to him from New Zealand, & have to be answered. They bring out a “Hardy number” of a Japanese paper, which he produced. Talked too about Blunden. I think Mrs H. keeps him posted in the doings of the younger poets.

Rodmell. 1926

As I am not going to milk my brains for a week, I shall here write the first pages of the greatest book in the world. This is what the book would be that was made entirely solely & with integrity of one’s thoughts. Suppose one could catch them before they became “works of art.”? Catch them hot & sudden as they rise in the mind—walking up Asheham hill for instance. Of course one cannot; for the process of language is slow & deluding. One must stop to find a word; then, there is the form of the sentence, soliciting one to fill it.

Art & Thought

What I thought was this: if art is based on thought, what is the transmuting process? I was telling myself the story of our visit to the Hardys. & I began to compose it: that is to say to dwell on Mrs Hardy leaning on the table, looking out, apathetically, vaguely; & so would soon bring everything into harmony with that as the dominant theme. But the actual event was different.

Next,

Writing by living people

I scarcely ever read it. but, owing to his giving me the books, am now reading C by M. Baring. I am surprised to find it as good as it is. But how good is it? Easy to say it is not a great book. But what qualities does it lack? That it adds nothing to one’s vision of life, perhaps. Yet it is hard to find a serious flaw. My wonder is that entirely second rate work like this, poured out in profusion by at least 20 people yearly, I suppose, has so much merit. Never reading it, I get into the way of thinking it non-existent. So it is, speaking with the utmost strictness. That is, it will not exist in 2026; but it has some existence now; which puzzles me a little. Now Clarence bores me; yet I feel this is important. And why?"
1926.07.31,"My own Brain

Here is a whole nervous breakdown in miniature. We came on Tuesday. Sank into a chair, could scarcely rise; everything insipid; tasteless, colourless. Enormous desire for rest. Wednesday—only wish to be alone in the open air. Air delicious—avoided speech; could not read. Thought of my own power of writing with veneration, as of something incredible, belonging to someone else; never again to be enjoyed by me. Mind a blank. Slept in my chair. Thursday. No pleasure in life whatsoever; but felt perhaps more attuned to existence. Character & idiosyncracy as Virginia Woolf completely sunk out. Humble & modest. Difficulty in thinking what to say. Read automatically, like a cow chewing cud. Slept in chair. Friday. Sense of physical tiredness; but slight activity of the brain. Beginning to take notice. Making one or two plans. No power of phrase making. Difficulty in writing to Lady Colefax. Saturday (today) much clearer & lighter. Thought I could write, but resisted, or found it impossible. A desire to read poetry set in on Friday. This brings back a sense of my own individuality. Read some Dante & Bridges, without troubling to understand, but got pleasure from them. Now I begin to wish to write notes, but not yet novel. But today senses quickening. No ‘making up’ power yet; no desire to cast scenes in my book. Curiosity about literature returning: want to read Dante, Havelock Ellis, & Berlioz autobiography; also to make a looking glass with shell frame. These processes have sometimes been spread over several weeks.

Proportions Changed

That in the evening, or on colourless days, the proportions of the landscape change suddenly. I saw people playing stoolball in the meadow: they appeared sunk far down on a flat board; & the downs raised high up, & mountainous round them. Detail was smoothed out. This was an extremely beautiful effect; the colours of the womens dresses also showing very bright & pure in the almost untinted surroundings. I knew, also, that the porportions were abnormal—as if I were looking between my legs.

Second Rate Art

i.e. C. by Maurice Baring. Within its limits, it is not second rate, or there is nothing markedly so, at first go off. The limits are the proof of its non-existence.. He can only do one thing: himself to wit; charming, clean, modest sensitive Englishman: outside that radius, & it does not carry far nor illumine much, all is—as it should be; light, sure, proportioned, affecting even; told in so well bred a manner that nothing is exaggerated, all related, proportioned. I could read this for ever, I said. L. said one would soon be sick to death of it.

Wandervögeln

of the sparrow tribe. Two resolute, sunburnt, dusty girls, in jerseys & short skirts, with packs on their backs, city clerks, or secretaries, tramping along the road in the hot sunshine at Ripe. My instinct at once throws up a screen, which condemns them: I think them in every way angular, awkward & self assertive. But all this is a great mistake. These screens shut me out. Have no screens, for screens are made out of our own integument; & get at the thing itself, which has nothing whatever in common with a screen. The screen making habit, though, is so universal, that probably it preserves our sanity. If we had not this device for shutting people off from our sympathies, we might, perhaps, dissolve utterly. Separateness would be impossible. But the screens are in the excess; not the sympathy.

Returning Health

This is shown by the power to make images: the suggestive power of every sight & word is enormously increased. Shakespeare must have had this to an extent which makes my normal state the state of a person blind, deaf, dumb, stone-stockish & fish-blooded. And I have it compared with poor Mrs Bartholomew almost to the extent that Shre has it compared with me."
1926.08.02,"Bank Holiday

Very fat woman, girl & man spend Bank Holiday—a day of complete sun & satisfaction—looking up family graves in the churchyard. 23 youngish men & women spend it tramping along with ugly black boxes on shoulders & arms, taking photographs. Man says to woman “Some of these quiet villages don’t seem to know its bank holiday at all” in a tone of superiority & slight contempt.

The Married Relation

Arnold Bennett says that the horror of marriage lies in its ‘dailiness’. All acuteness of relationship is rubbed away by this. The truth is more like this. Life—say 4 days out of 7—becomes automatic; but on the 5th day a bead of sensation (between husband & wife) forms, wh. is all the fuller & more sensitive because of the automatic customary unconscious days on either side. That is to say the year is marked by moments of great intensity. Hardy’s ‘moments of vision’. How can a relationship endure for any length of time except under these conditions?"
1926.09.03,"Women in tea garden at Bramber—a sweltering hot day: rose trellises; white washed tables; lower middle classes; motor omnibuses constantly passing; bits of grey stone scattered on a paper strewn green sward all thats left of the Castle.

Woman leaning over the table, taking command of the treat, attended by two elder women, whom she pays for, to girl waitress (a marmalade coloured fat girl, with a body like the softest lard, destined soon to marry, but as yet only 16 or so)

Woman “What can we have for tea?”

Girl (very bored, arms akimbo) Cake, bread & butter, tea: Jam?

Woman Have the wasps been troublesome? They get into the jam—as if she suspected the jam would not be worth having.

Girl agrees.

Woman: Ah, wasps have been very prominent this year.

Girl Thats right.

So she doesn’t have jam.

This amused me, I suppose.

For the rest, Charleston, Tilton, To the Lighthouse, Vita, expeditions: the summer dominated by a feeling of washing in boundless warm fresh air—such an August not come my way for years: bicycling; no settled work done, but advantage taken of air for going to the river, or over the downs. The novel is now easily within sight of the end, but this, mysteriously, comes no nearer. I am doing Lily on the lawn: but whether its her last lap, I don’t know. Nor am I sure of the quality; the only certainty seems to be that after tapping my antennae in the air vaguely for an hour every morning I generally write with heat & ease till 12.30: & thus do my two pages."
1926.09.05,"So it will be done, written over that is, in 3 weeks, I forecast, from today. What emerges? At this moment I’m casting about for an end. The problem is how to bring Lily & Mr R⁠[amsay]. together & make a combination of interest at the end. I am feathering about with various ideas. The last chapter which I begin tomorrow is In the Boat: I had meant to end with R. climbing on to the rock. If so, what becomes [of] Lily & her picture? Should there be a final page about her & Carmichael looking at the picture & summing up R.’s character? In that case I lose the intensity of the moment. If this intervenes, between R. & the lighthouse, there’s too much chop & change, I think. Could I do it in a parenthesis? so that one had the sense of reading the two things at the same time?

I shall solve it somehow, I suppose. Then I must go in to the question of quality. I think it may run too fast & free, & so be rather thin. On the other hand, I think it is subtler & more human than J⁠[acob’s] R⁠[oom] & Mrs D⁠[alloway]. And I am encouraged by my own abundance as I write. It is proved, I think, that what I have to say is to be said in this manner. As usual, side stories are sprouting in great variety as I wind this up: a book of characters; the whole string being pulled out from some simple sentence, like Clara Pater’s, “Don’t you find that Barker’s pins have no points to them?” I think I can spin out all their entrails this way; but it is hopelessly undramatic. It is all in oratio obliqua. Not quite all; for I have a few direct sentences. The lyric portions of To the L. are collected in the 10 year lapse, & dont interfere with the text so much as usual. I feel as if it fetched its circle pretty completely this time: & I dont feel sure what the stock criticism will be. Sentimental? Victorian?

Then I must begin to plan out my book on literature for the Press. Six chapters. Why not groups of ideas, under some single heading—for example. Symbolism. God. Nature. Plot. Dialogue. Take a novel & see what the component parts are. Separate this, & bring under them instances of all the books which display them biggest. Probably this would pan out historically. One could spin a theory which wd bring the chapters together. I don’t feel that I can read seriously⁠[?] & exactly for it. Rather I want to sort out all the ideas that have accumulated in me.

Then I want to write a bunch of ‘Outlines’ to make money (for under a new arrangement, we’re to share any money over £200 that I make): this I must leave rather to chance, according to what books come my way. I am frightfully contented these last few days, by the way. I dont quite understand it. Perhaps reason has something to do with it. Charleston & Tilton knocked me off my perch for a moment: Nessa & her children: Maynard & his carpets. My own gifts & shares seemed so moderate in comparison; my own fault too—a little more self control on my part, & we might have had a boy of 12, a girl of 10: This always rakes me wretched in the early hours. So I said, I am spoiling what I have. And thereupon settled [?] to exploit my own possessions to the full; I can make money & buy carpets; I can increase the pleasure of life enormously by living it carefully. No doubt, this is a rationalisation of a state which is not really of that nature. Probably I am very lucky. Mrs Allinson says she would like to look like me. Mary says I’m the only woman she loves. Nelly cooks admirably. Then, I am extremely happy walking on the downs. I dont want to be talking to Eddy at Charleston. I like to have space to spread my mind out in. Whatever I think, I can rap out, suddenly to L. We are somehow very detached, free, harmonious. I don’t in the least want to hurry up & finish the time here. I want to go to Seaford & walk back over the downs; to go & see the house at East Chiltington; to breathe in more light & air; to see more grey hollows & gold cornfields & the first ploughed land shining white, with the gulls flickering. No: I dont want anyone to come here & interrupt. I am immensely busy. Hence I come to my moral, which is simply to enjoy what one does enjoy, without teasing oneself oh but Nessa has children, Maynard carpets. I might go & stay with Ethel [Sands, in Normandy]. For my own wishes are always definite enough to give me a lead, one way or another; & the chief joy in life is to follow these lights; I am now almost entirely surrounded by sheep. God knows, I wish we could buy the terrace, & have a garden all round the lodge—but this is not a serious diminution of joy.

Clive & Mary came over yesterday in brilliant sun. We sat on the millstones, (one sheep has a tail like a bell-rope—the others are all bit short.) Wells. Hardy. Maynard. Richardson, [word illegible]. Christabel—going to Greece for a month with Lesley Jowitt. Maupassant’s metaphors—The Questionnaire. Lytton’s harem—Their dulness—Carrington a cook who doesn’t go out on Sundays. Whether Eddy is clever or not. Tonks & Steer & Moore—Tonks in love with Mary, Clive insists; she is modest. So we talked. Then I drove with them to the Laye, walked up the down behind Asheham & let all that wind & sun blow through the crazy sails of my old windmill, which gives me so much pleasure still. I forget what I thought about: did not think, I suppose; was all in a thrill of emotion at my being liked by Mary & being a success, &c. Home to music, my new 15/- table, talk with L.: a sense of great happiness & ease. Went & looked at the stars, but could not get quite the right sense of amazement (I can get this really well at times) because L. said

“Now come in. Its too cold to be out”"
1926.09.13,"The blessed thing is coming to an [end] I say to myself with a groan. Its like some prolonged rather painful & yet exciting process of nature, which one desires inexpressibly to have over. Oh the relief of waking & thinking its done—the relief, & the disappointment, I suppose. I am talking of To the Lighthouse. I am exacerbated by the fact that I spent 4 days last week hammering out de Quincey, which has been lying about since June; so refused £30 to write on Willa Cather; & now shall be quit in a week I hope of this unprofitable fiction, & could have wedged in Willa before going back. So I should have had £70 of my years 200 ready made by October: (my greed is immense: I want to have £50 of my own in the Bank to buy Persian carpets, pots, chairs &c.) Curse Richmond, Curse The Times, Curse my own procrastinations & nerves. I shall do Cobden Sanderson & Mrs Hemans & make something by them however. As for the book [To the Lighthouse]—Morgan said he felt ‘This is a failure’ as he finished The passage to India. I feel—what? A little stale this last week or two from steady writing. But also a little triumphant. If my feeling is correct, this is the greatest stretch I’ve put my method to, & I think it holds. By this I mean that I have been dredging up more feelings & character, I imagine. But Lord knows, until I look at my haul. This is only my own feeling in process. Odd how I’m haunted by that damned criticism of Janet Case’s “its all dressing … technique. (Mrs Dalloway). The C.R. has substance”. But then in ones strained state any fly has liberty to settle, & its always the gadflies. Muir praising me intelligently has comparatively little power to encourage—when I’m working that is—when the ideas halt. And this last lap, in the boat, is hard, because the material is not so rich as it is with Lily on the lawn: I am forced to be more direct & more intense. I am making some use of symbolism, I observe; & I go in dread of ‘sentimentality’. Is the whole theme open to that charge? But I doubt that any theme is in itself good or bad. It gives a chance to ones peculiar qualities—thats all. Then I’m concerned whether to stay with Ethel Sands or not: whether to buy a dress or not. Then I’m astonishingly happy in the country—a state of mind which, if I did not dislike hyphens, I should hyphen, to show that it is a state by itself.

We took Angus over the downs towards Falmer yesterday. After all these years, we have discovered some of the loveliest, loneliest, most surprising downland in these parts: lovelier I think than our rival the Seaford-Tilton down over which we walked in broiling sun last Thursday. How it beat on our heads, made poor puppy pant. Lydia & Maynard came to tea."
1926.09.15,"Sometimes I shall use the Note form: for instance this

A State of Mind

Woke up perhaps at 3. Oh its beginning its coming—the horror—physically like a painful wave swelling about the heart—tossing me up. I’m unhappy unhappy! Down—God, I wish I were dead. Pause. But why am I feeling this? Let me watch the wave rise. I watch. Vanessa. Children. Failure. Yes; I detect that. Failure failure. (The wave rises). Oh they laughed at my taste in green paint! Wave crashes. I wish I were dead! I’ve only a few years to live I hope. I cant face this horror any more—(this is the wave spreading out over me).

This goes on; several times, with varieties of horror. Then, at the crisis, instead of the pain remaining intense, it becomes rather vague. I doze. I wake with a start. The wave again! The irrational pain: the sense of failure; generally some specific incident, as for example my taste in green paint, or buying a new dress, or asking Dadie for the week end, tacked on.

At last I say, watching as dispassionately as I can, Now take a pull of yourself. No more of this. I reason. I take a census of happy people & unhappy. I brace myself to shove to throw to batter down. I begin to march blindly forward. I feel obstacles go down. I say it doesn’t matter. Nothing matters. I become rigid & straight, & sleep again, & half wake & feel the wave beginning & watch the light whitening & wonder how, this time, breakfast & daylight will overcome it; & then hear L. in the passage & simulate, for myself as well as for him, great cheerfulness; & generally am cheerful, by the time breakfast is over. Does everyone go through this state? Why have I so little control? It is not creditable, nor lovable. It is the cause of much waste & pain in my life."
1926.09.28,"Every day I have meant to record a state of mind. But it has always disappeared (characteristically) yet recurred often enough to make it one of some importance. It is raining hard this evening; we have entered the calm period of Nelly’s departure. So I will try, before my fingers chill & my mind wanders to the fire, to write here what I can remember.

Intense depression: I have to confess that this has overcome me several times since September 6th (I think that, or thereabouts was the date.) It is so strange to me that I cannot get it right—the depression, I mean, which does not come from something definite, but from nothing. “Where there is nothing” the phrase came (back) to me, as I sat at the table in the drawing room. Of course I was interested; & discovered that, for the first time for many years, I had been idle without being ill. We had been walking, expeditioning, in the hot fine weather. I was writing the last pages of To the Lighthouse (finished, provisionally, Sept 16th). Somehow, my reading had lapsed. I was hunting no hares. One night I got hold of Geoffrey Scott’s book on Architecture, & a little spark of motive power awoke in me. This is a warning then; never to cease the use of the brain. So I used my brain. Then, owing to mismanagement, no one came to stay, & I got very few letters; & the high pure hot days went on & on; & this blankness persisted, & I began to suspect my book of the same thing; & there was Nessa humming & booming & flourishing over the hill; & one night we had a long long argument. Vita started it, by coming over with Plank, & L. (I say) spoilt the visit by glooming because I said he had been angry. He shut up, & was caustic. He denied this, but admitted that my habits of describing him, & others, had this effect often. I saw myself, my brilliancy, genius, charm, beauty (&c. Seethe attendants who float me through so many years) diminish & disappear. One is in truth rather an elderly dowdy fussy ugly incompetent woman vain, chattering & futile. I saw this vividly, impressively. Then he said our relations had not been so good lately. On analysing my state of mind I admitted that I had been irritated, first by the prevalency of the dogs (Grizzle on heat too.) Secondly by his assumption that we can afford to saddle ourselves with a whole time gardener, build or buy him a cottage, & take in the terrace to be garden. Then, I said, we shall be tying ourselves to come here; shall never travel; & it will be assumed that Monks House is the hub of the world. This it certainly is not, I said, to me; nor do I wish to spend such a measure of our money on gardens, when we cannot buy rugs, beds or good arm chairs. L. was, I think, hurt at this, & I was annoyed at saying it, yet did it, not angrily, but in the interests of freedom. Too many women give way on this point, & secretly grudge their unselfishness in silence—a bad atmosphere. Our atmosphere decidedly cleared, after this, Tommie [Tomlin] came for the week end, & I am once more full of work, at high pressure, interested, & quite unable, I see, to make plain even to my own eyes, my season of profound despondency.

If I wish to avoid this in future, I recommend, first, incessant brain activity; reading, & planning; second, a methodical system of inviting people here (which is possible, with Nelly obedient & gay); third, increased mobility. For next year, I shall arrange perhaps to go definitely to Ethel Sands. With my motor I shall be more mobile.

But it is always a question whether I wish to avoid these glooms. In part they are the result of getting away by oneself, & have a psychological interest which the usual state of working & enjoying lacks. These 9 weeks give one a plunge into deep waters; which is a little alarming, but full of interest. All the rest of the year one’s (I daresay rightly) curbing & controlling this odd immeasurable soul. When it expands, though one is frightened & bored & gloomy, it is as I say to myself, awfully queer. There is an edge to it which I feel of great importance, once in a way. One goes down into the well & nothing protects one from the assault of truth. Down there I cant write or read; I exist however. I am. Then I ask myself what I am? & get a closer though less flattering answer than I should on the surface—where, to tell the truth, I get more praise than is right. But the praise will go; one will be left alone with this queer being in old age. I am glad to find it on the whole so interesting, though so acutely unpleasant. Also, I can, by taking pains, be much more considerate of L.’s feelings; & so keep more steadily at our ordinary level of intimacy & ease: a level, I think, no other couple so long married, reaches, & keeps so constantly."
1926.09.30,"I wished to add some remarks to this, on the mystical side of this solitude; how it is not oneself but something in the universe that one’s left with. It is this that is frightening & exciting in the midst of my profound gloom, depression, boredom, whatever it is: One sees a fin passing far out. What image can I reach to convey what I mean? Really there is none I think. The interesting thing is that in all my feeling & thinking I have never come up against this before. Life is, soberly & accurately, the oddest affair; has in it the essence of reality. I used to feel this as a child—couldn’t step across a puddle once I remember, for thinking, how strange—what am I? &c. But by writing I dont reach anything. All I mean to make is a note of a curious state of mind. I hazard the guess that it may be the impulse behind another book. At present my mind is totally blank & virgin of books* * Perhaps The Waves or moths (Oct. 1929) I want to watch & see how the idea at first occurs. I want to trace my own process.

I was depressed again today because Vita did not come (yet relieved at the same time); had to hold L.’s ladder in the garden, when I wanted to write or to try on Nessa’s dress; & slightly afraid that this dress is not very successful.

But I am shelving the dress problem on these principles. I am having cheap day clothes; & a good dress from Brooke; & I am being less pernickety about keeping to limits, as I have only to write & stir myself, to make, I wager, quite £50 extra in the year for my own extravagances. No longer shall I let a coat for £3 floor me in the middle of the night, or be afraid to lunch out because “I’ve no clothes.” A broader & bolder grasp is what is wanted. Here I am going into the question of order & so on, like a housekeeper, taking in supplies. Soon, this time next week, I shall have no time for glooming or introspection. It will be “When may I come & see you?” Already Betty Potter has begun.

Now I must scheme a little at my book of criticism."
1926.10.30,"It will be when may I come & see you I—too true a prophecy, though made in the damp & solitude of Rodmell. Monday, Ozzie Dickinson, Wednesday, Lady Colefax, Thursday Morgan to meet Abel Chevalley, dine Wells to meet Arnold Bennett, Friday to Monday Long Barn. So the week slips or sticks through my fingers; rage misery joy, dulness elation mix: I am the usual battlefield of emotions; alternately think of buying chairs & clothes; plod with some method revising To the Lighthouse; quarrel with Nelly (who was to catch the afternoon train today because I told a lie about a telephone) & so we go on. Maurice Baring & the Sitwells send me their books; Leonard forges ahead, now doing what he calls “correspondence”; the Press creaks a little at its hinges; Mrs C⁠[artwright]. has absconded with my spectacles: I find Buggers bores; like the normal male; & should now be developing my book for the Press. All these things shoulder each other out across the screen of my brain. At intervals, I begin to think (I note this, as I am going to watch for the advent of a book) of a solitary woman musing⁠[?] a book of ideas about life. This has intruded only once or twice, & very vaguely: it is a dramatisation of my mood at Rodmell. It is to be an endeavour at something mystic, spiritual; the thing that exists when we aren’t there.

Among external things, we were at Cambridge for the week end; kept warm at the Bull—& there’s a good subject—The Hotel. Many people from Macclesfield talking about motor cars. Mothers, to me pathetic, looking half shyly at their sons, as if deprecating their age. A whole life opened to me: father, mother, son, daughter. Father alone has wine. An enormous man, like an advertisement of Power: sits in chair. Daddy you’ll be miserable in it says girl, herself bovine. Mother a mere wisp; sits with eyes shut; had spent hours driving up writing characters of maids. Shall I remember any of this?

Then Gosse introducing Vita at Royal —— something. I never saw the whole hierarchy of lit. so plainly exposed. Gosse the ornament on the tea pot: beneath him file on file of old stout widows whose husbands had been professors, beetle specialists doubtless, meritorious dons; & these good people, ruminating tea, & reflecting all the depths of the suburbs tinctured with literature, dear Vita told them were “The Hollow Men.” Her address was read in sad sulky tones like those of a schoolboy; her pendulous rich society face, glowing out under a black hat at the end of the smoky dismal room, looked very ancestral & like a picture under glass in a gallery. She was fawned upon by the little dapper grocer Gosse, who kept spinning round on his heel to address her compliments & to scarify Bolshevists; in an ironical voice which seemed to ward off what might be said of him; & to be drawing round the lot of them thicker & thicker, the red plush curtains of respectability. There was Vita, who was too innocent to see it, Guedalla, & Drinkwater. I dont regret my wildest, foolishest, utterance, if it gave the least crack to this respectability. But needless to say, no word of mine has had any effect whatever. Gosse will survive us all. Now how does he do it? Yet he seemed to me, with his irony & his scraping, somehow uneasy. A kind of black doormat got up & appeared to be Lady Gosse. So home, with Dotty in a rage, because she was palmed off with Plank. She did contrive to get here though in the end. One night I went in with Vita after the play. She was lying asleep at Mount Street, in a flat at the top of the house: large pale furniture about dimly seen—a dog on her bed. She woke up chattering & hysterical. Virginia Woolf Virginia Woolf My God! Virginia Woolf is in the room. For Gods Sake Vita dont turn the lights on. No light you fool! But I cant see to get the allella, mumbled Vita. She got it though. We sat & drank. Dusky shapes of glasses & things, a room I had never seen; a woman I scarcely knew; Vita there between us, intimate wi’ both; flattery, extravagance, complete inner composure on my part, & so home."
1926.11.23,"Here I must resolve first of all to find some long solid book to read. What? Tristram Shandy? French memoirs? This is on top of a discussion, at tea about Angus. He dont do, L. says: will never make a manager. So then shall it be another attempt, or Cape, or Seeker? These difficulties recur. I should not much like writing for Cape; yet if the Press is sagging on our shoulders, there is little sense in waiting on. Next year L. thinks we could sell to advantage. It gives one a full life: but then life is so full already. Colefax complicates the scene—Colefax is the death of this book. Aren’t I always reading her scrawls or answering them. This culminated last week in her dining alone with me, off cold chicken. I found us talking socially, not intimately, she in pearls (shams Vita says) popping up one light after another: like the switch board at the telephone exchange at the mention of names. Geoffrey Scott, Percy Lubbock⁠[,] whoever it might be. Perfectly competent, &, for her purpose, efficient. She is, I maintain, a woman of the world: has all her senses tuned to that pitch. The machine doesn’t work in private, though she was very anxious, poor aspiring, slightly suspicious & uneasy woman, that it should. She told me how she had lived till she married running after old ladies with their knitting. So, on marriage, but she was only 19, had kicked her heels up: determined to live, like Violet’s mother, who leant out of the Palace window at Auckland & said, to an old man selling kippers, Is this life? But now, aged 50, she asks, Is this life? again—rushing round, dining & giving dinners; never able to concentrate in a corner, & secretly, in my opinion, not desiring it but pretending it, as she has the habit of pretence. This is all right in her, but wrong in me. So we don’t altogether amalgamate; but I have my reservations, she hers. In came Dadie, to our relief, somewhat; then Sir Arthur, breezy, cheery, competent, patting her, controlling her, petted by her (she reverted to her arch girlish days, when she could eat soup & potatoes without any thought of her figure) sitting on the edge of my shabby dirty down at heels arm chair.

All this rushes on apace. Fame grows. Chances of meeting this person, doing that thing, accumulate. Life is as I’ve said since I was 10, awfully interesting—if anything, quicker, keener at 44 than 24—more desperate I suppose, as the river shoots to Niagara—my new vision of death; active, positive, like all the rest, exciting; & of great importance—as an experience.

‘The one experience I shall never describe’ I said to Vita yesterday. She was sitting on the floor in her velvet jacket & red striped silk shirt, I knotting her pearls into heaps of great lustrous eggs. She had come up to see me—so we go on—a spirited, creditable affair, I think, innocent (spiritually) & all gain, I think; rather a bore for Leonard, but not enought to worry him. The truth is one has room for a good many relationships. Then she goes back again to Persia, with Leigh Ashton—that putty faced low voiced rather beaten cur, who is always slinking off with his tail between his legs, but gives, they say, oyster suppers.

I am re-doing six pages of Lighthouse daily. This is not I think, so quick as Mrs D.: but then I find much of it very sketchy, & have to improvise on the typewriter. This I find much easier than re-writing in pen & ink. My present opinion is that it is easily the best of my books, fuller than J.’s R. & less spasmodic, occupied with more interesting things than Mrs D. & not complicated with all that desperate accompaniment of madness. It is freer & subtler I think. Yet I have no idea yet of any other to follow it: which may mean that I have made my method perfect, & it will now stay like this, & serve whatever use I wish to put it to. Before, some development of the method brought fresh subjects in view, because I saw the chance of being able to say them. Yet I am now & then haunted by some semi mystic very profound life of a woman, which shall all be told on one occasion; & time shall be utterly obliterated; future shall somehow blossom out of the past. One incident—say the fall of a flower—might contain it. My theory being that the actual event practically does not exist—nor time either. But I dont want to force this. I must make up my Series book."
1926.12.12,"I have never been able to afford 2/ for a good piece of washleather, yet I buy a dozen boxes of matches for 1/6.

I am giving up the hope of being well dressed.

Violet Dickinson has just had a third serious operation & I went to an old Curiosity shop instead of going to see her.

Leonard is lunching with Maynard & a great registered parcel has just been delivered containing Dadie’s dissertation.

It is now close on 3.30.

Some superstition prevents me from reading Yeats’ autobiography as I should like.

I am very happy at the moment: having arranged my week on the whole well.

But I have been rather unscupulous. I have put off the Stephens, at Thorpe: & shall probably stay at Knole.

A few thoughts to fill up time waiting for dinner.

An article all about London:

How Vita’s inkpot flowered on her table.

Logan’s vanity: I write everything 8 times—

(So thats how its done I thought: he thought thats the only way to produce writing like mine)

But all my thoughts perish instantly. I make them up so vast. How to blunt the sting of an unpleasant remark: to say it over & over & over again. Walked to Violet’s; took her a red carnation & a white one. My feelings quickened as I drew near. I visualised the operation as I stood on the doorstep.

I also have made up a passage for The Lighthouse: on people going away & the effect on one’s feeling for them.

But reading Yeats turns my sentences one way: reading Sterne turns them another."
1927.01.14,"This is out of order, but I have no new book, & so must record here (& it was here I recorded the beginning of The Lighthouse) must record here the end. This moment I have finished the final drudgery. It is now complete for Leonard to read on Monday. Thus I have done it some days under the year, & feel thankful to be out of it again. Since October 25th I have been revising & retyping (some parts 3 times over) & no doubt I should work at it again; but I cannot. What I feel is that it is a hard muscular book, which at this age proves that I have something in me. It has not run out & gone flabby, at least such is my feeling before reading it over."
1927.01.23,"Well Leonard has read To the Lighthouse, & says it is much my best book, & it is a ‘masterpiece’. He said this without my asking. I came back from Knole & sat without asking him. He calls it entirely new ‘a psychological poem’, is his name for it. An improvement upon Dalloway: more interesting. Having won this great relief, my mind dismisses the whole thing, as usual; & I forget it, & shall only wake up & be worried again over proofs & then when it appears.

We went to Cornwall (dare I characterise Will hearing him talk next door—it is Sunday—he is dining with us). He is a water-blooded waspish little man, all on edge, vain, peevish, nervous. Ka is matronly, but substantial. Some views I retain—one of the valley in the evening light—but others were only a dull impression of life suspended & frozen, & the chin sawing of Mervyn: all chapped, becolded. We came home for these reasons a day early, & next morning I had a letter from the New York H⁠[erald]. & T⁠[ribune] asking me to go there, passage paid, 120 in my pocket &, perhaps, expenses, & write 4 articles. We accepted, on conditions; but have not heard yet. Meanwhile we hesitate, for if Leonard came, we should probably be £150 out of pocket. So it seems. The adventure is tempting. But the grind of moneymaking is scarcely to be endured unnecessarily. We could go to Greece, or Italy for less.

Then Nessa has gone, poor dear creature. I came in two days ago & found her white at the telephone; Elly at the other end saying that Duncan’s illness was probably typhoid. I think a left handed marriage makes these moments more devastating: a sense remains, I think of hiding one’s anguish; of insecurity. Angus writes the most cautious alarming letters. Anyhow she went yesterday in a snowstorm, & we kissed on the pavement in the snow. We are very intimate—a great solace to me. Vita goes on Saturday. Tomorrow I dine with her at Colefaxes: a brilliant party: no clothes: hair down my back as usual. Does it very much matter? I reached that point of philosophy at Knole the other night, with the bountiful womanly Mrs Rubens & his Lordship the figure of an English nobleman, decayed, dignified, smoothed, effete; respectable I think in his modest way. But I never have enjoyed a party. Balls at Buckingham Palace are worth looking at. He spends the day sitting on Com⁠[mi]⁠tees at Maidstone; interviews parsons about livings; likes chess & crime. Vita took me over the 4 acres of building, which she loves: too little conscious beauty for my taste: smallish rooms looking on to buildings: no views: yet one or two things remain: Vita stalking in her Turkish dress, attended by small boys, down the gallery, wafting them on like some tall sailing ship—a sort of covey of noble English life: dogs walloping, children crowding, all very free & stately: & [a] cart bringing wood in to be sawn by the great circular saw. How do you see that? I asked Vita. She said she saw it as something that had gone on for hundreds of years. They had brought wood in from the Park to replenish the great fires like this for centuries: & her ancestresses had walked so on the snow with their great dogs bounding by them. All the centuries seemed lit up, the past expressive, articulate; not dumb & forgotten; but a crowd of people stood behind, not dead at all; not remarkable; fair faced, long limbed; affable; & so we reach the days of Elizabeth quite easily. After tea, looking for letters of Dryden’s to show me, she tumbled out a love letter of Ld Dorset’s (17th century) with a lock of his soft gold tinted hair which I held in my hand a moment. One had a sense of links fished up into the light which are usually submerged. Otherwise no particular awe or any great sense of difference or distinction. They are not a brilliant race. The space & comeliness of it all struck me. I came home to Marjorie Strachey, Tom Eliot, Nessa & Roger. A little constricted our society: no talk of the clergy or of the country; but how lively & agile compared with the

DIARY XVI"
1927.02.03,"Fate always contrives that I begin the new year in February. I ask, why another volume? (but here’s an innovation: this is not a book but a block—so lazy am I about making writing books nowadays). What is the purpose of them? L. taking up a volume the other day said Lord save him if I died first & he had to read through these. My handwriting deteriorates. And do I say anything interesting? I can always waste an idle hour reading them; & then, oh yes, I shall write my memoirs out of them, one of these days.

That reminds me of the Webbs: those 36 strenuous hours at Liphook, in an emphatic lodging house, with blue books in the passages; & those entirely devoted—by which I mean those entirely integrated people. Their secret is that they have by nature no divisions of soul to fritter them away: their impact is solid & entire. Without eyes & ears (but Mrs Webb listens in & prefers Mozart to Handel, if I may guess) one can come down with more of a weight upon bread & butter or whatever the substance is before one. On a steely watery morning we swiftly tramped over a heathy common talking, talking. In their efficiency & glibness one traces perfectly adjusted machinery; but talk by machinery does not charm, or suggest: it cuts the grass of the mind close at the roots. I’m too hurried to write. Mrs W. is far less ornamental than of old: wispy untidy drab, with a stain on her skirt & a key on her watch chain; as if she had cleared the decks & rolled her sleeves & was waiting for the end, but working."
1927.02.12,"Exactly what has happened in the Clive Mary affair I cannot say. Did he not sheepishly admit in the kitchen the other night that he was putting it off till March? & then, casually & jauntily tell me as if by chance, the other afternoon, here, that he was going after all. But wont Mary mind? What if she does?—that was practically his answer.

Vita’s prose is too fluent. I’ve been reading it, & it makes my pen run. When I’ve read a classic, I am curbed &—not castrated: no, the opposite; I cant think of the word at the moment.

Had I been writing P⁠[assenger] to T⁠[eheran] I should have run off whole pools of this coloured water; & then (I think) found my own method of attack. It is my distinction as a writer I think to get this clear & my expression exact. Were I writing travels I should wait till some angle emerged: & go for that. The method of writing smooth narrative cant be right; things dont happen in one’s mind like that. But she is very skilful & golden voiced.

This makes me think that I have to read To the L. tomorrow & Monday, straight through in print; straight through, owing to my curious methods, for the first time. I want to read largely & freely once: then to niggle over details.

But I am forgetting, after 3 days, the most important event in my life since marriage—so Clive described it: Bobo shingled me. Mr Cizec has bingled me. I am short haired for life. Having no longer, I think, any claims to beauty, the convenience of this alone makes it desirable. Every morning I go to take up brush & twist that old coil round my finger & fix it with hairpins & then with a start of joy, no I needn’t. In front there is no change; behind I’m like the rump of a partridge. This robs dining out of half its terrors; in token of which, I’m ‘dining out’ (the distinction is clear: Roger & Clive & Bloomsbury aint dining out) with Ethel [Sands] & with the [Hubert] Hendersons.

For the rest—its been a gay tropical kind of autumn, with so much Vita & Knole & staying away: we have launched ourselves a little more freely perhaps from work & the Press. But now with Nessa away, Clive away, Duncan away, Vita away, the strenuous time sets in: I’m reading & writing at a great pace; mean to ‘do’ Morgan; have a fling at my book on fiction; & make all the money we want for Greece & a motor car. I may note that the first symptoms of Lighthouse are unfavourable. Roger, it is clear did not like Time Passes. Harpers & the Forum have refused serial rights; Brace writes, I think, a good deal less enthusiastically than of Mrs D. But these opinions refer to the rough copy, unrevised. And anyhow I feel callous: L.’s opinion keeps me steady; I’m neither one thing nor the other.

Yesterday Wells asked us to publish a pamphlet for him. This is a great rise in the world for us; & comes on top of rather a flat talk with Angus. L. says he doesn’t “manage”. Angus refuses to budge an inch. He can’t see the point of it. As he says, too, whats he to do if he leaves? He doesn’t want to leave. Though sometimes ‘fed up’ he likes it better than most work. But I’m persuaded we need, the press needs, a fanatic at the moment; not this quiet easygoing gentlemanliness. I am annoyed at doing cards, & envelopes; & L. does twice the work I do."
1927.02.21,"Why not invent a new kind of play—as for instance

Woman thinks:…

He does.

Organ Plays.

She writes.

They say:

She sings:

Night speaks:

They miss

I think it must be something in this line—though I cant now see what. Away from facts: free; yet concentrated; prose yet poetry; a novel & a play.

But today is"
1927.02.28,"& I have got into another stream of thought, if thought it can be called.

Let me collect a few logs, drifting in my mind, to represent the past few days.

Clive, standing at the door.

She cries for the moon.

This was said of Mary. With it he went to Cassis for 3 months.

Again, If Mrs Woolf dont think me worth a penny stamp I said—this being Rose Bartholomew standing at her cottage door on Friday evening. Phrases suddenly seem to me very significant, & then I forget them. My brain is rather stale. Do I like The Lighthouse? I think I was disappointed. But God knows. I have to read it again.

A letter from Vita & Dottie just come. She is not an explicit letter writer. But I must be fond of her, genuinely, to start as I did at the sight of Dottie’s hand, thinking she wrote to say V. was ill.

For the rest I think Cowper is a good poet. I’d like to write about him. Shall we go to Greece, Italy or France? I’m glad I didn’t dedicate my book to Roger. This I verified in his presence, the other night [23 February]. He dined here with Raymond. Raymond is intellectually speaking underbred. Roger a pure aristocrat. Philip [Ritchie] came in, his little green eyes hazed bunged up with drink. So to Rodmell. And now the wind is making the tin screen over the gas fire rattle. How we protect ourselves from the elements! Coming back last night I thought, owing to civilisation, I, who am now cold, wet, & hungry, can be warm & satisfied & listening to a Mozart 4tet in 15 minutes. And so I was.

That ring may be Tom. No. Tom dont run upstairs—only the lower classes do that.

And I dont think I shall go out in the rain, though I am going to spend this week in long romantic London walks. I have successfully broken the neck of that screaming grey goose—society. There’s nothing to be afraid of in dining with Ethel or Sibyl—& I’m shingled now. One spins round for a moment & then settles on one’s feet. But about the Soul: the soul has sunk to the bottom. I am empty headed tonight, feeling the lack of Nessa rather, & all the prelude of Spring—the vague discomfort & melancholy & a feeling of having come to anchor. But I intend to work harder & harder. If they—the respectables, my friends, advise me against The Lighthouse, I shall write memoirs; have a plan already to get historical manuscripts & write Lives of the Obscure: but why do I pretend I should take advice? After a holiday the old ideas will come to me as usual; seeming fresher, more important than ever; & I shall be off again, feeling that extraordinary exhilaration, that ardour & lust of creation—which is odd, if what I create is, as it well may be, wholly bad.

Today I bought a new watch. Last night I crept into L.’s bed to make up a sham quarrel about paying our fares to Rodmell. Now to finish Passage to India."
1927.03.05,"Both rather headachy & fatigued. This is the last slope up of the year which is always worst. Finishing, correcting the last proofs that is to say, of a book is always a screw. Then I have written rather incessantly, one thing after another. A holiday, without dinner to order, or telephone to answer, or people to talk to, will be a divine miracle. We go to Cassis on the 30th; then to Sicily; so home by Rome. What could be more to my heart. Often I sit & think of looking at things. The greed of my eye is insatiable. To think of seeing a new place fills me with excitement. I now make up pictures of Sicily. Think of the Campagna grey in the evening.

I have been hard pressed about the Eliot fund, & behind the scenes of ladies diplomacy—Chrissie & Sibyl, that is: so much suavity, so much distrust of each other, & so great a desire for compliments. Molly came to tea; could not get her mind off her troubles, first laughing at them—Desmond all right, & so on: then brushing laughter aside, & becoming more & more openly worried. Sibyl had cross examined her about her debts. To such indignities poverty exposes one. So I told her the truth, or what I hope will be the truth: that friends are subscribing enough to send them abroad, Oh how wonderful! she exclaimed, she never having seen Italy or Spain all these years. “I’m afraid Desmond has had rather an unhappy life,” she said. “But then think of Lytton … Of course I was extravagant about doing the house up … but then we can let it.” “Rachel goes for long walks at night & reads Coleridge—Oh Desmond’s hopeless—he’s like a dog who runs out if the door is open.” So we laid our heads together over the fire; & felt very sisterly & sympathetic. I distrust though the pleasure one gets in helping one’s friends."
1927.03.14,"Although annoyed that I have not heard from Vita by this post nor yet last week, annoyed sentimentally, & partly from vanity—still I must record the conception last night between 12 & one of a new book. I said I would be on the watch for symptoms of this extremely mysterious process. For some weeks, since finishing The Lighthouse I have thought myself virgin, passive, blank of ideas. I toyed vaguely with some thoughts of a flower whose petals fall; of time all telescoped into one lucid channel through wh. my heroine was to pass at will. The petals falling. But nothing came of it. I shirked the effort—seemed to have no impulse that way, supposed that I had worked out my vein. Faith Henderson came to tea, &, valiantly beating the waters of conversation, I sketched the possibilities which an unattractive woman, penniless, alone, might yet bring into being. I began imagining the position—how she would stop a motor on the Dover road, & so get to Dover: cross the channel: &c. It struck me, vaguely, that I might write a Defoe narrative for fun. Suddenly between twelve & one I conceived a whole fantasy to be called “The Jessamy Brides”—why, I wonder? I have rayed round it several scenes. Two women, poor, solitary at the top of a house. One can see anything (for this is all fantasy) the Tower Bridge, clouds, aeroplanes. Also old men listening in the room over the way. Everything is to be tumbled in pall mall. It is to be written as I write letters at the top of my speed: on the ladies of Llangollen; on Mrs Fladgate; on people passing. No attempt is to be made to realise the character. Sapphism is to be suggested. Satire is to be the main note—satire & wildness. The Ladies are to have Constantinople in view. Dreams of golden domes. My own lyric vein is to be satirised. Everything mocked. And it is to end with three dots … so. For the truth is I feel the need of an escapade after these serious poetic experimental books Orlando leading to The Waves. (July 8th 1933) whose form is always so closely considered. I want to kick up my heels & be off. I want to embody all those innumerable little ideas & tiny stories which flash into my mind at all seasons. I think this will be great fun to write; & it will rest my head before starting the very serious, mystical poetical work which I want to come next. Meanwhile, before I can touch the Jessamy Brides, I have to write my book on fiction & that wont be done till January, I suppose. I might dash off a page or two now & then by way of experiment. And it is possible that the idea will evaporate. Anyhow this records the odd hurried unexpected way in which these things suddenly create themselves—one thing on top of another in about an hour. So I made up Jacob’s Room looking at the fire at Hogarth House; so I made up The Lighthouse one afternoon in the square here."
1927.03.21,"This is the kind of evening when one seems to be abroad: the window is open; the yellows & greys of the houses seem exposed to the summer; there is that rumour & clamour which reminds one of Italy. Almost in a week now we shall be starting. I dislike the days before going. I went to buy clothes today & was struck by my own ugliness. Like Edith Sitwell I can never look like other people—too broad, tall, flat, with hair hanging. And now my neck is so ugly … But I never think of this at home.

How disturbing the summer is! We shall sit reading with the windows open tonight, but my mind will only just touch the page & float off. Something unsettled & melancholy will be in the air. Also it seems the threshold of that vast burning London summer, which alarms me slightly, Vita & Harold will be back; my book will be out. We shall sit in the Square. But I shall not let things worry me much, (so I say—but it is still only March.) We shall have a week at Cassis—a strange resurrection of us all abroad. Many years have gone since Nessa, Clive & I met there. Never with Leonard of course.

My brain is ferociously active. I want to have at my books as if I were conscious of the lapse of time, age & death. Dear me, how lovely some parts of The Lighthouse are! Soft & pliable, & I think deep, & never a word wrong for a page at a time. This I feel about the dinner party, & the children in the boat; but not of Lily on the lawn. That I do not much like. But I like the end.

I get too many letters to answer nowadays. Edith Sitwell came to tea: transparent like some white bone one picks up on a moor, with sea water stones on her long frail hands which slide into yours much narrower than one expects like a folded fan. She has pale gemlike eyes; & is dressed, on a windy March day, in three decker skirts of red spotted cotton. She half shuts her eyes; coos an odd little laugh, reminding me of the Fishers [VW’s cousins]. All is very tapering & pointed, the nose running on like a mole. She said I was a great writer, which pleased me. So sensitive to everything in people & books she said. She got talking about her mother, blaspheming in the nursery, hysterical, terrible; setting Edith to kill bluebottles. ‘But nobody can take a liberty with her’ said Edith, who prides herself on Angevin blood. She is a curious product, likable to me: sensitive, etiolated, affectionate, lonely, having to thread her way (there is something ghostlike & angular about her) home to Bayswater to help cook dinner. She said she would like to attach great bags & balloons of psychology, people having dinner, &c, to her poems, but has no knowledge of human nature, only these sudden intense poems—which by the way she has sent me. In other ages she would have been a cloistered nun; or an eccentric secluded country old maid. It is the oddity of our time that has set her on the music hall stage. She trips out into the Limelight with all the timidity & hauteur of the aristocratic spinster."
1927.05.01,"We came back on Thursday night from Rome; from that other private life which I mean to have for ever now. There is a complete existence in Italy: apart from this. One is nobody in Italy: one has no name, no calling, no background. And, then, not only is there the beauty, but a different relationship. Altogether I dont think I’ve ever enjoyed one month so much. What a faculty of enjoyment one has! I liked everything. I wish I were not so ignorant of Italian, art, literature & so on. However, I cannot now write this out, or go into the great mass of feeling which it composed in me. Nelly was found, at 11.30, when we got back, in bed, with some mysterious affection of the kidney. This was a jar; the coffee was a jar; everything was a jar. And then I remember how my book is coming out. People will say I am irreverent—people will say a thousand things. But I think, honestly, I care very little this time—even for the opinion of my friends. I am not sure if it is good. I was disappointed when I read it through the first time. Later I liked it. Anyhow it is the best I can do. But would it be a good thing to read my things when they are printed, critically? It is encouraging that, in spite of obscurity, affectation & so on, my sales rise steadily. We have sold, already, 1220 before publication, & I think it will be about 1500, which for a writer like I am is not bad. Yet, to show I am genuine, I find myself thinking of other things with absorption & forgetting that it will be out on Thursday. Leonard never thinks of his book. Vita comes back on Friday. I am angry with Clive for gossiping about my letter to Nessa. It is fine, cold, clear, we dine out, have a char."
1927.05.05,"Book out. We have sold (I think) 1690 before publication—twice Dalloway. I write however in the shadow of the damp cloud of the Times Lit Sup. review, which is an exact copy of the JsR. Mrs Dalloway review, gentlemanly, kindly, timid & praising beauty, doubting character, & leaving me moderately depressed. I am anxious about Time Passes. Think the whole thing may be pronounced soft, shallow, insipid, sentimental. Yet, honestly, don’t much care; want to be let alone to ruminate. Odd how strong this feeling is in me. Now I think we are safe to get our motor car. The next fortnight we shall both be depressed about our books.

Dined with the Wests last night, all solid, shiny, spread & spacious; as if they were settling in; wedding presents; clean covers, carpets, &c. all too handsome for my taste. I’m reverting to squalor as my milieu. And then why did she marry him? He is the type of any other cleyerish young journalist, common, glib: uneasy last night, lest we should talk of Angus. But we talked of Madge.

I know why I am depressed: a bad habit of making up the review I should like before reading the review I get. I am excited about my article on Poetry & Fiction. Writing for an audience always stirs me. I hope to avoid too many jokes. Then Vita will come tomorrow. But I dont want people: I want solitude; Rome.

Nelly away; Pinker [dog] away; Clive coming back; Opera in swing; Francis to see me about writing; fine spring weather."
1927.05.11,"Vita back; unchanged, though I daresay one’s relation changes from day to day. Clive & she together. I think Clive is pretty miserable: his stay at Cassis a failure, so far as writing goes. And then the question rises, has he not gone too far in eating, drinking, love making, to stop dead now? He seemed random & unsettled, much as when he left, only now with no absolute hard arm to cling to, as he fancied when he went to Cassis. He talked (always shifting away from himself yet returning, ambiguously to that centre) about going mad: sometimes thought he was going mad; then how one’s life was over; one was spent, played out; this was clear when one saw Julian & Quentin. After all, its an ignominious position to have made the grand refusal, & gone back on it. Mary was at the opera, on a hot evening like this think of listening to Wagner, he said. There’s Saxon upstairs, Mary & Sibyl Colefax below. This was all said half enviously, yet doubtfully; as if not knowing what line to take.

My book. What is the use of saying one is indifferent to reviews when positive praise, though mingled with blame, gives one such a start on, that instead of feeling dried up, one feels, on the contrary, flooded with ideas? I gather from vague hints, through Margery Joad, through Clive, that some people say it is my best book. So far Vita praises; Dotty enthuses; an unknown donkey writes. No one has yet read it to the end, I daresay; & I shall hover about, not anxious but worried for 2 more weeks, when it will be over."
1927.05.16,"The book. Now on its feet so far as praise is concerned. It has been out 10 days—Thursday a week ago. Nessa enthusiastic—a sublime, almost upsetting spectacle. She says it is an amazing portrait of mother; a supreme portrait painter; has lived in it; found the rising of the dead almost painful. Then Ottoline, then Vita, then Charlie [Sanger], then Lord Olivier, then Tommie, then Clive: poor Clive—he came in, ostensibly to praise this ‘amazing book—far the best you’ve ever written’ but found Eddie who imposed himself resolutely, sharply; & so sat on, but how wandering & unhappy. I have scarcely seen him in this mood ever before—like a person awaked from a sweet dream. But what is it? A disillusionment? A shock? He sees Mary. Has he lost faith? Has the dancing mist of rhapsody failed him—he who was based so solidly on such beef & beer or champagne rather. Suppose one woke & found oneself a fraud? It was part of my madness—that horror. But then as Clive said, you go mad but you bound up again—the inference being that he was to stay mad.

This it did on July 13th Sold 1802 of The L.: if it makes 3,000 I shall be as they say more than content. Mervyn [Arnold-Forster] dead—did I record; & I haunted for a time by the sight of his prim pinched face, with the nice blue eyes, so suddenly stilled: so unseasonably. The eye plays a large part in these affairs."
1927.06.06,"I have been in bed a week with a sudden & very sharp headache, & this is written experimentally to test my brain. It is a horrid dull damp Bank holiday morning—(here L. comes in & we spend fifteen minutes discussing advertisements. The L. has sold 2,200 & we are reprinting). Nessa says its ugly weather when I ring up to offer her half a bottle of turpentine to paint her cupboard with.

But I would like to learn to write a steady plain narrative style. Then perhaps I could catch up with the last few weeks; describe my visit to Oxford; & how I lunched with Clive & dined with Dadie & stood in the basement printing Gottstalk with a great sense of shade & shelter. I like the obscure anonymity of the Press better a good deal than I like Voltaire by Riding. And now, with Morgan’s morganatic, evasive, elusive letter this morning, The Lighthouse is behind me: my headache over; & after a week at Rodmell, my freedom from inspection, my deep dive into my own mind will begin.

How odd, it comes into my mind, is Nessa & my jealousy of each other’s clothes! I feel her, when I put on my smart black fringed cape, anguished for a second: did I get it from Champco? in the same way I run my eye over her Paris dress, & compare it with my last year’s Brooke. Then she says she is going to wear earrings: I say at once that I will; this she resents. Yet, we are both fundamentally sensible, & soon recover from our umbrage.

I think, however, I am now almost an established figure—as a writer. They dont laugh at me any longer. Soon they will take me for granted. Possibly I shall be a celebrated writer. Anyhow, The Lighthouse is much more nearly a success, in the usual sense of the word, than any other book of mine.

A great knot of people came together suddenly last week, or the week before. Tom—so glad to gossip with me off handedly over a cup—no 6 cups—of tea; then he played the gramophone: & Logan, pink & spruce, doing his trick of culture & urbanity & good sense very efficiently. He had been evoking the spirit of Henry James with Desmond in Paris. (Sibyl, by the way, takes to herself all credit for that fund, I observe. Sibyl, Clive & Raymond say, has sold her soul to the devil, & he’s now come to fetch it—This phrase is common to them both, & gives the measure of smart talk at lunch parties.) Lytton, too, I saw: an invalid after an attack of love, the most desperate since Duncan. We talked, with poor marble eyed Cynthia Noble attentive, as far as she can be, about the O’B. & his life. I often glide into intimacy with Lytton about books. He is enthusiastic, his mind bare, his attention extremely alive, about books; whereas, about love, its more cryptic. Dadie & Douglas were both starched & powdered like pasteboard young men at the ballet; legs quite straight; heads curled; shirts granulated; they were going on to Kitchin’s party, to be bored, as they knew; but in perfect trim for it. This Lytton does not quite achieve. We dined ostentatiously rather, it being part of the game to order food from Fortnum & Mason’s; part of the pathetic, rather attractive, yet also foolish, showing off, very youthful game of being precisely like other people."
1927.06.18,"This is a terribly thin diary for some reason: half the year has been spent, & left only these few sheets. Perhaps I have been writing too hard in the morning to write here also. Three weeks wiped out by headache. We had a week at Rodmell, of which I remember various sights, suddenly unfolding before me spontaneously (for example, the village standing out to sea in the June night, houses seeming ships, the marsh a fiery foam) & the immense comfort of lying there lapped in peace. I lay out all day in the new garden, with the terrace. It is already being made. There were blue tits nested in the hollow neck of my Venus. Vita came over one very hot afternoon, & we walked to the river with her. Pinker now swims after Leonard’s stick. I read—any trash. Maurice Baring; sporting memoirs. Slowly ideas began trickling in; & then suddenly I rhapsodised (the night L. dined with the apostles) & told over the story of the Moths, which I think I will write very quickly, perhaps in between chapters of that long impending book on fiction. Now the moths will I think fill out the skeleton which I dashed in here: the play-poem idea: the idea of some continuous stream, not solely of human thought, but The Waves of the ship, the night &c, all flowing together: intersected by the arrival of the bright moths. A man & a woman are to be sitting at table talking. Or shall they remain silent? It is to be a love story: she is finally to let the last great moth in. The contrasts might be something of this sort: she might talk, or think, about the age of the earth: the death of humanity: then moths keep on coming. Perhaps the man could be left absolutely dim. France: near the sea; at night; a garden under the window. But it needs ripening. I do a little work on it in the evening when the gramophone is playing late Beethoven sonatas. (The windows fidget at their fastenings as if we were at sea.)

We have been to Hyde Park, where the Church boys were marching; officers on horses in their cloaks like equestrian statues. Always this kind of scene gives me the notion of human beings playing a game, greatly, I suppose, to their own satisfaction.

We saw Vita given the Hawthornden. A horrid show up, I thought: not of the gentry on the platform—Squire, Drinkwater, Binyon only—of us all: all of us chattering writers. My word! how insignificant we all looked! How can we pretend that we are interesting, that our works matter? The whole business of writing became infinitely distasteful. There was no one I could care whether he read, liked, or disliked “my writing”. And no one could care for my criticism either: the mildness, the conventionality of them all struck me. But there may be a stream of ink in them that matters more than the look of them—so tightly clothed, mild, & decorous—showed. I felt there was no one full grown mind among us. In truth, it was the thick dull middle class of letters that met; not the aristocracy. Vita cried at night."
1927.06.22,"Woman haters depress me, & both Tolstoi & Mrs Asquith hate women. I suppose my depression is a form of vanity. But then so are all strong opinions on both sides. I hate Mrs A.’s hard, dogmatic empty style. But enough: I shall write about her tomorrow: I write every day about something, & have deliberately set apart a few weeks to money making, so that I may put £50 in each of our pockets by September. This will be the first money of my own since I married. I never felt the need of it till lately. And I can get it, if I want it, but shirk writing for money.

Clive’s father died yesterday. Harold Nicolson & Duncan dined with us, & Nessa came in afterwards, very silent, inscrutable &, perhaps critical. As a family we distrust anyone outside our set, I think. We too definitely decide that so & so has not the necessary virtues. I daresay Harold has not got them; at the same time, there is a good deal in him I like: he is quick & rash & impulsive; not in our sense, very clever; uneasy; seeming young; on the turn from diplomat to intellectual; not Vita’s match; but honest & cordial. L. says he’s too commonplace. I liked my little duet with him. He wears a green, or blue, shirt & tie; is sunburnt; chubby, pert⁠[?]; vivacious. Talked of politics, but was flimsy compared with Leonard—I thought. Said it was with L. & me that he felt completely at his ease. Told stories wh. sound rather empty in the bare Bloomsbury rooms."
1927.06.23,"This diary shall batten on the leanness of my social life. Never have I spent so quiet a London summer. It is perfectly easy to slip out of the crush unobserved. I have set up my standard as an invalid, & no one bothers me. No one asks me to do anything. Vainly, I have the feeling that this is of my choice, not theirs; & there is a luxury in being quiet in the heart of chaos. Directly I talk & exert my wits in talk I get a dull damp rather headachy day. Quiet brings me cool clear quick mornings, in which I dispose of a good deal of work, & toss my brain into the air when I take a walk. I shall feel some triumph if I skirt a headache this summer.

I sat with Nessa in the Square yesterday. Angelica sends Pinker after a ball. Nessa & I sit on the seat & gossip. She is to see Mary; she is to go to old Bell’s funeral. She is learning to motor. She has sold a picture. The point of Clive’s affair is that Mary is in love with another. This point was carefully hidden before Easter. His vanity was careful to hide it: her discretion. So I got my version out of proportion. The truth is odd enough though. Unless she will bed with him he is distracted. That she will not do; yet, for lack of him, is distracted herself. The love affair rather increases on her side. It is said to be for someone low in the world. This inclines us to think it Lord Ivor. But the point is one for curiosity only.

Vita’s book [The Land] verberates & reverberates in the Press. A prize poem—that’s my fling at it—for with some relics of jealousy, or it may be of critical sense, I can’t quite take the talk of poetry & even great poetry seriously. But the subject & the manner, so smooth, so mild, may be what I dislike; & perhaps I am corrupt. I wonder what I should think if I could get a cool look at some writing of my own.

Oh & Sibyl has dropped me: & I don’t feel the fall.

What is then the abiding truth in this phantasmagoria, I ask myself, seeking as I often do some little nugget of pure gold. I think, often, I have the happiest of lives, in having discovered stability. Now one stable moment vanquishes chaos. But this I said in The Lighthouse. We have now sold, I think, 2555 copies.

I am distressed by my failure to make cigarettes. I had a lesson from a man in Francis Street—cant do a thing with my fingers. Angelica is expert with hers already. Nessa says all painters are: this is a perquisite they get thrown in with their gift.

And Adrian came to tea on Sunday, & fairly sparkled. At last I think he has emerged. Even his analysis will be over this year. At the age of 43 he will be educated & ready to start life. I remember Harry Stephen saying that he had his fingers on the gear—the Indian judgeship that is to say—about then. So we Stephens mature late. And our late flowers are rare & splendid. Think of my books, Nessa’s pictures—it takes us an age to bring our faculties into play. And now I must write to Ethel Sands, & perhaps, go to the Ballet."
1927.06.30,"Now I must sketch out the Eclipse.

About 10 on Tuesday night several very long trains, accurately filled (ours with civil servants) left King’s Cross. In our carriage was Vita & Harold⁠[,] Quentin, L. & I. This is Hatfield I daresay, I said. I was smoking a cigar. Then again, This is Peterborough, L. said. Before it got dark we kept looking at the sky: soft fleecy; but there was one star, over Alexandra Park. Look Vita, that’s Alexandra Park, said Harold. The Nicolsons got sleepy: H. curled up with his head on V.’s knee. She looked like Sappho by Leighton, asleep; so we plunged through the midlands; made a very long stay at York. Then at 3 we got out our sandwiches, & I came in from the wc to find Harold being rubbed clean of cream. Then he broke the china sandwich box. Here L. laughed without restraint. Then we had another doze, or the N.’s did; then here was a level crossing, at which were drawn up a long line of motor omnibuses & motors, all burning pale yellow lights. It was getting grey—still a fleecy mottled sky. We got to Richmond about 3.30: it was cold, & the N.’s had a quarrel, Eddie said, about V.’s luggage. We went off in the omnibus, saw a vast castle (who does that belong to said Vita, who is interested in Castles). It had a front window added, & a light I think burning. All the fields were aburn with June grasses & red tasselled plants, none coloured as yet, all pale. Pale & grey too were the little uncompromising Yorkshire farms. As we passed one, the farmer, & his wife & sister came out, all tightly & tidily dressed in black, as if they were going to church. At another ugly square farm, two women were looking out of the upper windows. These had white blinds drawn down half across them. We were a train of 3 vast cars, one stopping to let the others go on; all very low & powerful; taking immensely steep hills. The driver once got out & put a small stone behind our wheel—inadequate. An accident would have been natural. There were also many motor cars. These suddenly increased as we crept up to the top of Bardon Fell. Here were people camping beside their cars. We got out, & found ourselves very high, on a moor, boggy, heathery, with butts for grouse shooting. There were grass tracks here & there, & people had already taken up positions. So we joined them, walking out to what seemed the highest point looking over Richmond. One light burnt down there. Vales & moors stretched, slope after slope, round us. It was like the Haworth country. But over Richmond, where the sun was rising, was a soft grey cloud. We could see by a gold spot where the sun was. But it was early yet. We had to wait, stamping to keep warm. Ray [Strachey] had wrapped herself in the blue striped blanket off a double bed. She looked incredibly vast & bedroomish. Saxon looked very old. Leonard kept looking at his watch. Four great red setters came leaping over the moor. There were sheep feeding behind us. Vita had tried to buy a guinea pig—Quentin advised a savage—so she observed the animals from time to time. There were thin places in the cloud, & some complete holes. The question was whether the sun would show through a cloud or through one of these hollow places when the time came. We began to get anxious. We saw rays coming through the bottom of the clouds. Then, for a moment we saw the sun, sweeping—it seemed to be sailing at a great pace & clear in a gap; we had out our smoked glasses; we saw it crescent, burning red; next moment it had sailed fast into the cloud again; only the red streamers came from it; then only a golden haze, such as one has often seen. The moments were passing. We thought we were cheated; we looked at the sheep; they showed no fear; the setters were racing round; everyone was standing in long lines, rather dignified, looking out. I thought how we were like very old people, in the birth of the world—druids on Stonehenge: (this idea came more vividly in the first pale light though;) At the back of us were great blue spaces in the cloud. These were still blue. But now the colour was going out. The clouds were turning pale; a reddish black colour. Down in the valley it was an extraordinary scrumble of red & black; there was the one light burning; all was cloud down there, & very beautiful, so delicately tinted. Nothing could be seen through the cloud. The 24 seconds were passing. Then one looked back again at the blue: & rapidly, very very quickly, all the colours faded; it became darker & darker as at the beginning of a violent storm; the light sank & sank: we kept saying this is the shadow; & we thought now it is over—this is the shadow when suddenly the light went out. We had fallen. It was extinct. There was no colour. The earth was dead. That was the astonishing moment: & the next when as if a ball had rebounded, the cloud took colour on itself again, only a sparky aetherial colour & so the light came back. I had very strongly the feeling as the light went out of some vast obeisance; something The colour for some moments was of the most lovely kind—fresh, various—here blue & there brown: all new colours, as if washed over & repainted. kneeling down, & low & suddenly raised up, when the colours came, They came back astonishingly lightly & quickly & beautifully in the valley & over the hills—at first with a miraculous glittering & aetheriality, later normally almost, but with a great sense of relief. It was like recovery. We had been much worse than we had expected. We had seen the world dead. This was within the power of nature. Our greatness had been apparent too. Now we became Ray in a blanket, Saxon in a cap &c. We were bitterly cold. I should say that the cold had increased as the light went down. One felt very livid. Then—it was over till 1999. What remained was a sense of the comfort which we get used to, of plenty of light & colour. This for some time seemed a definitely welcome thing. Yet when it became established all over the country, one rather missed the sense of its being a relief & a respite, which one had had when it came back after the darkness. How can I express the darkness? It was a sudden plunge, when one did not expect it: being at the mercy of the sky: our own nobility: the druids; Stonehenge; & the racing red dogs; all that was in ones mind. Also, to be picked out of ones London drawing room & set down on the wildest moors in England was impressive. For the rest, I remember trying to keep awake in the gardens at York while Eddy talked & falling asleep. Asleep again in the train. It was hot & we were merry. The carriage was full of things. Harold was very kind & attentive: Eddy was peevish. Roast beef & pineapple chunks, he said. We got home at 8.30 perhaps."
1927.07.04,"Back from Long Barn. Thank heaven, I never had to change my dress. Such opulence & freedom, flowers all out, butler, silver, dogs, biscuits, wine, hot water, log fires, Italian cabinets, Persian rugs, books—this was the impression it made: as of stepping into a rolling gay sea, with nicely crested waves: as if the anxious worn life had suddenly been set on springs, & went bounding, springing for the week end. Yet I like this room better perhaps: more effort & life in it, to my mind, unless this is the prejudice one has naturally in favour of the display of one’s own character. Vita very opulent, in her brown velvet coat with the baggy pockets, pearl necklace, & slightly furred cheeks. (They are like saviours flannel, of which she picked me a great bunch, in texture) Of its kind this is the best, most representative human life I know: I mean, certain gifts & qualities & good fortunes are here miraculously combined—I liked Harold too. He is a spontaneous childlike man, of no great boring power; has a mind that bounces when he drops it; he opens his eyes as he looks at one; has a little immature moustache; curled hair; an air of immaturity which is welcome. I should judge him very generous & kind hearted; an Englishman overlaid with culture; coming of a sunburnt country stock; & not much fined even by diplomacy. After dinner last night we discussed the Empire. “I prefer Sydney to Paris. Australia is more important than France. After all, its our younger sons out there. I feel proud of it. The point is, Raymond, our English genius is for government.” “The governed don’t seem to enjoy it” said Raymond. Silly ass, said Harold. “We do our job: disinterestedly; we dont think of ourselves, as the French do, as the Germans do. Take the British oil fields. There’s a hospital there where they take any one, employee or not. The natives come from all over the place. Don’t tell me thats not a good thing. And they trust us.” So on to the system of bribery; to the great age of England being the age of colonial expansion. “I grant Shakespeare’s a nasty snag.” “But why not grow, change?” I said. Also, I said, recalling the aeroplanes that had flown over us, while the portable wireless played dance music on the terrace, “can’t you see that nationality is over? All divisions are now rubbed out, or about to be.” Raymond vehemently assented. Raymond is all for the triumph of mind. What action matters? Actions matter most of all, said Harold. I was sitting on a carved Italian stool over the log fire; he & Raymond bedded in the soft green sofa. Leonard’s injustice to the aristocracy was discussed. Before this, Lord Sackville & Mrs Rubens had come over, partly to protect their respectability, partly to play tennis. (They won’t stay at Knole alone if possible; & if they must, sanctify the proceeding by calling on Vita). He is a smooth worn man, inheriting noble nose & chin which he has not put much into himself; a straight, young looking man, save that his face has the lack lustre of a weak man whose life has proved too much for him. No longer does he struggle much for happiness, I imagine; accepts resignedly; & goes to Maidstone almost daily, as part of the routine of his nobility. He plays golf; he plays tennis. He thinks Bernard Darwin must be a man of surpassing brain power. We sat together under a vast goat skin coat of Vita’s, watching them play? & I found him smooth & ambling as a blood horse, but obliterated, obfusc, with his great Sackville eyes drooping, & his face all clouded with red & brown. One figured a screw or other tool whose worms & edges have been rubbed smooth, so that though they shine, plaid silver, they no longer grip.

Vita very free & easy, always giving me great pleasure to watch, & recalling some image of a ship breasting a sea, nobly, magnificently, with all sails spread, & the gold sunlight on them. As for her poetry, or intelligence, save when canalised in the traditional channels, I can say nothing very certain. She never breaks fresh ground. She picks up what the tide rolls to her feet. For example, she follows, with simple instinct, all the inherited tradition of furnishing, so that her house is gracious, glowing, stately, but without novelty or adventure. So with her poetry, I daresay. Raymond & I travelled up & discussed them. She the most noble character he said; both almost defiantly fortunate, so that Harold touches wood when he reflects on his own life, heaves a sigh & says how, if it were dashed down tomorrow, he would have had his day. But it wont be dashed down at all. It will grow freely & fully round them both; their fruit will ripen, & their leaves golden; & the night will be indigo blue, with a soft gold moon. They lack only what we have—some cutting edge; some invaluable idiosyncracy, intensity, for which I would not have all the sons & all the moons in the world."
1927.07.11,"Waiting for what I do not exactly know. In a mood of random restlessness—Nelly having for 125th time ‘given notice’ this morning. Shall I go to Ashley Gardens [Registry Office] & engage Mrs Collins & her daughter? I am sick of the timid spiteful servant mind; yet perhaps Mrs Collins will be of the same feather. Never mind.

A great storm has torn off one wing of my double windows. But I have never mentioned the absorbing subject—the subject which has filled our thoughts to the exclusion of Clive & Mary & literature & death & life—motor cars. Every evening we go round with Pinker for a game in Gordon Sqre—I talk as if the evenings had been fine—no, we sit there in between the sulphur coloured storms; under the shelter of trees with the rain pattering between the leaves. We talk of nothing but cars. Then, sometimes, word is brought that Mrs Bell is at the door in her car. I rush out, & find her, rather nervously in control of a roomy shabby Renault with Fred beside her. Three times I have been for a little tour with her. And yesterday we commissioned Fred to find us & bring instantly to our door, a Singer. We have decided on a Singer. And, the reason why I am distracted now is that Fred is going to ring me up & say if I am to have my first lesson this evening. The sun is shining; the trees dripping. Possibly I may go.

This is a great opening up in our lives. One may go to Bodiam, to Arundel, explore the Chichester downs, expand that curious thing, the map of the world in ones mind. It will I think demolish loneliness, & may of course imperil complete privacy. The Keynes’ have one too—a cheap one. Nessa thinks it will break down at once. Nessa takes a very sinister view of the Keynes’. She anticipates ruin of every sort for them, with some pleasure too. Here’s Leonard—So then I tell him about the storm, about the telephones, & about Pinker. Then Sibyl who has cut me these 3 months, suddenly writes to say she has been ‘unwell’, & will I come to tea. No I wont. And now I must quickly dress for Clive’s party, where I am to meet Cory & Nessa & Duncan & Christabel: for there’s a plethora of parties this week, & tomorrow I’m missing Lydia & Stravinsky; but a kind of philosophy protects me: I shall make out a happy evening somehow; & find a curious pleasure in staying away, imagining. So I must stop & write to Sibyl. With any luck The Lighthouse will reach 3,000 this week."
1927.07.23,"This is very near the end of the London season. I go to Ethel [Sand]’s at Dieppe (I’m rather proud of crossing the channel again) on Wednesday, then back to Newhaven, where I may be met by my own car. Since making the last entry I have learnt enough to drive a car in the country alone. On the backs of paper I write down instructions for starting cars. We have a nice light little shut up car in which we can travel thousands of miles. It is very dark blue, with a paler line round it. The world gave me this for writing The Lighthouse, I reflect, a book which has now sold 3,160 (perhaps) copies: will sell 3,500 before it dies, & thus far exceeds any other of mine.

The night I did not go to Stravinsky Desmond came, tender & garrulous & confidential. I remember leaning with him out of the window. He was full of love for everyone. He said he loved the way Melinda [unidentified] scratched her head or put on her gloves. He said he was now in love with his children. When Derraod asks him for a new perspective for his microscope he feels what he used to feel when he was in love with a woman. He resents his gift of money a little, since he was making £2,000 a year; but then he had ‘arrears’; & has now, evidently—£200 to the Bank, £200 for income tax & so on. We talked of love owing to Clive. For that night after I dined with Clive & went through some rather artificial gambols with Christa⁠[bel McLaren] (who has always thought of me as Virginia; & can’t quite lose the sense of my being a perfect lady “Look at those hands”) Clive walked me round, & standing under the lamp expressed his complete disillusion. “My dear Virginia, life is over. There’s no good denying it. We’re 45. I’m bored, I’m bored, I’m unspeakably bored. I know my own reactions. I know what I’m going to say. I’m not interested in a thing. Pictures bore me. I take up a book & put it down. No one’s interested in what I think any more. I go about thinking about suicide. I admire you for having tried to kill yourself.” To think that I should be listening to this in the moonlight from Clive! And he spoke with such dreary good sense too. I could scarcely whip up any ardour of denial. It was all true, it seemed to me. Not, indeed, true of me, but true of him. & so I feebly asked him to come & see me; & I would prove that I was interested in him. He agreed half heartedly, waved his hand, & went off, thinking about suicide. Then we met next night at Raymonds. Hardly had I come into the room but he started up boasting & professing, perfunctorily a little, but boldly enough. He had had an adventure. Life was changed; had met the loveliest of women, seemed the nicest too, was an aristocrat; she had been kind to him; would Raymond come on to supper on Monday? All this was blustered out, with many a cuff at me (for he always wishes he says to hurt me—even over a motor car) & it was about Valerie Taylor, an actress, whom he had met lunching at the Maclagans. For my own part, I am once more at the stage of thinking Clive ‘second rate’. It is all so silly, shallow, & selfish. Granted the charm of his vitality, still one would prefer a finer taste to it. How angry his ‘secondrateness’ used to make me, in connection with Nessa. Now I think of it much less often, but I suppose the feeling is there. All this summer he has twanged so persistently on the one string that one gets bored. Love love love—Clive, Clive, Clive—that’s the tune of it, thrummed with rather callous persistency; a thick finger & thumb. Now love I dare say nothing against; but it is a feeble passion, I mean a gross dull passion, when it has no part in it of imagination, intellect, poetry. Clive’s love is three parts vanity. Now that he can say, or lie, I’ve been to bed with Valerie, his self love is assuaged. He remains Clive the undaunted lover, the Don Juan of Bloomsbury; & whether its true or not, so long as we think it true, scarcely matters. But I own that he pesters me with his jealousy, or whatever it is, does his best to annoy me, & so I’m not quite the impartial judge I might be. The interesting question remains—why does he always wish to hurt me?

So Desmond & I discussed all this. And The Lighthouse too; & I felt, susceptible as I am, he’s doing this partly to thank me for having been generous to him. But I am enough mistress of myself now to let these feelings flow & not disturb my pleasure.

All images are now tinged with driving a motor. Here I think of letting my engine work, with my clutch out.

It has been, on the whole, a fresh well ordered summer. I am not so parched with talk as usual. I have dipped into society more easily. My illness in May was a good thing in some ways; for I got control of society at an early stage, & circumvented my headache, without a complete smash. Thus it has been a free quiet summer: I enjoyed the Eclipse; I enjoyed Long Barn; (where I went twice) I enjoyed sitting with Vita at Kew for 3 or 4 hours under a cloudy sky, & dining at the Petit Riche with her; she refreshes me, & solaces me; I have worked very methodically & done my due of articles, so that with luck, I shall have made £120 over my proper sum by September. That is I shall have made £320 by journalism, & I suppose at least £300 by my novel this year. I have thought too much, though on purpose, with my eyes open, of making money; & once we have each a nest egg I should like to let that sink into my sub-consciousness, & earn easily what we need. Bruce Richmond is coming to tea on Monday to discuss an article on Morgan; & I am going to convey to him the fact that I can’t always refuse £60 in America for the Times’ £10. If I could make easily £350 a year, I would: if I could get some settled job.

At Rodmell I am going, seriously, to begin my book on fiction. With luck I might have this done by January. Then I shall have the Moths full in my brain to pour out. I am keeping it standing a long time, & rather fear that it may lose its freshness. Dadie has involved us (is the word wrong?) with Peter. Dadie dines with Topsy & she pumps him about the Wolves & Peter’s book. Dadie wants to crab it & puts it on to us. Leonard says it doesn’t do; Virginia thinks it ‘Academic’. The result is a long angry letter from Peter, half vanity, half righteous indignation; but we have explained, & all the burden now rests on Dadie. (& partly on me, for Topsy says I wrote her a rude letter about Jane Austen, but this has been explained).

The Press is going on. Novels are the great bloodsuckers. Mary’s book will cost us £100; & we shall lose too on The Marionettes. So in the past two days I have rejected Butts & Daglish & Littell; I fancy that we don’t do as well as we should with novels. And I’m exposed to the hanging lips & clamorous vanity of Lucy Clifford today: she has an article on George Eliot which she wrote for a special fee (that is where I shall end if I dont take care—talking always of ‘fees’) for the Nineteenth Century. Gottstalk is finished.

Rodmell"
1927.08.08,"I was to have written here such a brilliant account of my 3 days at Dieppe. It was to have sprung, suddenly, in a beautiful fountain, out of the table in the window at (name forgotten) overlooking the Seine. The Seine there is very broad, & round the bend come constantly steamers, Norwegian, with petrol, English French; & Nan kept looking to read their names, showing in all she did a sort of nervous tremulous pride in France (or do I imagine this?) which hints at the fact that she likes their life there, alone at Auppegard, better than Ethel. “I’m gregarious” said Ethel a little waspishly, for she is brittle & acid, the spoilt pet of the more dour & upstanding Nan. We were, I think, looking over the cliff with the churchyard on it, the tombstones standing up against the blue sea. But I was to have written this, & now shall not, I suppose.—It is a very narrow house, all window, laid with pale bright Samarcand rugs, & painted greens & blues, with lovely ‘pieces’, & great pots of carefully designed flowers arranged by Loomas. A white bull terrier stalks from room to room, one ear bent over in his fights. Nan, stylishly dressed, sews dusters of an evening, & Ethel craves talk. Nessa & Duncan say that the talk skirts & flits & never settles very long; in fact that the house is built upon the finest silver wood ash: so soft so silver you don’t at first notice how it gets into your throat & makes your skin dry & dusty.

We have motored most days. We opened one little window when we bought the gramophone; now another/ opens with the motor—I was going to say, but stopped."
1927.08.10,"Yes, the motor is turning out the joy of our lives, an additional life, free & mobile & airy to live alongside our usual stationary industry. We spin off to Falmer, ride over the Downs, drop into Rottingdean, then sweep over to Seaford, call, in pouring rain at Charleston, pass the time of day with Clive—Nessa is at Bodiam—return for tea, all as light & easy as a hawk in the air. Soon we shall look back at our pre-motor days as we do now at our days in the caves. After a week here, Leonard has become perfectly efficient; I am held back by insufficient lessons, but shall be expert before September is half through. Various little improvements in the house keep me on the thrill with hope & despair. Shall I lavish £5 that will be mine on a new spare bed?—alas, I fear I must; then the great & distasteful operations of furnishing will be over, & next year I shall add ornament & comfort. Perhaps if I make an extra sum we might build a bed sitting room for me in the attic, enlarge L.’s study, & so have a desirable, roomy, light house. For if we had £300 every year to spend, it is difficult to think of anything, except this, travel, & pocket money, to spend it on. Here at the age of 45 are Nessa & I growing little wings again after our lean years. She may rake in another £500; perhaps more. Already she has bought a roll of linoleum & a cupboard. But my state is precarious. With The Lighthouse I may just have climbed to the top of my hill; or again we may wobble back; my journalism may pall on the Americans: no rich father in law will endow me; but Heaven knows, have not much anxiety. We are flexible, adventurous still I hope.

An odd incident, psychologically as the vanished Kot used to say, has been Morgan’s serious concern about my article on him. Did I care a straw what he said about me? Was it more laudatory? Yet here is this self-possessed, aloof man taking every word to heart, cast down to the depths, apparently, because I do not give him superlative rank, & writing again & again to ask about it, or suggest about it, anxious that it shall be published in England, & also that more space shall be given to the Passage to India. Had I been asked, I should have said that of all writers he would be the most indifferent & cool under criticism. And he minds a dozen times more than I do, who have the opposite reputation.

This brings me back to those last days in London when I called on Ottoline, had a shabby easy intimate talk with her, & then, inadvertently as if by touching a button brought on me the whole shower bath of Philip’s affection. He came the next day, inconveniently, & the day after when Sibyl was there. Once more I felt the uneasy excitement of ‘love’, that is of physical desire making someone restless, too restless & emotional to talk simply. But L. came in; Pinker came in, & the amorous Philip, who has lost most of his good looks & is coarse as an old ram, had to leave. But I found a letter at Rodmell, quoting J.’s Room—‘Come back to me Darling’—with which I shall make Vita jealous tomorrow. But what course to take, especially now that he is our neighbour, I do not altogether know; nor whether to answer his letter or not.

This, however, is Nelly’s first evening back, in the flush of good temper, with Gladys [a niece?], & I am beginning to think of my dinner. Since I dined at Auppegard I cannot be said to have dined at all: ham & eggs; cheese & raspberries; once a baked pudding—so we have fed at the hands of poor emaciated Mrs Bartholomew."
1927.08.21,"Some little scenes I meant to write down.

One was on the flats towards Ripe one blazing hot day. We stopped in a bye road about 3 in the afternoon, & heard hymn singing. It was very lonely & desolate. Here were people singing to themselves, in the hot afternoon. I looked & saw a middle class ‘lady’ in skirt & coat & ribboned hat, by the cottage door. She was making the daughters of the agricultural labourers sing; it was about three o’clock on a Tuesday perhaps. Later we passed the ladies house; it had a wooden griffin nailed above the door—presumably her crest.

What I like, or one of the things I like, about motoring is the sense it gives one of lighting accidentally, like a voyager who touches another planet with the tip of his toe, upon scenes which would have gone on, have always gone on, will go on, unrecorded, save for this chance glimpse. Then it seems to me I am allowed to see the heart of the world uncovered for a moment. It strikes me that the hymn singing in the flats went on precisely so in Cromwell’s time.

That was our only hot day, I think. One day the rain splashed down so fast that it rose again in a fountain, up off the road in our faces."
1927.09.04,"Many scenes have come & gone unwritten, since it is today the 4th Sept, a cold grey blowy day, made memorable by the sight of a kingfisher, & by my sense, waking early, of being again visited by ‘the spirit of delight’. “Rarely rarely comest thou, spirit of delight.” That was I singing this time last year; & sang so poignantly that I have never forgotten it, or my vision of a fin rising on a wide blank sea. No biographer could possibly guess this important fact about my life in the late summer of 1926: yet biographers pretend they know people.

A happy summer, this? Well, a striving working splashing social summer. Many meetings; & one or two gaieties. I amuse myself by watching my mind shape scenes. We sat in a field strewn with cut grass at Michelham Priory the other day. It was roasting hot. There was Angus with his pink shirt open; Duncan strolling along with a sketchbook under his arm; the sound of rushing waters; Nessa driving her old blue bonnet with Angelica perched beside her. Nothing much is said on these occasions; but the memory remains: made of what? Of coloured shirts; the pink roof of the Gateway against a greyblue sky; & Pinker; & my being cross about my book on fiction; & Leonard silent; & a great quarrel that hot night; & I coming up here to sit alone in the dark, & L. following me; & sharp hard words; right & wrong on both sides; peace making; sleep; content.

A graveyard scene.

Mr Malthouse’s son, a sailor, died of consumption & was buried in the churchyard under the big tree. I went into the churchyard with Angelica that fine afternoon. Avery was digging the grave, throwing up heavy showers of the yellow earth. Mrs Avery, immensely fat & florid, was sprawling on the edge of the grave, with her small children playing about. They were having tea, & dressed in their reds & blue looked more like a picture, by Millais, or some other Victorian, of life & death, youth & the grave, than any real sight. It was quite unconscious; yet the most deliberate picture making; hence, unreal, sentimental, overdone.

The Flying Princess, I forget her name, has been drowned in her purple leather breeches. I suppose so at least. Their petrol gave out about midnight on Thursday, when the aeroplane must have come gently down upon the long slow Atlantic waves. I suppose they burnt a light which showed streaky on the water for a time. There they rested a moment or two. The pilots, I think, looked back at the broad cheeked desperate eyed vulgar princess in her purple breeches & I suppose made some desperate dry statement—how the game was up: sorry; fortune against them; & she just glared; & then a wave broke over the wing; & the machine tipped. And she said something theatrical I daresay; nobody was sincere; all acted a part; nobody shrieked; Luck against us—something of that kind, they said, & then So long, & first one man was washed off & went under; & then a great wave came & the Princess threw up her arms & went down; & the third man sat saved for a second looking at the rolling waves, so patient so implacable & the moon gravely regarding; & then with a dry snorting sound he too was tumbled off & rolled over, & the aeroplane rocked & rolled—miles from anywhere, off Newfoundland, while I slept at Rodmell, & Leonard was dining with the Craniums in London."
1927.09.05,"Having solidified the vision of the flying Princess into words, I have, strangely enough, laid a phantom which has been very prominent before my eyes. Why should this be so? Some dissatisfaction seems laid to rest. So, gradually, the urgency of the memory dies out too, as in one’s own life; in about 48 or 96 hours all trace of the death of the Princess in her purple breeches is smoothed over.

As a matter of fact, we are just in from Brighton, & my mind is agitated by having bought a jersey, which I like; & by having let Leonard bump the back of the car on the gate post. So, to soothe these whirlpools, I write here. We went to Brighton today; & thus added a pounds worth of pleasure to life. Monotony is avoided. Oh, & I thought—but the thought is already escaping—about the enormous activity of the human kind; his feverish runnings about; Brighton & the roads being nothing but a swarm & agitation of human flesh; & yet it is not despicable.

And when I get back here, the same energy is bringing the men back from harvest across the fields; & old Mr Grey, & the poor plodding horse [?]. Now a really comprehensive magnificent statesmanlike mind would take stock of all this human activity & direct it & weld it together. I see this possibility by fits & starts: I see human beings as at the beginning of a vast enterprise, not merely with the usual writers care for the aesthetic quality. This is a point of view which is more & more forced upon one by places like Peacehaven. All aesthetic quality is there destroyed. Only turning & tumbling energy is left. The mind is like a dog going round & round to make itself a bed. So, give me new & detestable ideas, I will somehow trample a bed out of them."
1927.09.20,"A thousand things to be written had I time: had I power. A very little writing uses up my capacity for writing:

Laughton Place & Philip Ritchie’s death

These as it happened, synchronised. When Vita was here 10 days ago we drove over to Laughton, & I broke in, & explored the house. It seemed, that sunny morning, so beautiful, so peaceful; & as if it had endless old rooms. So I came home boiling with the idea of buying it; & so fired L. that we wrote to the farmer, Mr Russell, & waited, all on wires, edgy, excited for an answer. He came himself, after some days; & we were to go & see it. This arranged, & our hopes very high, I opened the Morning Post & read the death of Philip Ritchie. “He cant take houses, poor Philip” I thought. And then the usual procession of images went through my mind. Also, I think for the first time, I felt this death leaves me an elderly laggard; makes me feel I have no right to go on; as if my life were at the expense of his. And I had not been kind; not asked him to dinner & so on. So the two feelings—about buying the house & his death—fought each other: & sometimes the house won & sometimes death won; & we went to see the house & it turned out unspeakably dreary; all patched & spoilt; with grained oak & grey paper; a sodden garden & a glaring red cottage at the back. I note the strength & vividness of feelings which suddenly break & foam away. Now I forget to think about Philip Ritchie.

One of these days, though, I shall sketch here, like a grand historical picture, the outlines of all my friends. I was thinking of this in bed last night, & for some reason I thought I would begin with a sketch of Gerald Brenan. There may be something in this idea. It might be a way of writing the memoirs of one’s own times during peoples lifetimes. It might be a most amusing book. The question is how to do it. Vita should be Orlando, a young nobleman. There should be Lytton. & it should be truthful; but fantastic. Roger. Duncan. Clive. Adrian. Their lives should be related. But I can think of more books than I shall ever be able to write. How many little stories come into my head! For instance: Ethel Sands not looking at her letters. What this implies. One might write a book of short significant separate scenes. She did not open her letters.

We motored to Long Barn & back yesterday, through suburbs for the most part. All Hampstead, red, sanitary, earnest, view gazing, breeze requiring is lodged in the heights of Ashdown Forest. Now & again one comes on something consciously preserved like the Wren house at Groombridge. One stops the motor & looks. So do other motorists. We found Vita & Dotty sitting over a log fire. Dottie is going to spend £200 a year on poetry: to edit a series of books of unsaleable poetry. This £200 she was giving to the Poetry Bookshop, but deterred by his earnestness & his drunkenness she is crying off: & has laid it at our feet. There will be much comment she says at this. People will say she is buying her way into Bloomsbury. The children were there; Nigel very shabby: Vita dressed him as a Russian boy “Dont. It makes me look like a little girl” he said. There was the French tutor who never spoke. Dotty byronic in her dress, but much improved over the London Dotty. They do not yet know what is to become of Harold, who has refused to go to Buda Pesth.

And Quentin came, & the Keynes’s came, & Morgan came. All of this I meant, perhaps, to describe: but then how hard I drive my pen through one article after another—Hemingway, Morgan, Shelley; & now Biography.

Quentin wont let us play him Wagner: prefers Bach. Nessa’s children are terrifyingly sophisticated: so Morgan said when Angelica, rigged up in a long black shawl, acted Lady Cornflax & Lady Ottoline at Charleston. They have grown up without any opposition: nothing to twist or stunt. Hence they have reached stages at 16 or 17 which I reached only at 26 or 27.

But the summer, has never burnt; & is now ashes. Already at half past five the light out here is greyish; the wind swirling; all children indoors; & I shall write a letter or two & go into the house: sit over a fire & read, I think, biography.

But we are very happy—seldom more so, I think. Perhaps things are doing rather well. Theres the motor; Dottie’s £200;—& L. said about Laughton Place the other day, “The strange thing is that we always come to the same opinion about things”—which pleased me."
1927.09.25,"On the opposite page I wrote notes for Shelley, I think by mistake for my writing book.

Now let me become the annalist of Rodmell.

Thirty five years ago, there were 160 families living here where there are now no more than 80. It is a decaying village, which loses its boys to the towns. Not a boy of them, said the Rev. Mr Hawkesford, is being taught to plough. Rich people wanting week end cottages buy up the old peasants houses, for fabulous sums. Monks House was offered to Mr H. for £400: we gave £700. He refused it, saying he didn’t wish to own country cottages. Now Mr Allinson will pay £1200 for a couple, & we he said might get £2,000 for this.

He is an old decaying man, run to seed. His cynicism, & the pleasant turn it gives his simple worn out sayings, amuses me. He is sinking into old age, very shabby, loose limbed, wearing black wool mittens. His life is receding like a tide, slowly; or one figures him as a dying candle, whose wick will soon sink into the warm grease & be extinct. To look at, he is like some aged bird; a little, small featured face, with heavily lidded smoky bright eyes; his complexion is still ruddy; but his beard is like an unweeded garden. Little hairs grow weakly all over his cheeks, & two strands are drawn, like pencil marks, across his bald head. He tumbles into an armchair; & tells over his stock of old village stories, which always have this slightly mocking flavour, as though, completely unambitious, & by no means successful himself, he recouped himself by laughing slyly at the humours of the more energetic. He has a hit at Allinson for building; drily tells us how Capt Stamper won’t pay his tithes; how Miss Lucas signs the Captain’s cheques for him. The outlay these flashy newcomers make on their field & farms makes him sardonic. But he wont raise a finger either way; likes his cup of Indian tea, which he prefers to China, & doesn’t much mind what anybody thinks. He smokes endless cigarettes, & his fingers are not very clean. Talking of his well, he said “It would be a different thing if one wanted baths”—which for some 70 years, presumably, he has done without. Then he likes a little practical talk about Aladdin lamps, for instance, & how the Rector at Iford has a device by which he makes the globe of the Veritas lamp wh. is cheaper serve. It appears that the Aladdin costs 10d & 2/-. But it blackens suddenly & is useless. Leaning over stiles, it is of lamp mantles that the two rectors talk. Or he will advise about making a garage: how Percy shd. cut a trench, & then old Fears should line the walls with cement. That is what he advises; & I fancy many many hours of his life have passed hobnobbing with Percys & Fears, about cement & trenches. Of his clerical character there is little visible. He would not buy Bowen a riding school he said; her sister did that. He didn’t believe in it. She has a school at Rottingdean, keeps 12 horses, employs grooms, & has to be at it all day, Sundays included. But having expressed his opinion in the family conclave, he would leave it at that. Mrs H. would back Bowen. She would get her way. The Rector would slouch off to his study, where he does, heaven knows what. I asked him if he had work to do: a question which amused him a little. Not work he said; but a young woman to see. And then he settled into the armchair again, & so sat out a visit of over an hour & a half."
1927.10.05,"I write in the sordid doss house atmosphere of approaching departure. Pinker is asleep in one chair; Leonard is signing cheques at the little deal table under the glare of the lamp. The fire is covered with ashes, since we have been burning it all day, & Mrs B⁠[artholomew]. never cleans. Envelopes lie in the grate. I am writing with a pen which is feeble & wispy; & it is a sharp fine evening with a sunset, I daresay.

We went to Amberley yesterday & think of buying a house there. For it is an astonishing forgotten lovely place, between water meadows & downs. So impulsive we both are, in spite of our years.

But we are not as old as Mrs Gray, who came to thank us for our apples. 1832

86

1918 She won’t send to buy, as it looks like begging, since we never take money. Her face is cut into by wrinkles: they make wheals across her. She is 86, & can never remember such a summer. In her youth it was so hot in April often that they couldn’t bear a sheet on them. Her youth must have been almost the same time as my fathers. She is 9 years younger, I make out: born in 1841. And what did she see of Victorian England I wonder?

I can make up situations, but I cannot make up plots. That is: if I pass the lame girl, I can without knowing I do it, instantly make up a scene: (now I cant think of one). This is the germ of such fictitious gift as I have. And by the way I get letter after letter about my books, & they scarcely please me.

Further, we met Mary & Barbara [Hutchinson] in Brighton yesterday; grey, tailor made, elegant, with a touch of pink, & pink silk legs. Yet I fancied some wrinkles about Mary’s eyes; & a sharp line or two, made by Clive. We were affable, as people are when they meet after a coolness; we gave them buns. We were extra affable, perhaps; & the shadow of Clive loomed above us. Going to fetch L.’s hat from Charleston I chanced on one of those evening autumn emotional hours when people want to be intimate, perhaps to boast. And he told me an absurd romantic story—of a girl, lovely, desired, half his age; & how she loved him, & he could not believe it; she must think me a cultivated elderly man, he said; & so “I try I try to control myself” but, wondrously, they went off the other day; had 4 days perfect bliss; & now “the drama begins”. That is, it began two days ago, on Monday. Nobody has the least idea who she is. And is it lasting, or genuine, or only a set off against Mary? & will it survive Mary’s attacks, & shall we be dragged in, & so on & so on? Those are the thoughts which agitate us this October, which is the birth of the year.

If my pen allowed, I should now try to make out a work table, having done my last article for the Tribune, & now being free again. And instantly the usual exciting devices enter my mind: a biography beginning in the year 1500 & continuing to the present day, called Orlando: Vita; only with a change about from one sex to another. I think, for a treat, I shall let myself dash this in for a week, while [text ends]"
1927.10.22,"This is a book, I think I have said before, which I write after tea. And my brain was full of ideas, but I have spent them on Mr Ashcroft & Miss Findlater, fervent admirers.

“I shall let myself dash this in for a week”—I have done nothing, nothing, nothing else for a fortnight; & am launched somewhat furtively but with all the more passion upon Orlando: A Biography. It is to be a small book, & written by Christmas. I thought I could combine it with Fiction, but once the mind gets hot it cant stop; I walk making up phrases; sit contriving scenes; am in short in the thick of the greatest rapture known to me; from which I have kept myself since last February, or earlier. Talk of planning a book, or waiting for an idea! This one came in a rush; I said to pacify myself, being bored & stale with criticism & faced with that intolerable dull Fiction, “You shall write a page of a story for a treat: you shall stop sharp at 11.30 & then go on with the Romantics”. I had very little idea what the story was to be about. But the relief of turning my mind that way about was such that I felt happier than for months; as if put in the sun, or laid on cushions; & after two days entirely gave up my time chart & abandoned myself to the pure delight of this farce: which I enjoy as much as I’ve ever enjoyed anything; & have written myself into half a headache & had to come to a halt, like a tired horse, & take a little sleeping draught last night: which made our breakfast fiery. I did not finish my egg. I am writing Orlando half in a mock style very clear & plain, so that people will understand every word. But the balance between truth & fantasy must be careful. It is based on Vita, Violet Trefusis, Lord Lascelles, Knole &c.

A great many incidents to record. They come always in a rush together, these bright October days, with every one just back, fresh from solitude, cheerful, busy, sociable. Nessa has initiated, informally, Sunday evenings; & there Old Bloomsbury is to gather, after dinner—Helen Clive Roger & so on.

Then I asked the time in the Press a week ago.

“Leonard can tell you” said Angus very huffily.

“Ask Angus. I dont seem to know” said Leonard very grumpy. And I saw Mrs C. lower her head over her typing & laugh. This was the tail of a terrific quarrel about the time between them. Angus was dismissed; but tells Nessa he wants to stay, could tempers be made compatible. A bad year, this, financially, for the Press: yet prospects seem flourishing, if only Marys & Braithwaites didn’t eat up all profits. Dottie (who comes to tea with great simplicity, but sits a little long afterwards) is investing her £200 a year in Stella Gibbons &c. & lends me her own poems, which I promptly throw down the W.C. Vita stalks into the press, all red & black (so is Orlando) says Lizzie [a dog?] has been shot by a farmer, no, a publican (she respects farmers, not publicans): comes up here with me, & Harold drops in to say Good bye. We sit very cosy & intimate for all his man about the worldiness, over the gas: he has just been to the Foreign Office & they have been “ever so good. Really they spoil one” he said, being devoted to the Office, which now sends him to Berlin for 3 years. Vita will only go for a short time she says. She likes him. She pets him: wants me to make him a fresh cup of tea.

Then there’s Clive. He has laid his stairs with the vividest green, 5 inches thick: has every comfort & convenience. I dine there to meet Harold & Tom: Tom, of course, in white waistcoat, much the man of the world; which sets the key, & off they go telling stories about ‘Jean’ (Cocteau) about Ada Leverson, Gosse, Valery, &c. &c. & L. & I feel a little Bloomsburyish perhaps; no, I think this sort of talk is hardly up to the scratch. Harold does it best. He was in Petersburg when they blew up Stolypin, or his children; can describe the boom bum bum of a bomb falling from the life: & the Empress with her yellow eye whites; & King George throwing Mr Britling with a violence to the floor. & I ‘may be lacking in distinction but I’m damned if I’m an alien’ was his comment on some phrase of Wells’.

And that reminds me how we saw the pale dove grey coffin of Mrs Wells slide through the gates at Golders Green. It had tassels like bell pulls on it. Wells sat in bottle blue overcoat by [George Bernard] Shaw, sobbing. One saw his white handkerchief going in & out of his pocket. Mr Page a shaggy shabby old scholar, read some typewritten sheets, by Wells, about “our friend Caroline.” “Poor things, poor silly things she’d say, in their days of ill repute. This colloquialism merged in the burial service; & somehow the whole effect was a little nondescript. The aim was to emphasise life; & generosity & how generous lives continue; one thing touched me. “Some are set on a headland & their lives are a beacon to mankind. Others live retired & are hardly known; but their lives are the most precious” which reminds me of what my father wrote, & meant at the moment, of my mother. Then the coffin slid away “into the furnace of material creation”. She had become part of the roses she loved, & of the sun on snow. Poor Jane! It was desperate to see what a dowdy shabby imperfect lot we looked; how feeble; how ugly for the most part. And yet we were doing our best to say something sincere about our great adventure (as Wells almost called it). And he has been adventurous & plunged about in his bath & splashed the waters, to give him his due. Afterwards we stood about congratulating; Lydia sobbed; Shaw said “You mustnt cry. Jane is well—Jane is splendid” & we went off—I to Fortnum & Mason’s to buy shoes."
1927.11.20,"I will now snatch a moment from what Morgan calls ‘life’ to enter a hurried note. My notes have been few; life a cascade, a glissade, a torrent: all together. I think on the whole this is our happiest autumn. So much work; & success now; & life on easy terms: heaven knows what. My morning rushes, pell mell, from 10 to 1. I write so quick I can’t get it typed before lunch. This I suppose is the main backbone of my autumn—Orlando. Never do I feel this, except for a morning or two, writing criticism. Today I began the third chapter. Do I learn anything? Too much of a joke perhaps for that; yet I like these plain sentences; & the externality of it for a change. It is too thin of course; splashed over the canvas; but I shall cover the ground by Jan. 7th (I say) & then re-write.

Vita comes; Dottie comes; Clive incessant; Tom; Roger; we have our Bloomsbury evenings; for the first time I have been spending money, on a bed, on a coat (the coat, at the moment, I regret) & had a delicious sense of affluence the other day when at Long Barn I tipped Loune [the butler] 5/- for a nights lodging. But the money psychology is odd; & that it doesn’t give me enormous pleasure to spend. I doubt that I want anything eno’; yet worry about spending wrongly; & must buy an evening dress which worries me too. I have refused Sibyl; accepted Ethel. Fame increases; I think. Young men write about me in their absurd random books. Domestic life, Nelly that is, good as gold.

This is a summary; for I have too many letters to write, & cant catch that cloud which was so heavy in my brain when I sat down.

I made Vita cry the other night; quietly, unself-consciously. “I hate being bored” I said, of her Campbells & Valery Taylors; & this she thought meant I should be tired of her."
1927.11.30,"I have just been upstairs & tried on a hat (18/11) which I have just bought at B&H (so they call it) [Bourne & Hollingsworth, Oxford Street] to wear at Sibyl’s lunch party tomorrow. With that money I could have bought a nightgown. Then I heard a man in a bus talk about quality & state of gentlemaness; & you would call me Sir; as I you Madam. This to a working woman, dowdy pasty plush with a baby. “Had more’n 8” she said to the conductor; whom she called young man; & he called her Ma. This is Dickens; or Shakespeare; or simple English cockney: whichever it is I adore it; & warm the cockles of my heart at it.

A very happy autumn this, I repeat. Nelly raised £5, & for that reason or another in constant spirits & kindness. Offered last night to clear away. She thinks it only fair, as we’ve raised her. No trouble about people coming. After Xmas discontent will set in no doubt; when must write criticism; the light languishes; Nessa Vita Clive are all away, But I will steal a march on that depression. Moreover, aren’t I proud at the moment. Ruth Draper admires me: I am to meet her on Friday at Elena Richmonds. What an incredible concatenation! So tonight I go to the Pit to see Ruth Draper. Lunch with Sibyl; dine with Ethel; & a new dress, made from one 100 years old. These are the little waves that life makes; which keep us tossing & going up & down on top of them."
1927.12.01,"A rapid note about the lunch party, L. dining at the Cranium.

An art of light talk; about people. Bogey Harris; Maurice Baring. B.H. ‘knows’ everyone: that is no one. Freddy Fossle? Oh yes I know him; knows Ly So & So; knows everyone: cant admit to not knowing. A polished, burnished diner out. Roman Catholic. In the middle M. Baring says—But Lady Beaverbrook died this morning. Sibyl says Say that again. But BM. [?] was lunching with her yesterday, says Bogey. Well its in the papers: she’s dead says M.B. Sibyl says But she was quite young. Lord Ivor asked me to meet the young man her daughter’s to marry. I know Lord Ivor says, or wd say Bogey. Well its odd, says Sibyl, giving up the attempt to wrestle with the death of the young at a lunch party. So on to wigs: Lady Charlie used to have hers curled by a sailor on deck before she got up says Bogey. Oh I’ve known her all my life. Went yatchting with them. Lady … eyebrows fell into the soup. Sir John Cook was so fat they had to hike him up. Once he got out of bed in the middle of the night & fell on the floor where he lay 5 hours—couldn’t move. BM. sent me a pear by the waiter with a long letter. Talk of houses & periods. All very smooth & surface talk: depends on knowing people: not on saying anything interesting. Bogey’s cheeks are polished daily."
1927.12.20,"This is almost the shortest day & perhaps the coldest night of the year. We are in the black heart of a terrific frost. I notice that look of black atoms in a clear air, which for some reason I can never describe to my liking. The pavement was white with great powdery flakes the other night, walking back with Roger & Helen; this was from Nessa’s last Sunday—last, I fear, for many a month. But I have as usual ‘no time’: let me count the things I should be doing this deep winters night with Leonard at his last lecture, & Pinker asleep in his chair. I should be reading Bagenal’s story; Julian’s play; Lord Chesterfield’s letters; & writing to Hubert [Henderson] (about a cheque from the Nation). There is an irrational scale of values in my mind which puts these duties higher than mere scribbling.

Angus is finally to go: we had another semi-painful interview in the Studio; when he interrupted L.’s dismissal with his own resignation. Not enough money. We think of Francis Birrell as partner; shall ask him tomorrow; & broach the Hogarth Miscellany.

This flashed to my mind at Nessa’s children’s party last night. The little creatures acting moved my infinitely sentimental throat. Angelica so mature, & composed; all grey & silver; such an epitome of all womanliness; & such an unopened bud of sense & sensibility; wearing a grey wig & a sea coloured dress. And yet oddly enough I scarcely want children of my own now. This insatiable desire to write something before I die, this ravaging sense of the shortness & feverishness of life, make me cling, like a man on a rock, to my one anchor. I don’t like the physicalness of having children of one’s own. This occurred to me at Rodmell; but I never wrote it down. I can dramatise myself as parent, it is true. And perhaps I have killed the feeling instinctively; as perhaps nature does.

I am still writing the 3rd Chap. of Orlando. I have had of course to give up the fancy of finishing by February & printing this spring. It is drawing out longer than I meant. I have just been thinking over the scene when O. meets a girl (Nell) in the Park & goes with her to a neat room in Gerrard Street. There she will disclose herself. They will talk. This will lead to a diversion or two about women’s love. This will bring in O.’s night life; & her clients (thats the word). Then she will see Dr Johnson, & perhaps write (I want somehow to quote it) To all you Ladies. So I shall get some effect of years passing; & then there will be a description of the lights of the 18th Century burning; & the clouds of the 19th Century rising. Then on to the 19th. But I have not considered this. I want to write it all over hastily, & so keep unity of tone, which in this book is very important. It has to be half laughing, half serious: with great splashes of exaggeration.

Perhaps I shall pluck up courage to ask the Times for a rise. But could I write for my Annual I would never write for another paper. How extraordinarily unwilled by me but potent in its own right by the way Orlando was! as if it shoved everything aside to come into existence. Yet I see looking back just now to March that it is almost exactly in spirit, though not in actual facts, the book I planned then as an escapade; the spirit to be satiric, the structure wild. Precisely.

Yes, I repeat, a very happy, a singularly happy autumn.

Facts are: Clive is loved by a lady in Leicestershire: Mary loves (perhaps) Lord A. She wishes to have Clive back on terms. He forgets: has a twinge now & then, but is fancy free. Mary met them walking in Cavendish Square. Raymond will marry Valery, (so we think)."
1927.12.22,"I just open this for a moment, being dull of the head, to enter a severe reprimand of myself to myself. The value of society is that it snubs one. I am meretricious, mediocre; a humbug; am getting into the habit of flashy talk. Tinsel it seemed last night at the Keynes. I was out of humour & so could see the transparency of my own sayings. Dadie said a true thing too: when V. lets her style get on top of her, one thinks only of that; when she uses clichés, one thinks what she means. But, he says, I have no logical power & live & write in an opium dream. And the dream is too often about myself.

Now with middle age drawing on, & age ahead it is important to be severe on such faults. So easily might I become a hare brained egotistic woman, exacting compliments, arrogant, narrow, withered. Nessa’s children (I always measure myself against her, & find her much the largest, most humane of the two of us, think of her now with an admiration that has no envy in it: with some trace of the old childish feeling that we were in league together against the world; & how proud I am of her triumphant winning of all our battles: as she [battles?] her way so nonchalantly modestly, almost anonymously past the goal, with her children round her; & only a little added tenderness (a moving thing in her) which shows me that she too feels wonder surprise at having passed so many terrors & sorrows safe—

The dream is too often about myself. To correct this, & to forget one’s own sharp absurd little personality, reputation & the rest of it, one should read; see outsiders; think more; write more logically; above all be full of work; & practise anonymity. Silence in company; or the quietest statement, not the showiest, is also ‘indicated’ as the doctors say. It was an empty party, rather, last night. Very nice here, though; & F.B. is I think willing."
1928.01.17,"In half an hour or so Nessa & Duncan will look in on their way to Roger’s to say good bye. This is the true break in the year: Bloomsbury is dispersed today till May, I suppose. Clive was off to Germany this morning.

Yesterday we went to Hardy’s funeral. What did I think of? Of Max Beerbohm’s letter, just read; or a lecture to the Newnhamites about women’s writing. At intervals some emotion broke in. But I doubt the capacity of the human animal for being dignified in ceremony. One catches a Bishops frown & twitch: sees his polished shiny nose; suspects the rapt spectacled young priest gazing at the cross he carries, of being a humbug; catches Robert Lynd’s distracted haggard eye; then thinks of the mediocrity of Squire; next here is the coffin, an overgrown one; like a stage coffin, covered with a white satin cloth: bearers elderly gentlemen rather red & stiff, holding to the corners: pigeons flying outside; insufficient artificial light; procession to poets corner; dramatic “In sure & certain hope of immortality” perhaps melodramatic. After dinner at Clive’s Lytton protested that the great man’s novels are the poorest of poor stuff; & can’t read them. Lytton sitting or lying inert, with his eyes shut, or exasperated with them open. Lady Strachey slowly fading, but it may take years. Over all this broods for me, some uneasy sense, of change, & mortality, & how partings are deaths; & then a sense of my own fame—why should this come over me?—& then of its remoteness; & then the pressure of writing two articles on Meredith & furbishing up the Hardy. And Leonard sitting at home reading. And Max’s letter. & a sense of the futility of it all."
1928.02.11,"I am so cold I can hardly hold the pen. The futility of it all—so I broke off; & have indeed been feeling that rather persistently, or perhaps I should have written here. Hardy & Meredith together sent me torpid to bed with headache. I know the feeling now, when I can’t spin a sentence, & sit mumbling & turning; & nothing flits by my brain which is as a blank window. So I shut my studio door, & go to bed, stuffing my ears with rubber; & there I lie a day or two. And what leagues I travel in the time! Such ‘sensations’ spread over my spine & head directly I give them the chance; such an exaggerated tiredness; such anguishes & despairs; & heavenly relief & rest; & then misery again. Never was anyone so tossed up & down by the body as I am, I think. But it is over: & put away; & Lord Sackville is dead & lies at Withyam, & I passed Knole with Vita yesterday & had to look away from the vast masterless house, without a This is what she minds most. When she left the house behind the old cart horses, she went for ever, she said, after complete rule for three days.

For some reason, I am hacking rather listlessly at the last chapter of Orlando, which was to have been the best. Always always the last chapter slips out of my hands. One gets bored. One whips oneself up. I still hope for a fresh wind, & dont very much bother, except that I miss the fun, which was so tremendously lively all October, November & December. I have my doubts if it is not empty; & too fantastic to write at such length.

For the rest, Bloomsbury today revives. Clive is back: whereupon Mary asks us to lunch: & so we return to some flicker of the snowdrop pallor of very early spring.

My pen protests. This writing is nonsense, it says. And L. is with M⁠[argaret] Ll⁠[ewelyn]. D⁠[avies]. Pinker has the lice. [Several ink blots.]"
1928.02.18,"I am happy to say I have still a few pounds in the Bank, & my own cheque book too. This great advance in dignity was made in the autumn. Out of my £60 I have bought a Heal bed; a cupboard, a fur coat, & now a strip of carpet for the hall. This financial revision has been a great success. And I pan out articles so as to write one & earn £30 a month. And I should be revising Lord Chesterfield at this moment, but I’m not. My mind is woolgathering away about Women & Fiction, which I am to read at Newnham in May. The mind is the most capricious of insects—flitting fluttering. I had thought to write the quickest most brilliant pages in Orlando yesterday—not a drop came, all, forsooth, for the usual physical reasons, which declared themselves today. It is the oddest feeling: as if a finger stopped the flow of the ideas in the brain: it is unsealed, & the blood rushes all over the place. Again, instead of writing O. I’ve been racing up & down the whole field of my lecture. And tomorrow, alas, we motor; for I must get back into the book—which has brightened the last few days satisfactorily. Not that my sensations in writing are an infallible guide.

We dined with Ka. She had unshaded all Nessa’s lamps, & somehow commonplaced the house strangely. It was full too of those derelicts whom she collects—the earnest, the ugly, the unhappy. Never have I sat next such driftwood as Mrs Campbell. Garnett was as bad—an overeducated prig. So tired I cant talk—three large committees this afternoon—gave accurate information about cooking eggs.

Before that, there was Todd & Clive—Clive is ubiquitous. Todd like some primeval animal emerging from the swamp, muddy, hirsute. A woman who is commercial—rather an exception in my world. She spoke of “getting my money back” as Gerald Duckworth might have spoken with the same look of rather hostile & cautious greed, as though the world were banded to rob her. This money-grubbing way is not attractive; but it is lightened by a shimmer of dash & ‘chic’ even. She stands on her two feet as she expresses it. She is starting a paper—I’m so bored with people starting papers in May! There’s Desmond for another. But Todd has none of his bubble & gush. She finds work very dull. She likes life. [Six words omitted] flirting with Osbert I presume. She is tapir like, & the creatures nose snuffs pertinaciously after Bloomsbury.

Dadie came in for a moment, rather drawn & white, ‘making money’ too. We are a little out of that, Leonard & I: L. never makes a penny; I mean tries to: & I could almost wish we were more lavish in our ways. This is occasionally in my thoughts. And what else is? I doubt that I shall ever write another novel after O. I shall invent a new name for them.

Lunch with Mary; lunch with Clive; dinner with Clive; tea with Jane, raised in bed, with her old white head lifted up, on pillows, very aged & rather exalted, able only to talk or listen for 10 minutes or so. Mary & Jack simmering with polished domestic affluence & prettiness: gay bunches everywhere; & paint, & carpets; but not much backing to it. Jack develops, before 3 strikes, the storytelling manner: by 3.30 all the stories are told. Home to shabbiness."
1928.03.18,"I have lost my writing board; an excuse for the anaemic state of this book. Indeed I only write now, in between letters, to say that Orlando was finished yesterday as the clock struck one. Anyhow the canvas is covered. There will be three months of close work needed, imperatively, before it can be printed; for I have scrambled & splashed, & the canvas shows through in a thousand places. But it is a serene, accomplished feeling, to write, even provisionally, The End, & we go off on Saturday, with my mind appeased.

I have written this book quicker than any: & it is all a joke; & yet gay & quick reading I think; a writers holiday. I feel more & more sure that I will never write a novel again. Little bits of rhyme come in. So we go motoring across France on Saturday, & shall be back on April 17th for the summer. Time flies—oh yes: that summer should be here again; & I still have the faculty of wonder at it. The world swinging round again & bringing its green & blue close to ones eyes.

Since February I have been a little clouded with headache, had a touch of influenza; & so, with the lights down, & all energy turned to forcing my book along, have not written here. I dislike these months. Shall we try Rome next year? Control of life is what one should learn now: its economic management. I feel cautious, like a poor person, now I am 46. But I may be dead then, I think, & so take my French lessons now, instead of waiting."
1928.03.22,"There are the last pages at the end of Orlando, & it is twenty five minutes to one; & I have written everything I have to write, & on Saturday we go abroad.

Yes its done—Orlando—begun on 8th October, as a joke; & now rather too long for my liking. It may fall between stools, be too long for a joke, & too frivolous for a serious book. All this I dismiss from a mind avid only of green fields. The sun; wine; sitting doing nothing. I have been for the last 6 weeks rather a bucket than a fountain; sitting to be shot into by one person after another. A rabbit that passes across a shooting gallery, & one’s friends go pop-pop. Heaven be praised, Sibyl today puts us off, which leaves Dadie only, & a whole days solitude, please Heaven, tomorrow. But I intend to control this rabbit shooting business when I come back. And money making. I hope to settle in & write one nice little discreet article for £25 each month; & so live; without stress; & so read—what I want to read. At 46 one must be a miser; only have time for essentials.

But I think I have made moral reflections enough, & should describe people, save that, when seen so colourlessly, by duty not wish, one’s mind is a little slack in taking notes. Morgan & Desmond were here to tea. Morgan more of the blue butterfly than ever. Unless I talk, he says nothing. And any shadow sends him flitting. Desmond comes in, round as a billiard ball; & this is true of his dear bubbling lazy mind; which has such a glitter & lustre now from mere being at ease in the world that it puts me into a good temper to be with him. He describes, analyses, narrates; does not actually talk. All his blandishments are now active to get articles for “Life & Letters” which comes out in May. I am scarcely flattered now to be asked; yet of course dashed a little when I refuse Mrs van Doren’s £120 & she takes no notice. And a little dashed, too, not to get the Femina prize—partly because I’ve been exhibited as a competitor & people will think me dashed: which I’m not, innately.

Roger & Helen, Ka & Will, the other night. Roger malicious a little, & vain. “I am the most read critic in England, & yet I have nowhere to write.” Analysed, this amounts to the fact that The Nation only pays him £5, & Konody gets more, & the pages of the Burlington are more thumbed at his articles than at MacColl’s. There is an innocence in this vanity which is likeable; but I am touchy for the reputation of Bloomsbury. I thought I could see Ka & Will comparing us, & being glad we were not impeccable. They compare us with the political world: we them with our own. Will lay with his eyes shut, & I was rather sorry for him. He knows what Roger thinks of his pictures, & what I don’t think—for I dont look at them; but he has the generosity to praise my books. We middleaged people now scarcely covet each others good opinion very seriously: are content to be different.

Watery blowy weather; & this time next week we shall be in the middle of France."
1928.04.17,"Home again, as foretold, last night, & to settle the dust in my mind, write here. We have been across France & back—every inch of that fertile field traversed by the admirable Singer. And now towns & spires & scenes begin to rise in my mind as the rest sinks. I see Chartres in particular, the snail, with its head straight, marching across the flat country, the most distinguished of churches. The rose window is like a jewel on black velvet. The outside is very intricate yet simple; elongated; somehow preserved from the fantastic & ornate. Grey weather dashed all over this; & I remember coming in at night in the wet often, & hearing the rain in hotels. Often I was bobbing up & down on my two glasses of vin du pays.

It was rather a rush & a cram—as these jumbled notes testify. Once we were high up on a mountain in a snow storm; & rather afraid of a long tunnel. Twenty miles often cut us off from civilisation. One wet afternoon we punctured in a mountain village & I went in & sat with the family a nice scrupulous polite woman, a girl who was pretty, shy, had a friend called Daisy at Earlsfield. They caught trout & wild boars. Then on we went to Florae, where I found a book—Girardin’s memoirs in the old bookcase that had been sold with the house. Always some good food & hot bottles at night. And there was Nessa & Duncan & Clive (who smacked me in public—curse him for an uneasy little upstart.) Oh & my prize—£40 from the French. And Julian. And one or two hot days & the Pont du Garde in the sun; & Les Beaux (this is where Dante got his idea of Hell Duncan said) & mounting all the time steadily was my desire for words, till I envisaged a sheet of paper & pen & ink as something of miraculous desirability—could even relish the scratch as if it were a divine kind of relief to me—And there was St Remy & the ruins in the sun. I forget now how it all went—how thing fitted to thing; but the eminences now emerge, & I noticed how, talking to Raymond at The Nation this afternoon we had already pitched on the high points. Before that, crossing the graveyard in the bitter windy rain, we saw Hope & a dark cultivated woman. But on they went past us, with the waver of an eye. Next moment I heard Virginia, & turned & there was Hope coming back—“Jane died yesterday” she murmured, half asleep, talking distraught, ‘out of herself.’ We kissed by Cromwell’s daughter’s grave, where Shelley used to walk, for Jane’s death. She lay dead outside the graveyard in that back room where we saw her lately raised on her pillows, like a very old person, whom life has tossed up, & left; exalted, satisfied, exhausted. Hope the colour of dirty brown paper. Then to the office, then home to work here; & now to work & work, as hard as I can."
1928.04.21,"A bitter windy rainy day. There is no blue, no red, no green in this detestable spring. Furs are in the shops. I have walked across the Park with Leonard; come home; find the char in the studio; must write here instead of making, as I had meant, some carefully polished sentences—for Orlando is to tell the truth, damned rough.

Life is either too empty or too full. Happily, I never cease to transmit these curious damaging shocks. At 46 I am not callous; suffer considerably; make good resolutions—still feel as experimental & on the verge of getting at the truth as ever. Oh & Vita—to change the subject & take up the burden of facts—has had a stupendous row with her mother—in the course of which she was made to take the pearl necklace from her neck, cut it in two with a pocket knife, deliver over the 12 central pearls, put the relics, all running loose, in an envelope the solicitor gave her. Thief, liar, I hope you’ll be killed by an omnibus—so ‘my honoured Lady Sackville’ adressed her, trembling with rage in the presence of a secretary & a solicitor & a Chauffeur. The woman is said to be mad. Vita very gallant & wild & tossing her head & taking me to the Zoo & saying she was wild & free & wd. make her money now herself by writing.

And I find myself again in the old driving whirlwind of writing against time. Have I ever written with it? But I vow I wont spend longer at Orlando, which is a freak; it shall come out in September, though the perfect artist would revoke & rewrite & polish—infinitely. But hours remain over to be filled with reading something or other—I’m not sure what. What sort of summer do I desire? Now that I have 16 pounds to spend before July 1st (on our new system) I feel freer: can afford a dress or a hat, & so may go about, a little, if I want. And yet the only exciting life is the imaginary one. Once I get the wheels spinning in my head, I dont want money much, or dress, or even a cupboard, a bed at Rodmell or a sofa.

Dined with Lydia & Maynard: two couples, elderly, childless distinguished. He & she both urbane & admirable. Grey comes at Maynard’s temples. He is finer looking now: not with us pompous or great: simple, with his mind working always, on Russian, Bolshevists, glands, genealogies; always the proof of a remarkable mind when it overflows thus vigorously into byepaths. There are two royal stocks in England he says from which all intellect descends. He will work this out as if his fortune depended on it. Lydia is composed, & controlled. She says very sensible things.

We went, also, to Jane’s funeral, getting ‘there’ (somewhere out of the world where buses pass only one every 15 minutes), just as the service ended; marching into the church clamorously; but it was only barely full of the dingiest people; cousins I fancy from the North, very drab: the only male relation afflicted, with a bubbly chin, a stubbly beard, & goggly eyes. Distinguished people drag up such queer chains of family when they die. They had hired Daimlers too, which succeeded the coffin at a foots pace. We walked to the grave; the clergyman, a friend, waited for the dismal company to collect; then read some of the lovelier, more rational parts of the Bible; & said, by heart, Abide with me. The gravedigger had given him, surreptitiously, a handful of clay, which he divided into three parts & dropped at the right moments. A bird sang most opportunely; with a gay indifference, & if one liked, hope, that Jane would have enjoyed. Then the incredibly drab female cousins advanced, each with a fat bunch of primroses & dropped them in; & we also advanced & looked down at the coffin at the bottom of a very steep brazen looking grave—But tho’ L. almost cried, I felt very little—only the beauty of the Come unto me all ye that are weary; but as usual the obstacle of not believing dulled & bothered me. Who is ‘God’ & what the Grace of Christ? & what did they mean to Jane?

Raymond to tea—two hours animated admirable light & airy & well seasoned talk, about facts mostly: ghosts; consciousness; novels: not people much. But he has his shirts made of figured tablecloths, shiny, hard.

And what am I to read? Pinker is back. And Leonard having tea with his mother. And perhaps the old woman has sighed herself through my room, & I can go down & do that typing, & write to the little man who smacks me in public & appeals for my pity—Clive I mean."
1928.04.24,"Waiting for Gumbo [Marjorie Strachey]—how I hate waiting for anybody! Can’t settle, read, think—so I write: an odd tribute to the uses I put this diary to. And I should be typing O. in the basement. Must now do 10 pages daily till June 1st. Well, I like being an ass on a mill round.

In from the triumph of buying a dress & a coat for about 5.10. What one must do is to face the girl with one’s naked kindly searching eye: speak firmly; ask for a looking glass & study effects. Then they quail, under powder & paint. A lovely soaring summer day this: winter sent howling home to his arctic. I was reading Othello last night, & was impressed by the volley & volume & tumble of his words: too many I should say, were I reviewing for the Times. He put them in when tension was slack. In the great scenes, everything fits like a glove. The mind tumbles & splashes among words when it is not being urged on: I mean, the mind of a very great master of words who is writing with one hand. He abounds. The lesser writers stint. As usual, impressed by Shre. But my mind is very bare to words—English words—at the moment: they hit me, hard, I watch them bounce & spring. I’ve read only French for 4 weeks. An idea comes to me for an article on French; what we know of it."
1928.05.04,"And now theres the Femina prize to record before I go off this brilliant summer day to tea with Miss Jenkins in Doughty Street. I am going dutifully, not to snub the female young. But I shall be overpowering I doubt not. But it is a wonderful day.

The prize was an affair of dull stupid horror: a function; not alarming; stupefying. Hugh Walpole saying how much he disliked my books; rather, how much he feared for his own. Little Miss Robins, like a red breast, creeping out. I remember your mother—the most beautiful Madonna & at the same time the most complete woman of the world. Used to come & see me in my flat (I see this as a summer visit on a hot day). She never confided. She would suddenly say something so unexpected, from that Madonna face, one thought it vicious. This I enjoyed: nothing else made much impression. Afterwards there was the horror of having looked ugly in cheap black clothes. I cannot control this complex. I wake at dawn with a start. Also the ‘fame’ is becoming vulgar & a nuisance. It means nothing; & yet takes one’s time. Americans perpetually. Croly; Gaige; offers:

We have seen an endless number of people—Eddie, Lytton, Miss Ritchie, Francis, Vita,—& now the minute Jenkins."
1928.05.31,"No I cannot read Proust at the moment—

Leonard is reading Orlando, which goes to the printer tomorrow. It is very quiet at the moment. Whitsun is over. We were at Rodmell & saw the races, where the marsh used to be. And our field is sold to Allinson—who is going to build. And what then? I have no brain left over to think with. And Leonard is arguing in the basement with Dadie. What can it be about? Pinker is asleep in the chair. Angelica comes back tomorrow. I feel a kind of drought caused by the lack of Nessa, & ask how shall I manage if we are apart 6 months, not only 4? But my creed is to batter down opposition. I have seen—

I daresay a good many people, Rose Macaulay, Rebecca West, Maurois flash to mind in a bunch last week, & Todd’s room; rather to her credit, workmanlike; Garland pear⁠[l]⁠hung & silken; Todd as buxom as a badger. Rebecca a hardened old reprobate I daresay, but no fool; & the whole atmosphere professional; no charm, except the rather excessive charm of Garland.

Clive’s book out—a very superficial one, L. says.

The sun is out again; I have half forgotten Orlando already, since L. has read it & it has half passed out of my possession. I think it lacks the sort of hammering I should have given it if I had taken longer: is too freakish & unequal. Very brilliant now & then. As for the effect of the whole, that I cant judge. Not, I think ‘important’ among my works. L. says a satire.

Gosse is dead, & I am half reconciled to him by they’re saying in the papers that he chose to risk a dangerous operation rather than be an invalid for life. This kind of vitality always gets me. But—lies otherwise flourish round his grave, & poor dear Desmond with 3 children to keep has to be as profuse of them as anybody.

We met him yesterday in Kingsway, just as I was thinking how I should describe him if I wrote a Memoir, as Molly insists. He loomed up as if my thought had made him visible. He gave me the first number of his paper.

Rose Macaulay says “Yes I won the prize”—rather peevishly. I think at once that she is jealous, & test whatever else she says with a view to finding out whether she is or not. About Colefax: “I’m the only one of all my friends who isn’t asked there.” About work: ‘I’ve got to work tomorrow’ I say, excusing myself for not going to Raymond’s party. “So have we all” rather sharply. & so on. This shows through a dozen little phrases, as we’re talking of America, articles &c: she is jealous of me; anxious to compare us: but I may imagine it: & it shows my own jealousy no doubt, as suspicions always do. One cdn’t know them if one hadn’t got them. And now to Angelica with a packet of bulls eyes. I am again beginning to read.

L. takes Orlando more seriously than I had expected. Thinks it in some ways better than The Lighthouse; about more interesting things, & with more attachment to life, & larger. The truth is I expect I began it as a joke, & went on with it seriously. Hence it lacks some unity. He says it is very original. Anyhow I’m glad to be quit this time of writing ‘a novel’; & hope never to be accused of it again. Now I want to write some very closely reasoned criticism; book on fiction; an essay of some sort (but not Tolstoy for the Times). Dr Burney’s evening party I think for Desmond. And then? I feel anxious to keep the hatch down: not to let too many projects come in. Something abstract poetic next time—I dont know. I rather like the idea of these Biographies of living people. Ottoline suggests herself—but no. And I must tear up all that manuscript, & write a great many notes & adventure out into the world—as I shall do tomorrow, when I go to have my ears pierced with Vita.

June weather. Still, bright, fresh. Owing to the Lighthouse (car) I dont feel so shut in London as usual, & can imagine the evening on some moor now, or in France without the envy I used to have, in London on a fine evening. Also London itself perpetually attracts, stimulates, gives me a play & a story & a poem, without any trouble, save that of moving my legs through the streets. I walked Pinker to Grays Inn Gardens this afternoon, & saw—Red Lion Square: Morris’es house; thought of them on winters evenings in the joties; thought we are just as interesting; saw the (street) Great Ormond St where a dead girl was found yesterday; saw & heard the Salvation Army making Xtianity gay for the people: a great deal of nudging & joking on the part of very unattractive young men & women; making it lively, I suppose; & yet, to be truthful, when I watch them I never laugh or criticise, but only feel how strange & interesting this is: wonder what they mean by ‘Come to the Lord.’ I daresay exhibitionism accounts for some of it: the applause of the gallery; this lures boys to sing hymns; & kindles shop boys to announce in a loud voice that they are saved. It is what writing for the Evening Standard is for Rose Macaulay & I was going to say myself: but so far I have not done it."
1928.06.20,"So sick of Orlando I can write nothing. I have corrected the proofs in a week; & cannot spin another phrase. I detest my own volubility. Why be always spouting words? Also I have almost lost the power of reading. Correcting proofs 5, 6, or 7 hours a day, writing in this & that meticulously, I have bruised my reading faculty severely. Take up Proust after dinner & put him down. This is the worst time of all. It makes me suicidal. Nothing seems left to do. All seems insipid & worthless. Now I will watch & see how I resurrect. I think I shall read something—say a life of Goethe. Then I shall visit about. Mercifully, Nessa is back. My earth is watered again. I go back to words of one syllable: feel come over me the feathery change: rather true that: as if my physical body put on some soft comfortable, skin. She is a necessity to me—as I am not to her. I run to her as the wallaby runs to the old kangaroo. She is also very cheerful, solid, happy. The trifles that annoy other people, she passes off; as if her happiness were a million or two in the bank. And how masterfully she controls her dozen lives; never in a muddle, or desperate, or worried; never spending a pound or a thought needlessly; yet with it all free, careless, airy, indifferent: a very notable achievement.

Julian dines with us tonight to meet Miss Sylva Norman whom I fetched up from complete nonentity on the telephone last night. Another marvel of science. There she was in 10 minutes after we thought of her saying she would LOVE to come. Julian is a vast fat powerful sweet tempered engaging young man, into whose arms I let myself fall, half sister, half mother, & half (but arithmetic denies this) the mocking stirring contemporary friend. Mercifully Julian has his instincts sane & normal: has a wide forehead, & considerable address & competence in the management of life. But my tooth is aching. They will dine with us; & that is what I am ripe for—to go adventuring on the streams of other peoples lives—speculating, adrift"
1928.06.22,"So far I wrote & was interrupted—always interrupted; am now off to Ruislip with Pinker to wed her, & it is"
1928.07.07,"& a Saturday morning, very hot & fine.

All last night I dreamt of Katherine Mansfield & wonder what dreams are; often evoke so much more emotion, than thinking does—almost as if she came back in person & was outside one, actively making one feel; instead of a figment called up & recollected, as she is, now, if I think of her. Yet some emotion lingers on the day after a dream; even though I’ve now almost forgotten what happened in the dream, except that she was lying on a sofa in a room high up, & a great many sad faced women were round her. Yet somehow I got the feel of her, & of her as if alive again, more than by day.

At Long Barn yesterday, a good rather happy visit. I’m interested by the gnawing down of strata in friendship; how one passes unconsciously to different terms; takes things easier; dont mind at all hardly about dress or anything; scarcely feel it an exciting atmosphere, which, too, has its drawback from the “fizzing” point of view: yet is saner, perhaps deeper. Lay by the black currant bushes lecturing Vita on her floundering habits with the Campbells for instance. Mrs C. beat by her husband, all because V. will come triumphing, with her silver & her coronets & her footmen into the life of a herring-cooker. She cooks herrings on a gas stove, I said, always remembering my own phrases.

But having thus scrambled in a page, I must go—& yet want to stay & write about Sterne.

Monks House

Rodmell."
1928.08.08,"Eddy has just gone, leaving me the usual feeling: why is not human intercourse more definite, tangible: why aren’t I left holding a small round substance, say of the size of a pea, in my hand; something I can put in a box & look at? There is so little left. Yet these people one sees are fabric only made once in the world; these contacts we have are unique; & if E. were, say killed tonight, nothing definite would happen to me; yet his substance is never again to be repeated. Our meeting is—but the thread of this idea slips perpetually; constantly though it recurs, with sadness, to my mind: how little our relationships matter; & yet they are so important: in him, in me, something to him, to me, infinitely sentient, of the highest vividness, reality. But if I died tonight, he too would continue. Something illusory then enters into all that part of life. I am so important to myself: yet of no importance to other people: like the shadow passing over the downs. I deceive myself into thinking that I am important to other people: that makes part of my extreme vividness to myself: as a matter of fact, I dont matter; & so part of my vividness is unreal; gives me a sense of illusion. Eddy says he thinks “What impression am I making?” constantly & is agitated: as a matter of fact, he is probably making no impression: his agitation is about nothing: he is mistaken.

But, superficially speaking—for fundamentally I was thinking a thousand other thoughts; his presence was only I suppose a light on the surface of my mind—something green or iron-coloured or grey—while the water itself rushed on, in its old fierce way—thoughts about my writing; & about old age; & about buying the field (we bought it this morning) & about the children being noisy; & if I had bought Southease. All this went on sub-cutaneously. Yet his presence somehow checked the flow of sub-cutaneous life. I was always having to think what comes next? How am I to break into this other life which is 6 inches off mine in the deck chair in the orchard? So that my own thoughts could not flow deep or rapid, as they are doing now that Eddy is on his way to Tunbridge Wells. And what remains of Eddy is now in some ways more vivid, though more transparent, all of him composing itself in my mind, all I could get of him, & making itself a landscape appropriate to it; making a work of art for itself.

I am, as I write, wherever I come to a stop, looking out of the lodge window, at our field; & the little cottage boys with the cursed shrill voices, playing cricket half way down it; & as usual I am sentimental & worried. Children playing: yes, & interrupting me; yes & I have no children of my own; & Nessa has; & yet I dont want them any more, since my ideas so possess me; & I detest more & more interruption; & the slow heaviness of physical life, & almost dislike peoples bodies, I think, as I grow older; & want always to cut that short, & get my utmost fill of the marrow, of the essence.

I write thus partly in order to slip the burden of writing narrative, as for instance; we came here a fortnight ago. And we lunched at Charleston & Vita came & we were offered the field & we went to see the farm at Lime Kiln. Yet no doubt I shall be more interested, come 10 years, in facts; & shall want, as I do when I read, to be told details, details, so that I may look up from the page & arrange them too, into one of those makings up which seem so much truer done thus, from heaps of nonassorted facts, than now I can make them, when it is almost immediately being done (by me) under my eyes. It was a fine day, last Monday I rather think; & we drove through Ripe; & there was a girl & her feller at the gate in a narrow lane; & we had to interrupt them to turn the motor. I thought how the things they had been saying were dammed, like a river, by our interruption; & they stood there half amused, yet impatient, telling us to go to the left, but the road was up. They were glad when we went; yet gave us a flash of interest. Who are these people in their motor car: where are they going?—& then this sunk beneath the mind, & they forgot us completely. We went on. And then we reached the farm. The oasts had umbrella spokes poking out at the top: all was so ruined & faded. The Tudor farm house was almost blind; very small eyebrowed windows; old Stuart farmers must have peered out over the flat land, very dirty, ill-kempt, like people in slums. But they had dignity: at least thick walls; fireplaces; & solidity whereas now the house is lived in by one old, weedy pink faced man, who flung himself in his armchair. Go where you like—go anywhere, he said, loose jointed, somehow decayed, like the hop oasts; & damp like the mildewed carpets, & sordid, like the beds with the pots sticking out under them. The walls were sticky; the furniture mid Victorian; little light came through. It was all dying, decaying; & he had been there 50 years, & it will drop to pieces, since there is not enough beauty or strength to make anyone repair it."
1928.08.12,"Shall I now continue this soliloquy, or shall I imagine an audience, which will make me describe?

This sentence is due to the book on fiction which I am now writing—once more, O once more. It is a hand to mouth book. I scribble down whatever I can think of about Romance, Dickens &c. must hastily [?] gorge on Jane Austen tonight & dish up something tomorrow. All this criticism however may well be dislodged by the desire to write a story. The Moths hovers some where at the back of my brain. Janie & Julian have just gone. Julian a little in the style of Jem, only so much saner: broad browed, wavy haired, vast, fat, powerful, good-tempered. He still laughs a great deal; but perhaps less than he did. Perhaps he is sticking his pitchfork in the ground. Janie is a little lapdog girl; like those pug faced prominent eyed wrinkled nosed little dogs that women carry about the streets; intelligent, vivacious, opening her mouth wide & snapping it shut; on one side a carpenters granddaughter—on the other a Strachey. Perhaps a little common do I mean? But Clive yesterday at Charleston said that there were no class distinctions. We had tea from bright blue cups under the pink light of the giant hollyhock. We were all a little drugged with the country: a little bucolic I thought. It was lovely enough—made me envious of its country peace: the trees all standing securely—why did my eye catch the trees? The look of things has a great power over me. Even now, I have to watch the rooks heating up against the wind, which is high. & still I say to myself instinctively “Whats the phrase for that?” & try to make more & more vivid the roughness of the air current & the tremor of the rooks wing (deep breasting it) slicing—as if the air were full of ridges & ripples & roughnesses; they rise & sink, up & down, as if the exercise (pleased them) rubbed & braced them like swimmers in rough water. But what a little I can get down with my pen of what is so vivid to my eyes, & not only to my eyes: also to some nervous fibre or fan like membrane in my spine.

Janie Julian Leonard & I sat in the orchard till the wind got too strong, & I made them come out on the marsh & was sorry the river was low, or they might have praised it. And (irrelevantly) Miss Ritchie praises Orlando, & I was pleased till I thought, perhaps this is gratitude for our £20. Yet I dont think much either way about Orlando. Odd, how I feel myself under orders; always marching on a definite stage with each book, tho’ it is one I set myself. And Duncan at Charleston was a little too aloof & supercilious seeming."
1928.08.14,"Just back from Long Barn & Dottie’s new house, Penn in the Rocks. Can one really be in love with a house? Is there not something sterile, so that one’s mind becomes stringy in these passions? She is too anxious for other people to praise it. And I don’t want possessions. I think this is true. I dont want to be Dottie collecting endless settees & arm chairs round myself. But then I have now a pressing sense of the flight of time; & if one is so soon to arrive, why pack all these things? More truthfully, if one is so soon to start, why prepare all these impedimenta. I feel on the verge of the world, about to take flight. Dottie on the other hand feels “I have at least, in spite of every other grudge on the part of fate, 10 or 15 thousand a year; & it is only fair that I should get from my money what I can.” Somehow angrily then she sets to work to make her money slave for her. She has bought for ever & ever all these couchant rocks; rocks like kneeling elephants; agonised writhing rocks elongated rocks, rocks with grotesque roots grown into them, & Japanese trees on top. She runs about, defiant strident a little discordant in her top hoots with her dogs & says “I’m so tired—so worn out”, gesticulates, exaggerates. I like the aristocratic tradition of space & a few good things. The house itself is now in sections. Half a ceiling (overhangs) intersects what were & will be dining room & bedroom above. This gives the house a provisional air; it is not a house that has been there 300 years, & housed Penn & other families; it is nothing—which in a house is distressing.

After that country, though, how I adore the emptiness, bareness, air & colour of this! Really. I would not give this view for Dottie’s rocks. A relic I think of my fathers feeling for the Alps—this ecstasy of mine over the bare slope of Asheham hill. But then, as I remind myself, half the beauty of a country or a house comes from knowing it. One remembers old lovelinesses: knows that it is now looking ugly; waits to see it light up; knows where to find its beauty; how to ignore the bad things. This one can’t do the first time of seeing. But they build with beautiful blocks of grey stone in Kent. D.’s farmhouse was the very house for me, solid, high, with the shape of the stone showing in the wall. This is all thrown in with her rocks. And she ecstasi⁠[s]⁠es over them, fancying them sympathetic to her genius, & makes them into part of her belief in her own genius.

Monks House looked very nice, unexpectedly so, & the great lily in the window has now four flowers. They opened in the night. So I was appeased aesthetically for my disappointment in having no letters—not one. I was going to remark however that Dottie’s rocks are powdered pale greys & bright greens; they are grey as elephant backs. There are, too, bunches of scarlet berries hanging against them: only all too verdant, mossy, steamy, & enclosed for my taste. However, in the train it struck me that it is, even from one’s own point of view, a great advantage that other people should like trees & so on; Why—I cant at the moment remember."
1928.08.31,"This is the last day of August, & like almost all of them of extraordinary beauty. Each day is fine enough & hot enough for sitting out; but also full of wandering clouds; & that fading & rising of the light which so enraptures me in the downs: which I am always comparing to the light beneath an alabaster bowl, &c. The corn is now stood about in rows of three for our [four or] five solid shaped yellow cakes—rich, it seems, with eggs & spice: good to eat. Sometimes I see the cattle galloping ‘like mad’ as Dostoevsky would say, in the brooks. The clouds—if I could describe them I would: one yesterday had flowing hair on it like the very fine white hair of an old man. At this moment they are white in a leaden sky; but the sun, behind the house, is making the grass green. I walked to the racecourse today & saw a weasel.

Morgan was here for the week end; timid, touchy, infinitely charming. One night we got drunk, & talked of sodomy, & sapphism, with emotion—so much so that next day he said he had been drunk. This was started by Radclyffe Hall & her meritorious dull book. They wrote articles for Hubert all day, & got up petitions; & then Morgan saw her & she screamed like a herring gull, mad with egotism & vanity. Unless they say her book is good, she wont let them complain of the laws. Morgan said that Dr Head can convert the sodomites. “Would you like to be converted?” Leonard asked. “No” said Morgan, quite definitely. He said he thought Sapphism disgusting: partly from convention, partly because he disliked that women should be independent of men.

Probably the reason why I shall be so much bored this week end by Mrs Woolf is that we shall not be able to say a word we mean. It is like talking to a child; a child, too, with ‘feelings’: a child with “rights” & a sense of propriety & respectability & what ought to be said & done. Having made up all these principles she is, & they all are, secretly dissatisfied; because they, naturally, get no pleasure from life; are cased in thick wool from any direct contact; & so these people—an immense class—are always uneasy unless they are eating, being flattered, or doing some natural task, like nursing a child. And then, if the child is Leonard, he grows up & is horribly bored by you.

I must now begin Peacock, without attempting to describe the extraordinary primeval appearance of the farm wagons; so laden with the hay in the brooks that they look like some vast shaggy animal moving on very short legs.

We have seen Mr James about the field; & will soon, I hope, sign the agreement, or cheque; & put up a fence, which is my first act as a landowner to keep the cottage children out. Nessa, being a mother, & thus not sentimental about children, says “They can easily play somewhere else.”"
1928.09.03,"The battle of Dunbar, the Battle of Worcester, & the death of Cromwell—how often it seems to me I said that to my father (“my” father, not ‘father’ any more) at St Ives; standing bolt upright in the dining room at Talland House. And it is a perfect 3rd of September day. Leonard gave me the blue glass jug today, because he was cross when I slapped his nose with sweet peas, & because I was nice to his mother; & when I went into luncheon I saw it on the table. Indeed, I almost cried. He went to Brighton to get it for me. “I thought of it just as I was getting into the car” he said. Perhaps I have analysed his motives wrongly.

Seldom have I felt as tired as I did last night. This shaky ramshackle old lady of 76 wore us out. Her talk—I have written it for Nessa so cannot repeat—never stops; never follows a line; is always about people; starts anywhere; at any moment; breaks into a Schubert trio: did you know Len that Mr Harris lives in Gordon Sqre? So on to his daughters; how she met one playing bridge &c. What makes it difficult is that she divines states of feeling to some extent, & would say pointedly “You must often think of your writing when you are not writing, Virginia”, when through exhaustion I became silent. I had one moment of peculiar & acute discomfort this morning, when she became ‘intimate’, & said how much she had been touched when I sat beside her in the car yesterday. Why did I hate it so? I felt the horror of family life, & the terrible threat to one’s liberty that I used to feel with father, Aunt Mary or George. It is an emotion one never gets from any other human relationship. She had the right to exact this on my part; & would feel pleasure & pain irrationally, & somehow put her claws in me. These feelings are as violent as any. And there was the sentimental, yet very vain & almost insanely selfish discourse about her love for her children; how they—these dull plain serviceable Jews & Jewesses—were all splendid men & women; at which my gorge rose. How strangely she made everything commonplace, ugly, suburban, notwithstanding a charm too: something fresh & vital such as old women have, & not, I think, old men. But to be attached to her as daughter would be so cruel a fate that I can think of nothing worse; & thousands of women might be dying of it in England today: this tyranny of mother over daughter, or father; their right to the due being as powerful as anything in the world. And then, they ask, why women dont write poetry. Short of killing Mrs W. nothing could be done. Day after day one’s life would be crumpled up like a bill for 10 pen⁠[ce] 3 farthings. Nothing has ever been said of this."
1928.09.10,"This is written, as ‘this’ is so often written, to fill up a little jagged piece of time, with Kennedy, the soft duckling boy, with a bill that opens wide & says ‘Quack’ in the drawing room, & Leonard talking to Mr James about the field. Desmond, who lunched here with Julian has just gone. We spent the afternoon—hour after hour wasting away again, or why not say for once turning to gold & silver—for I should only have been reading Moby Dick otherwise—coining gold & silver talk then—talk very intimate now, more so than ever: a continuation of our talk in Tavistock Sqre the other day: there he said he had now 12 years to live; nine to be exact: & here we talked of his work, money, women, children, & writing; till I took him along the Roman road; & back to tea. I was amused to find that when Rebecca West says “men are snobs” she gets an instant rise out of Desmond; so I retorted on him with the condescending phrase used about women novelists ‘limitations in Life & Letters. But there was no acrimony in this. We talked with fertility; never working a seam dry. Do you suppose then that we are now coming like the homing rooks back to the tops of our trees? & that all this cawing is the beginning of settling in for the night? I seem to notice in several of my friends some endearing & affecting cordiality: & a pleasure in intimacy; as if the sun were sinking. Often that image comes to me with some sense of my physical state being colder now, the sun just off one; the old disc of one’s being growing cooler—but it is only just beginning: & one will turn cold & silver like the moon.

This has been a very animated summer: a summer lived almost too much in public. Often down here I have entered into a sanctuary; a nunnery; had a religious retreat; of great agony once; & always some terror: so afraid one is of loneliness: of seeing to the bottom of the vessel. That is one of the experiences I have had here in some Augusts; & got then to a consciousness of what I call ‘reality’: a thing I see before me; something abstract; but residing in the downs or sky; beside which nothing matters; in which I shall rest & continue to exist. Reality I call it. And I fancy sometimes this is the most necessary thing to me: that which I seek. But who knows—once one takes a pen & writes? How difficult not to go making ‘reality’ this & that, whereas it is one thing. Now perhaps this is my gift; this perhaps is what distinguishes me from other people; I think it may be rare to have so acute a sense of something like that—but again, who knows? I would like to express it too.

Pinker had 4 puppies the day (Friday) we went to the Bagenals & Dotty. Dotty was rust red, shabby, intense a little; she showed us the rocks. Leonard ‘took against’ her, as nurses say; violently. We drove home very fast. I on the other hand took in favour of Barbara—& wished I had gone up alone with her on to the downs. I—perhaps Leonard interrupted here."
1928.09.17,"I have precisely 5 minutes before dinner. Quentin has swallowed those precious two hours in which I was to have read Dorothy Osborne: Quentin grown elegant & self conscious, liking to use French words; very sophisticated, showing in every movement now the shadow of our faults, as a set; uneasy, I doubt not; quick, sensitive; but wanting something of Julian’s force & simplicity. So they change parts, growing, changing, turning from fat to thin. The drawing room smells with his paints—the gramophone like Moby Dick is white. Rachel came in with Angelica. She has quicksilver eyes, mended stockings, all the charm & dexterity of a poor clever man’s child, whose wits are kept brushed, who mends her stockings, who lives on her adventures.

Desmond was here, talking the other day: intimate again, & yet too urbane, perhaps; or do I think this from the letter that so annoyed me—speaking of my paper’s “butterfly lightness”—how angry I was, how depressed I became. Leonard agrees that he has a complex, which leads him to belittle & fondle thus."
1928.09.22,"This is written on the verge of my alarming holiday in Burgundy. I am alarmed of 7 days alone with Vita: interested; excited, but afraid—she may find me out, I her out. I may (& theres Mabel the Bride in her white dress at the pump. The bridegroom, a carter out of work, wears white socks. Are they pure? I doubt it. They are going to spend their honeymoon near Pevensey. He was 15 minutes late & we saw her come in wearing a wreath. And I felt this is the heart of England—this wedding in the country: history I felt; Cromwell; The Osbornes; Dorothy’s shepherdesses singing, of all of whom Mr & Mrs Jarrad seem more the descendants than I am. as if they represented the unconscious breathing of England & L. & I, leaning over the wall, were detached, unconnected. I suppose our thinking is the cause of this. We dont belong to any ‘class’; we thinkers: might as well be French or German. Yet I am English in some way—)

But I was saying I should on the whole be confident about this French journey—that it will turn out well. I’m afraid of the morning most; & 3 o’clock in the afternoon; & wanting something Vita does not want. And I shall spend the money that might have bought a table or a glass. What one buys in foreign travel is a series of scenes; which gradually diminish to one or two, such as I still have of Greece & Venice as I saw them when I was 24 or 5. And I shall love the freedom from hours; & looking about; & the thought of coming back; & sitting talking, & some things I shall read; & one or two views, &—

This has been the finest, & not only finest, but loveliest, summer in the world. Still, though it blows, how clear & bright it is; & the clouds are opalescent; the long barns on my horizon mouse coloured; the stacks pale gold. Owning the field has given a different orient to my feelings about Rodmell. I begin to dig myself in & take part in it. And I shall build another storey to the house if I make money. But the news of Orlando is black. We may sell a third that we sold of The Lighthouse before publication—Not a shop will buy save in 6es & 12es. They say this is inevitable. No one wants biography. But it is a novel, says Miss Ritchie. But it is called a biography on the title page, they say. It will have to go to the Biography shelf. I doubt therefore that we shall do more than cover expenses—a high price to pay for the fun of calling it a biography. And I was so sure it was going to be the one popular book! Also it should be 10/6 or 12/6 not 9/- Lord, lord! Thus I must write some articles this winter, if we are to have nest eggs at the Bank. Down here I have flung myself tooth & mil on my fiction book, & should have finished the first draft but for Dorothy Osborne whom I’m dashing off. It will need entire re-writing but the grind is done—the rushing through book after book & now what shall I read? These novels have hung about me so long. Mercy it is to be quit of them; & shall I read English poetry, French memoirs—shall I read now for a book to be called “The Lives of the Obscure”? And when, I wonder, shall I begin the Moths? Not until I am pressed into it by those insects themselves. Nor have I any notion what it is to be like—a completely new attempt I think. So I always think.

A very gay active summer. Dined with the Keynes’ to meet Lord Gage last Wednesday—found him with his flat face & Circassian blood, more of a character than I expected. Clive with inverse snobbery had run him down. We talked about the King, & he snubbed me by saying that he remarked an odd fact—everyone talks to him about the King. Every class, every kind of person, is interested to know what the King has for dinner. And here was I, the intellectual, the labour woman, doing just the same thing. And there were the Russell Cookes; her I liked; him I hated. A woman is in some ways so much better than a man—more natural, juicy, unfettered. But then he is a bounder, a climber, a shoving young man, who wants to be smart, cultivated, go-ahead & all the rest of it. I must use that cliché because I must do my Osborne article. & it is getting cold out here."
1928.10.27,"A scandal, a scandal, to let so much time slip, & I leaning on the Bridge watching it go. Only leaning has not been my pose: running up & down, irritably, excitedly restlessly. And the stream viciously eddying. Why do I write these metaphors? Because I have written nothing for an age.

Orlando has been published. I went to Burgundy with Vita. We did not find each other out. It flashed by. Yet I was glad to see Leonard again. How disconnected this is! My ambition is from this very moment, 8 minutes to six, on Saturday evening, to attain complete concentration again. When I have written here, I am going to open Fanny Burney’s diaries, & work solidly at that article which poor Miss McKay cables about. I am going to read; to think. I gave up reading & thinking on the 24th of Sept when I went to France. I came back, & we plunged into London & publishing. I am a little sick of Orlando. I think I am a little indifferent now what anyone thinks. Joy’s life’s in the doing—I murder, as usual, a quotation: I mean its the writing, not the being read that excites me. And as I can’t write while I’m being read, I am always a little hollow hearted; whipped up; but not so happy as in solitude. The reception, as they say, surpassed expectations. Sales beyond our record for the first week. I was floating rather lazily on praise, when Squire barked in the Observer, but even as I sat reading him on the backs last Sunday in the showering red leaves & their illumination, I felt the rock of self esteem untouched in me. “This doesn’t really hurt” I said to myself; even now; & sure enough, before evening I was calm, untouched. And now theres Hugh [Walpole] in the Morning Post to spread the butter again, & Rebecca West—such a trumpet call of praise—thats her way—that I feel a little sheepish & silly. And now no more of that I hope.

Thank God, my long toil at the women’s lecture is this moment ended. I am back from speaking at Girton, in floods of rain. Starved but valiant young women—that’s my impression. Intelligent eager, poor; & destined to become schoolmistresses in shoals. I blandly told them to drink wine & have a room of their own. Why should all the splendour, all the luxury of life be lavished on the Julians & the Francises, & none on the Phares & the Thomases? There’s Julian not much relishing it, perhaps. I fancy sometimes the world changes. I think I see reason spreading. But I should have liked a closer & thicker knowledge of life. I should have liked to deal with real things sometimes. I get such a sense of tingling & vitality from an evenings talk like that; one’s angularities & obscurities are smoothed & lit. How little one counts, I think: how little anyone counts; how fast & furious & masterly life is; & how all these thousands are swimming for dear life. I felt elderly & mature. And nobody respected me. They were very eager, egotistical, or rather not much impressed by age & repute. Very little reverence or that sort of thing about. The corridors of Girton are like vaults in some horrid high church cathedral—on & on they go, cold & shiny—with a light burning. High gothic rooms; acres of bright brown wood; here & there a photograph.

And we saw Trinity & King’s this morning. Now to concentrate on English literature—forgetting Mary & Tom & how we went to be read aloud to, & Lady Cunard, & Clive back & Nessa back, & the Well of Loneliness. But Thank God to get back to writing again."
1928.11.07,"And this shall be written for my own pleasure,—

But that phrase inhibits me: for if one writes only for one’s own pleasure,—I dont know what it is that happens. I suppose the convention of writing is destroyed; therefore one does not write at all. I am rather headachy, & dimly obscured with sleeping draught. This is the aftermath (what does that mean?—Trench, whom I open idly apparently says nothing) of Orlando. Yes, yes, since I wrote here I have become two inches & a half higher in the public view. I think I may say that I am now among the well known writers. I had tea with Lady Cunard—might have lunched or dined any day. I found her in a little cap telephoning. It was not her atmosphere—this of solitary talk. She is too shrewd to expand, & needs society to make her rash & random which is her point. Ridiculous little parrokeet faced woman; but not quite sufficiently ridiculous. I kept wishing for superlatives: could not get the illusion to flap its wings. Flunkeys, yes; but a little drab & friendly. Marble floors, yes; but no glamour; no tune strumming, for me at least. And the two of us sitting there had almost to be conventional & flat—reminds me of Sir Thomas Browne—the greatest book of our times—said a little flatly by a woman of business, to me who don’t believe in that kind of thing unless launched with champagne & garlands. Then in came Lord Donegall, a glib Irish youth, dark sallow slick, on the Press. Dont they treat you like a dog? I said. “No, not at all” he replied, astonished that a marquis could be treated like a dog by anyone. And then we went up & up to see pictures on stairs in ballrooms & finally to Lady C.’s bedroom, hung entirely with flower pieces. The bed has its triangular canopy of rose red silk; the windows, looking on the square, are hung with green brocade. Her poudreuse—like mine only painted & gilt stood open with gold brushes looking glasses, & there on her gold slippers were neatly laid gold stockings. All this paraphernalia for one stringy old hop o’ my thumb. She set the two great musical boxes playing & I said did she lie in bed & listen to them? But no. She has nothing fantastic in that way about her. Money is important. She told me rather sordid stories of Lady Sackville never visiting her without fobbing something off on her—now a bust, worth £5, for which she paid £100; now a brass knocker. “And then her talk I didn’t care for it…” Somehow I saw into these sordid commonplace talks, & could not sprinkle the air with gold dust easily. But no doubt she has her acuity, her sharp peck at life; only how adorable, I thought, as I tiptoed home in my tight shoes, in the fog, in the chill, could one open one of these doors that I still open so venturously, & find a live interesting real person, a Nessa, a Duncan, a Roger. Some one new, whose mind would begin vibrating. Coarse & usual & dull these Cunards & Colefaxes are—for all their astonishing competence in the commerce of life.

And I cannot think what to ‘write next’. I mean the situation is, this Orlando is of course a very quick brilliant book. Yes, but I did not try to explore. And must I always explore? Yes I think so still. Because my reaction is not the usual. Nor can I even after all these years run it off lightly. Orlando taught me how to write a direct sentence; taught me continuity & narrative, & how to keep the realities at bay. But I purposely avoided of course any other difficulty. I never got down to my depths & made shapes square up, as I did in The Lighthouse.

Well but Orlando was the outcome of a perfectly definite, indeed overmastering impulse. I want fun. I want fantasy. I want (& this was serious) to give things their caricature value. And still this mood hangs about me. I want to write a history, say of Newnham or the womans movement, in the same vein. The vein is deep in me—at least sparkling, urgent. But is it not stimulated by applause? overstimulated? My notion is that there are offices to be discharged by talent for the relief of genius: meaning that one has the play side; the gift when it is mere gift, unapplied gift; & the gift when it is serious, going to business. And one relieves the other.

Yes, but The Moths? That was to be an abstract mystical eyeless book: a playpoem. And there may be affectation in being too mystical, too abstract; saying Nessa & Roger & Duncan & Ethel Sands admire that: it is the uncompromising side of me; therefore I had better win their approval—

Again, one reviewer says that I have come to a crisis in the matter of style: it is now so fluent & fluid that it runs through the mind like water.

That disease began in The Lighthouse. The first part came fluid—how I wrote & wrote!

Shall I now check & consolidate, more in the Dalloway Jacob’s Room style?

I rather think the upshot will be books that relieve other books: a variety of styles & subjects: for after all, that is my temperament, I think: to be very little persuaded of the truth of anything—what I say, what people say—always to follow, blindly instinctively with a sense of leaping over a precipice—the call of—the call of—now, if I write The Moths I must come to terms with these mystical feelings.

Desmond destroyed our Saturday walk; he is now mouldy & to me depressing. He is perfectly reasonable & charming. Nothing surprises, nothing shocks him. He has been through it all one feels. He has come out rolled, smoothed, rather sodden rather creased & jumbled, like a man who has sat up all night in a third class railway carriage. His fingers are stained yellow with cigarettes. One tooth in the lower jaw is missing. His hair is dank. His eye more than ever dubious. He has a hole in his blue sock. Yet he is resolute & determined—thats what I find so depressing. He seems to be sure that it is his view that is the right one; ours vagaries, deviations. And if his view is the right one, God knows there is nothing to live for: not a greasy biscuit. And the egotism of men surprises & shocks me even now. Is there a woman of my acquaintance who could sit in my arm chair from 3 to 6.30 without the semblance of a suspicion that I may be busy, or tired, or bored; & so sitting could talk, grumbling & grudging, of her difficulties, worries; then eat chocolates, then read a book, & go at last, apparently self-complacent & wrapped in a kind of blubber of misty self satisfaction? Not the girls at Newnham or Girton. They are far too spry; far too disciplined. None of that self-confidence is their lot.

We paid for our dinner at the Lion. Miss Thomas & Miss ——? were relieved, not to have to part with quite so many half crowns. And they showed us the chocolate coloured corridors of Girton, like convent cells;—

And there was the meeting in Mr Williams Ellises studio—a vast hall in Ebury street, with ostentatiously ragged chair covers. Our raggedness, as a profession, was not ostentatious alas; it is part of our souls; a dowdiness that is not ragged, however; a meticulous respectability which is not my working state; for then I am, I think, almost picturesque. As a crowd together we achieve only dinginess & something egotistic & unreserved in our faces; as for old Garnett, I felt surely someone ought to put that surly shaggy unkempt old monstrosity (certainly his nails want cutting & his coat is matted with mud & burrs) in the lethal chamber. D⁠[itt]⁠o of his mistress: the top half Esquimaux, the bottom Maytime in Hampstead—sprigged muslin, sandals. Vita as usual like a lamp or torch in all this petty bourgeoisdom; a tribute to the breeding of the Sackvilles, for without care of her clothes she appears among them (in all the sanity & strength of a well made body) like a lampost, straight, glowing. None of us have that; or know not how to carry it.

Poor Rose Macaulay—a mere chit; a wafer—& so on to the Hendersons in Hampstead, where my spleen & Frankie’s were twin spleens: poor Frankie however kept his rattle & clapper going, hour after hour, sounding alone, while I sank in a tolerable arm chair & could say nothing; though Mrs Enfield who has read the whole of Balzac made advances with Proust. Faith, I think, saw in this languor, bad manners & conceit. She saw us despising her home & husband. She despised them herself. And she went to bed saying something bitter to Hubert, & looked back into the drawing room, wondering why all the colours were wrong. But then next morning there are the children at breakfast & she recovers somewhat but has to speak severely about Mrs Maypole, the hired help (10/- a night) who dropped the plates, & left Mr Birrell holding the ladle; & the ice was salt. Then she takes up Orlando & says, to Hubert, “This is a greatly over rated book—It is far far worse than The Lighthouse…’ at the same time, ‘What exciting lives these people lead! Bloomsbury…”"
1928.11.08,"Just to solace myself before correcting Hardy & Gissing, I will note that we went to Karin’s party last night. The truth is the stimulus is too brisk; one rattles; & only a shout can be heard, & one must stand; & one gets caught, like a bramble on a river by some branch; & hooked up out of the eddy. An emerald green Russian talked to me of seals & then gave me a card; I am to lecture 4 times a week for 8 weeks in America—Oh yes—& she will arrange most advantageous terms. But won’t mention money in a drawing room: so we lapse upon seals again, or Ann [Stephen]’s rabbit—a chinchilla animal lying languidly extended in the midst of the rumpus, exquisite, alien. Ethel Sands, fanning my vanity into a glow: yet she was downright the other night that Orlando isn’t a patch on Lighthouse, with talk of luncheon parties where nothing is talked about but &c. &c.

Janet & Angus to dinner. The young man who wants a job is not amiable; poor old Angus cuts up a little rough, & launches into anxious worried explanations about his play. He will never now break through that chrysalis core of gentlemanly reserve, caution, good manners which shells him in. I think he will meditate more & more upon the glories of being a Davidson. Yet he has his scallywag side, the poor man, dancing & dining, which is to his credit. Janet in comparison seemed rapid, decided & lustrous, all in gold for Karin’s party with Madge’s gold necklace, & something very like Madge now & then; but tempered with the Vaughan decision. She is an attractive woman; competent; disinterested, taking blood tests all day to solve some abstract problem.

… think it"
1928.11.10,"This unexampled fluency here is due to the fact that I should be reading Miss Jewsbury, answering letters (Lady Cunard to dine alone with George Moore) or correcting Hardy & Gissing. All these tasks are unworthy the sacred morning hours. Phrase tossing can only be done then; so I toss them privately here, feeling relieved not to be making money, once in a while. Shall I say that Bennett in the Ev⁠[ening] Standard hurt me less than Squire in the Observer? Not at all, I think;—an odd thing, though, how I am praised & abused: & what a sting I am in the flanks of Squires & Bennetts.

What is more interesting—& Lord knows this is true—I am speaking coolly & faithfully—is the trial yesterday at Bow Street. We were all packed in by 10.30: the door at the top of the court opened; in stepped the debonair distinguished magistrate; we all rose; he bowed; took his seat under the lion & the unicorn, & then proceeded. Something like a Harley St. specialist investigating a case. All black & white, tie pin, clean shaven, wax coloured, & carved, in that light, like ivory. He was ironical at first: raised his eyebrows & shrugged. Later I was impressed by the reason of the law, its astuteness, its formality. Here have we evolved a very remarkable fence between us & barbarity; something commonly recognised; half humbug & ceremony therefore—when they pulled out calf bound books & read old phrases I thought this; & the bowing & scraping made me think it; but in these banks runs a live stream. What is obscenity? What is literature? What is the difference between the subject & the treatment? In what cases is evidence allowable? This last, to my relief, was decided against us: we could not be called as experts in obscenity, only in art. So Desmond who had got under the palanquin where he looked too indifferent, too calm, too completely at his ease to be natural, was only asked his qualifications & then, not allowed to answer the obscene question, was dismissed. In the hall I talked to Lady Troubridge (who used to sculpt & last time we met was a tea party, as children, in Montpelier Sqre) & John—John lemon yellow, tough, stringy, exacerbated. Their costs run into 4 figures she said. And Leonard thinks this heralds a subscription. After lunch we heard an hour more, & then the magistrate, increasingly deliberate & courteous, said he would read the book again & give judgment next Friday at two, [on] the pale tepid vapid book which lay damp & slab all about the court. And I lost my little Roman brooch, & that is the end of this great day, so far. A curious brown top lighted scene; very stuffy; policemen at the doors; matrons passing through. An atmosphere quite decent & formal, of adult people."
1928.11.25,"Leonard’s 48th birthday. We were at Rodmell, where all has fallen into our hands, rapidly, unexpectedly: on top of the field we get a cottage, & Percy [Bartholomew] is ‘our man’. Mrs Percy has inherited from that strange relationship of hers—I suspect her of being the illegitimate child of a circus manager—they travelled—she never speaks of her family—her father died alone—her Auntie left jewels & clothes—she has inherited £330 & some odd shillings. She has bought a set of big white teeth; & now thinks of a gramophone or a wireless set.

I took Essex & Eth (Lytton’s) down to read, & Lord forgive me!—find it a poor book. I have not finished it; & am keeping it to see if my [text ends]"
1928.11.28,"Father’s birthday. He would have been 1928

1832

96 96, yes, today; & could have been 96, like other people one has known; but mercifully was not. His life would have entirely ended mine. What would have happened? No writing, no books;—inconceivable. I used to think of him & mother daily; but writing The Lighthouse, laid them in my mind. And now he comes back sometimes, but differently. (I believe this to be true—that I was obsessed by them both, unhealthily; & writing of them was a necessary act.) He comes back now more as a contemporary. I must read him some day. I wonder if I can feel again, I hear his voice, I know this by heart?

Last night was one of our evenings—apparently successful; Adrian, Hope, Christa, Clive, Raymond, Bunny, Lytton, Vita & Valery towards the end: & Elizabeth Ponsonby. People enjoyed it. Perhaps I didnt; perhaps I did. Half way through Lytton vanished (he lodges upstairs) brayed out of the room by Clive’s vociferation, L. thinks. Clive makes it all very strident, gaslit, band played. I marked a queer change in my feeling when Lytton went. At other times I have felt his silence disapproving; have moderated my folly under it, & tried to keep him from going. But now that man writes Elizabeth & Essex; I kept thinking: well, if he can palm that off on us after years of effort—that lively superficial meretricious book—he can go or stay as he likes. I feel no bite in his disapproval. And though one of my vile vices is jealousy, of other writers’ fame, though I am (& I think we all are) secretly pleased to find Lytton’s book a bad one, I also feel depressed. If I were to analyse, the truth is I think that the pleasure is mean, & therefore not deep or satisfying; one would, in the depths, have got real pleasure, though superficial pain, had E & E been a masterpiece. Oh yes, I should—for I have a mind that feeds perfectly dispassionately & apart from my vanities & jealousies upon literature; & that would have taken a masterpiece to itself. Mixed last night with my feeling was some curious personal dissatisfaction: that Lytton whom I loved & love should write like that. It is a reflection on my own taste. It is so feeble, so shallow; & yet Lytton in himself is neither. So one next accuses the public; & then the Carringtons & the young men. And one furbishes up a cloistered secluded invalidish Lytton whipping the flanks of the language & putting it to this foaming gallop, when the poor beast is all spavins & sores. And Dadie & Pernel & Janie Bussy & Dorothy [Bussy] all declared with emotion that this book was his best!

So the days pass, & I ask myself sometimes whether one is not hypnotised, as a child by a silver globe, by life; & whether this is living. Its very quick, bright, exciting. But superficial perhaps. I should like to take the globe in my hands & feel it quietly, round, smooth, heavy. & so hold it, day after day. I will read Proust I think. I will go backwards & forwards.

As for my next book, I am going to hold myself from writing till I have it impending in me: grown heavy in my mind like a ripe pear; pendant, gravid, asking to be cut or it will fall. The Moths still haunts me, coming, as they always do, unbidden, between tea & dinner, while L. plays the gramophone. I shape a page or two; & make myself stop. Indeed I am up against some difficulties. Fame to begin with. Orlando has done very well. Now I could go on writing like that—the tug & suck are at me to do it. People say this was so spontaneous, so natural. And I would like to keep those qualities if I could without losing the others. But those qualities were largely the result of ignoring the others. They came of writing exteriorly; & if I dig, must I not lose them? And what is my own position towards the inner & the outer? I think a kind of ease & dash are good;—yes: I think even externality is good; some combination of them ought to be possible. The idea has come to me that what I want now to do is to saturate every atom. I mean to eliminate all waste, deadness, superfluity: to give the moment whole; whatever it includes. Say that the moment is a combination of thought; sensation; the voice of the sea. Waste, deadness, come from the inclusion of things that dont belong to the moment; this appalling narrative business of the realist: getting on from lunch to dinner: it is false, unreal, merely conventional. Why admit any thing to literature that is not poetry—by which I mean saturated? Is that not my grudge against novel⁠[ist]⁠s—that they select nothing? The poets succeeding by simplifying: practically everything is left out. I want to put practically everything in; yet to saturate. That is what I want to do in The Moths. It must include nonsense, fact, sordidity: but made transparent. I think I must read Ibsen & Shakespeare & Racine. And I will write something about them; for that is the best spur, my mind being what it is; then I read with fury & exactness; otherwise I slip & skip: I am a lazy reader. But no: I am surprised & a little disquieted by the remorseless severity of my mind: that it never stops reading & writing; makes me write on Geraldine Jewsbury, on Hardy, on Women—is too professional, too little any longer a dreamy amateur."
1928.12.08,"Here is a note barely dashed off (10 to one—just finished, very provisionally “Phases of Fiction”) after Christabel MacClaren; & her ‘winkle’ party, as I call it, the other night. I mean she picked me out with a pin—about Lesbianism, & Dotty—(she is not one). My note was about her attitude to men; the adoring, flattering woman’s attitude, which I so seldom see so purely. Like a flame leaping up. Clive “the most honourable of men”—yes but said with a devoutness, a radiancy, that made me laugh. Is this the ‘natural’ attitude between the sexes? What Clive has, the other way round for women? So cordial, so appreciative; I could hear it kindling her voice when she said “The men were bathing or writing letters or talking that was at Sherfield. The men, good delightful creatures, were so engaged while that wretched furtive creature D. pursued me. And I can see man after man, Desmond, Clive &c, Wells, Shaw, warming his hands at this natural warmth, & expanding. It amused me. The other thought I had was about the limits of luxury: how far can the human soul stretch into rugs & rooms; at what point they suffocate its force. I have seen several rich people this autumn; & thought them, perhaps, dulled, coarsened by it: Lady Cunard; two days ago Mrs Bowen & Mrs Grenfell at Lydia’s."
1928.12.09,"These reflections are written on a bitter cold evening to get the taste of a sentence into my mouth again. Angelica came this morning, & every time I lifted my pen she,—heavenly little creature that she is, demure, witty fantastic, neatly tipped the cup upside down; like a fool I went on trying to write, & only gave up when I was in a state of exasperation, not with her, but with my book: I was beginning a new beginning to Fiction. Now it is after tea; Angus will be coming to see Leonard about a character; & I am escaped, & can’t be got at; & shall read Troilus & Cressida (Chaucer) till dinner. I have again seen too many people, without much intensity. Lydia’s foolish tea party; & the Bagenals’ lunch, & Christa; & then Long Bam, & being driven up by Dotty; “I cant say I understand Harold—I can’t really say I do”—Then Vita, making a sacrifice of her quiet evening, drove up to London & heard her broadcast & went back with her, to save me the solitary drive. This worried me, rather: for whom would I give up this evening? & then Dotty with her pecking exacting ways “Please dear put the window up—put the window down” makes Vita seem to me pathetically gentle & kind. But none of this matters very much I agree, & Lord helping, I shall work all this week—save for the evenings. It is so cold my back is cold now, while the fire roasts my feet; fire is striking & many fire engines have rushed down Southampton Row. The King is dragging along, & the shop assistants are in fear lest they shall lose their Christmas bonus. Christmas impends. And we shall spend it alone here, I think, & go to Rodmell afterwards & plan a new room, with Kennedy. And then to Berlin we say. Meanwhile Nessa & I give our Tuesday evenings, & too many people press to come.

But why I ask “see” people? Whats the point? These isolated occasions which come so often. May I come & see you? And what they get, or I get, save the sense of a slide passing on a screen, I cant say."
1928.12.18,"Here I should be pegging away at Fiction; rather an interesting little book I think; but I cannot get my mind down on to it, like a bird of prey firmly attached. I was switched off to write a eulogy of Lady Strachey, burnt yesterday with a bunch of our red & white carnations on top of her. It is odd how little her death means to me—for this reason. About a year ago she was said to be dying; & at once (Adrian told me) I made up my usual visualisation; felt the whole emotion of Lady Strachey’s passing—her memories & so on—that night; & then she did not die; & now when she does die, not a vision, not an emotion comes my way. These little tricks of psychology amuse me.

L. has just been in to consult about a 3rd edition of Orlando. This has been ordered; we have sold over 6000 copies; & sales are still amazingly brisk—150 today for instance; most days between 50 & 60; always to my surprise. Will they stop or go on? Anyhow my room is secure. For the first time since I married 1912—1928—16 years—I have been spending money. The spending muscle does not work naturally yet. I feel guilty; put off buying, when I know that I should buy; & yet have an agreeable luxurious sense of coins in my pocket beyond my weekly 13/- which was always running out, or being encroached upon. Yesterday I spent 15/- on a steel brooch. I spent £3 on a mother of pearl necklace—& I haven’t bought a jewel for 20 years perhaps! I have carpeted the dining room—& so on. I think one’s soul is the better for this lubrication; & I am going to spend freely, & then write, & so keep my brain on the boil. All this money making originated in a spasm of black despair one night at Rodmell 2 years ago. I was tossing up & down on those awful waves: when I said that I could find a way out. (For part of my misery was the perpetual limitation of everything; no chairs, or beds, no comfort, no beauty; & no freedom to move: all of which I determined there & then to win). And so came, with some argument, even tears one night (& how seldom I have ever cried!) to an agreement with Leonard about sharing money after a certain sum; & then opened a bank account; & now, at the lowest shall have £200 to put there on Jan. 1st. The important thing is to spend freely, without fuss or anxiety; & to trust to one’s power of making more—Indeed, I cannot at this moment very seriously doubt that I shall earn more, this next 5 years, than ever before.

But to return to Max Beerbohm. I met him at Ethel’s the other night. As I came in a thick set old man (such was my impression) rose, & I was introduced. No freakishness, no fancy about him. His face is solidified; has a thick moustache; a red veined skin, heavy lines; but then his eyes are perfectly round, very large, & sky blue. His eyes become dreamy & merry when the rest of him is well groomed & decorous in the extreme. He is brushed, neat, urbane. Halfway through dinner he turned to me & we began a ‘nice’, interesting, flattering, charming kind of talk; he told me how he had read an article on Addison at Bognor during the war; when literature seemed extinct; & there was his own name. I daresay V.W. catches your eye as M.B. does mine. And nothing has encouraged me more. So I said, as I think, that he is immortal. In a small way, he said; but with complacency. Like a jewel which is hard & flawless, yet always changing. A charming image he said, very kind, approving, & what half flattered half saddened me, equal. Am I on that level? Virginia Woolf says—V.W. thinks—how do you write? & so on: I was one of his colleagues & fellows in the art of writing; but not I hoped quite so old. Anyhow he asked me how I wrote. For he hacks every step with his pen, & therefore never alters. He thought I wrote like this. I told him I had to cut out great chunks. I wish you would send them to me, he said; simply; Indeed, he was nothing if not kind; but looked long & steadily. Looked at Lord David [Cecil]—that queer painters look, so matching, so considering apart from human intent; yet with him not entirely. After dinner, he leant on the mantelpiece & Maurice Baring & I flittered round him like a pair of butterflies, praising, laughing, extravagant. And he said he was so pleased by the praise of intelligent people like ourselves. But always he had to be led off to talk politely to this person & that; finally disappeared, very dignified, very discreet in his white waistcoat, pressing my hand in his plump firm one long; & saying what a pleasure &c. I own that I dont find much difference between the great & ourselves—indeed they are like us: I mean they dont have the frills & furbelows of the small; come to terms quickly & simply. But we got, of course, very little way. He talked of Hardy, & said he couldnt bear Jude the Obscure: thought it falsified life, for there is really more happiness than sorrow in life, & Hardy tries to prove the opposite. And his writing is so bad. Then I ran down—but he reads my essays & knows this—Belloc. M.B. said that Belloc, one must remember, poured out ten books a year on history poetry &c. He was one of those full unequal people who were never perfect, as he, M.B., might be called perfect in a small way. But he was glad I didnt like him. Charles Lamb had the most beautiful things in him & then he spoilt them. He had never read a book except Pendennis & Tess of the d’Urbervilles till he left Oxford. And now at last, at Rapallo, he reads. He is taking back Elizabeth & Orlando (pronounced in the French way) to read; treats he looks forward to.

Among others were present … Mrs Hammersley, Lord David, Hutchinsons, &c.

And we dined last night with the Hutchinsons & met George Moor⁠[e]—like an old silver coin now, so white so smooth; with his little flipper hands, like a walruses; & his chubby cheeks, & little knees—yet always saying the thing that comes into his head; fresh, juvenile almost for that reason; & very shrewd. Gave a description of Riceyman Steps—the ferns covered in dust, the man with cancer marrying the woman with fits—Not what one calls a distinguished mind—& what a subject to choose! It seems as if he attaches much importance to subject. He was always praising or altering ways of treating stories. He is writing some Greek novel now, dictating to a charming lady, who has every virtue, save that she is not forthcoming & therefore will not marry. He dictates, & this gives him something to bite upon: then he re-dictates. He never writes. There are no mss of his in existence. Perhaps the dictated style is a true account of his style & H⁠[enry]. J⁠[ames]’s. & accounts for their fluidity, their verbosity. And what it comes to is that the great are very simple; quick to come to terms with; reserved; & dont pay any attention to other peoples books (Moore throws scorn on them all—Shaw—a shriek of vulgarity—poisoned with vulgarity—never wrote a good sentence in his life—Wells—I spare myself Wells—& Galsworthy—) & live in an atmosphere very serene, bright, & fenced off: for all that they are more to the point than ordinary people; go to the heart of things directly. Moore toddled off & got quickly into a cab, Jack said, for all his look of an old silver coin."
1929.01.04,"How odd to think that I have given the world something that the world enjoys—I refer to the Manchester Guardian—Orlando is recognised for the masterpiece that it is. The Times does not mention Nessa’s pictures. Yet, she said last night, I have spent a long time over one of them. Then I think to myself, So I have something, instead of children, & fall comparing our lives. I note my own withdrawal from those desires; my absorption in what I call, inaccurately, ideas: this vision.

We saw Koteliansky on Christmas day. Rather dryer & yellower in the cheeks, like an orange that is old. He was in his shirt sleeves. He had been washing up his Christmas dinner, which was “No, not a very good one … Come in Come in”. This was Katherine’s room he said. It is poverty stricken, tidy, clean—a bed, a table. It looks over back gardens to the trees of Regent’s Park. We went straight into the old abuse of Murry; went back ten years, to Richmond, & those long visits; those difficult emphatic ways. He is, one says, the same. Very poor, as definite as ever. Still talking about Lawrence; a very very good writer but his last book DISGUSTING. You must read Counterpoint. Why? Because he is a seerious man, a cultivated man. And it is typical of the age. It is a painful book a horrid book but it is that. Still the same seriousness, & concentration upon say 5 objects which he has been staring at these 40 years. Still he gnaws the bone of Katherine & Murry. And all the time some emotion was working in him. He was glad we had come. What could he give us? He gave me a red wooden box, a Russian toy, & stuffed it full of his Russian cigarettes. His voice quivered now & then. He looked at me with emotion. All the linoleum was shining, where he had cleaned it, & he had painted the woodwork with two sorts of Reckitt’s blue: so that it shone very bright. He had painted it over & over. There he lives, how heaven knows. People will no longer buy his translations. His dog (a pure Jewish dog) is dead.

Now is life very solid, or very shifting? I am haunted by the two contradictions. This has gone on for ever: will last forever; goes down to the bottom of the world—this moment I stand on. Also it is transitory, flying, diaphanous. I shall pass like a cloud on the waves. Perhaps it may be that though we change; one flying after another, so quick so quick, yet we are somehow successive, & continuous—we human beings; & show the light through. But what is the light? I am impressed by the transitoriness of human life to such an extent that I am often saying a farewell—after dining with Roger for instance; or reckoning how many more times I shall see Nessa."
1929.03.28,"It is a disgrace indeed; no diary has been left so late in the year. The truth was that we went to Berlin on the 16th of January, & then I was in bed for three weeks afterwards, & then could not write; perhaps for another three, & have spent my energy since in one of my excited outbursts of composition—writing what I made up in bed, a final version of Women & Fiction.

And as usual, I am bored by narrative. I want only to say how I met Nessa in Tottenham Court Road this afternoon, both of us sunk fathoms deep in that wash of reflection in which we both swim about. She will be gone on Wednesday for 4 months. It is queer how instead of drawing apart, life draws us together. But I was thinking a thousand things as I carried my teapot, gramophone records & stockings under my arm. It is one of those days that I called ‘potent’ when we lived in Richmond.

Perhaps I ought not to go on repeating what I have always said about the spring. One ought perhaps to be forever finding new things to say, since life draws on. One ought to invent a fine narrative style. Certainly there are many new ideas always forming in my head. For one, that I am going to enter a nunnery these next months; & let myself down into my mind; Bloomsbury being done with. I am going to face certain things. It is going to be a time of adventure & attack, rather lonely & painful I think. But solitude will be good for a new book. Of course, I shall make friends. I shall be external outwardly. I shall buy some good clothes & go out into new houses. All the time I shall attack this angular shape in my mind. I think the Moths (if that is what I shall call it) will be very sharply cornered. I am not satisfied though with the frame. There is this sudden fertility which may be mere fluency. In old days books were so many sentences absolutely struck with an axe out of crystal: & now my mind is so impatient, so quick, in some ways so desperate.

Old age is withering us; Clive, Sibyl, Francis—all wrinkled & dusty; going over the hoops, along the track. Only in myself, I say, forever bubbles this impetuous torrent. So that even if I see ugliness in the glass, I think, very well, inwardly I am more full of shape & colour than ever. I think I am bolder as a writer. I am alarmed by my own cruelty with my friends. Clive, I say, is intolerably dull. Francis is a runaway milk lorry.

I feel on the verge of some strenuous adventure: yes; as if this spring day were the hatching; the portal; the opening through which I shall go upon this experience. So when I wake early, I brace myself out of my terrors by saying that I shall need great courage: after all, I say, I made £1000 all from willing it early one morning. No more poverty I said; & poverty has ceased. I am summoning Philcox next week to plan a room—I have money to build it, money to furnish it. And we have the new car, & we can drive to Edinburgh in June if we like, & go to Cassis.

The new year was threatened with a pumping machine, making this studio a trial; for it pumped every 25 minutes. Now for a fortnight it has not pumped. Am I saved? Now it is so quiet that I only hear sparrows; & a voice singing in the hotel. A perfect room for me. Nessa has taken a studio & will let 37, thus ending, for ever I suppose, her Gordon Square life. How much I admire this handling of life as if it were a thing one could throw about; this handling of circumstance. Angelica will go to school. I have now many admiring letters to answer. Simpkins said today that many great publishers would be proud to have our list. In 10 years we shall be rather celebrated. At anyrate, without any trouble to write well, as there should have been, I have once more launched this diary."
1929.04.13,"Habits gradually change the face of ones life as time changes one’s physical face; & one does not know it. Here am I using this studio to sit in, & with my diary to write down here; almost always after tea I retire here. And then I never print now or address envelopes. So perhaps habit will snuff out this diary one day.

I am sordidly debating within myself the question of Nelly; the perennial question. It is an absurdity, how much time L. & I have wasted in talking about servants. And it can never be done with because the fault lies in the system. How can an uneducated woman let herself in, alone, into our lives?—what happens is that she becomes a mongrel; & has no roots any where. I could put my theory into practice by getting a daily of a civilised kind, who had her baby in Kentish town; & treated me as an employer, not friend. Here is a fine rubbish heap left by our parents to be swept.

It is very quiet & very cold. I walked Pinka through the Saturday streets this afternoon & was woken to the fact that it is April by a primrose on the pavement. I had been thinking I was on one of my January walks, with lights lit at 3.30 in peoples bedrooms. Rodmell was impracticable because of the cold; & until I have a room, I cannot go there meaning to work.

We always do mean to work.

I have just agreed to do another 4 articles for Mrs Van Doren, because she has raised her price to £50 an article—so that, whatever the cost, I can have my new room. And all this money is changing my habits. I’m not sure it is not the memorable fact about this spring—for the 1928

1912

16 first time since 1912—16 years that is—I am able to look say at blue lustre cups in a shop & decide, well why not buy them? But they cost £6 … But then I am making over £1000 a year. I can make as much as I want. This little colloquy still takes place before I can unbend my old penurious muscles. But it is always better to buy than not to buy I think.

Hugh Walpole was here the other day, from 4.30 to 7.15 alone, over the fire. The same uneasy talk as usual; brisk & breezy, hating war; & then this morbid egotism & desire to scratch the same place over & over again—his own defects as a writer & how to remedy them, what they spring from; all mixed up with his normal, & usual sense of being prosperous & admired—from which, as he admits when I ask him, he gets great pleasure. He starts indeed to protest that he gives pleasure, does good, but can’t bring that out in my presence; which is why he seeks my presence—a scratching stone to rid him of the world’s mud. He protests too much. On the other hand, I like these bustling vigour⁠[ous] characters: I like talk of Russia, & war & great doings & famous people—If I don’t see them I romanticise them.

Leonard is upstairs finishing the Hogarth Press accounts. Yesterday he gave the three stall hands a bonus: Mrs C. £25; Belcher £20; Kennedy £20. They sent up a bunch of roses later in the day. For the first time we have made over £400 profit. And 7 people now depend on us; & I think with pride that 7 people depend, largely, upon my hand writing on a sheet of paper. That is of course a great solace & pride to me. Its not scribbling; its keeping 7 people fed & housed: a great big man like Percy; a carrot faced woman like Cartwright; they live on my words. They will be feeding off Women & Fiction next year for which I predict some sale. It has considerable conviction. I think that the form, half talk half soliloquy allows me to get more onto the page than any how else. It made itself up & forced itself upon me (in this form—the thinking had been done & the writing stiffly & unsatisfactorily 4 times before) as I lay in bed after Berlin. I used to make it up at such a rate that when I got pen & paper I was like a water bottle turned upside down. The writing was as quick as my hand could write; too quick, for I am now toiling to revise; but this way gives one freedom & lets one leap from back to back of one’s thoughts.

Happily, for my health of soul, I am now very little noticed, & so can forget the fictitious self, for it is half so, which fame makes up for one: I can see my famous self tapering about the world. I am more comfortable when shut up, self-contained as now.

The great pleasure of money is to spend a pound—as on a dinner at Richmond—without accounting for it—I dined there with Vita. It was cold. We drove round the Park. I saw a man leading a large cat on a chain. I saw many odd parties in the hotel. How can they come here tonight, I said? There was the old woman gorged like a vulture. The woman with her foot cocked under the table at this angle, all through dinner: the young spark in grey with the pink carnation; the two prominenteyed daughters in velvet; & all kinds of emotions, of ridicule & interest crossing the vast room perpetually from one table to another. The waiters, I thought, are only here this one night; everything is unreal & will vanish. But it is going on precisely the same at this moment. Have you had a tiring day Miss ——? says Mrs —— leaning out to speak to her. Oh dreadfully tiring says Miss —— taking her seat at the table with the reserved private bottle of soda water. And in complete desolation she waits for the courses to be brought."
1929.04.29,"And it is pouring. Oh this cold spring! Dry as a bone, though until today, but with never a blue sky. So that my red coat, which is like haws in winter, suits it. I heard the nightingale at Vita’s a week or two ago—the one warm night. And we were cold at Rodmell last week, when we went down to see Philcox, who will build two rooms for £320, & take only two months. It was cold; but how silent, how safe from voices & talk! How I resented our coming back; & quickly changed into the social sphere of my soul; & went to lunch with Sibyl; & there had, for my pains, precisely six minutes of tolerable talk with Max Beerbohm. But dear me, how little talk with great men now disturbs me. Are we all chilling & freezing, & do we look into each others old faces as into the craters of the moon? (These I saw silver white & like the spots that are made by water dropping into plaster of paris through Vita’s telescope the other day.) I begin to think that youth is the only tolerable thing to look at; & am taking Judy to the Coliseum on Wednesday.

I forgot to say that the pump has begun again & is grinding away at this moment. But I say I shall get used to it—certainly I shall.

This morning I began to revise Phases of Fiction, & with that done, I can see my way clear to a complete imaginative book.

Meanwhile, I am eddying quicker & quicker into the stream, into London: tomorrow Christabel; then Mauron’s lecture & Mary & the Keynes’ & the Eliots.

Poor Tom—a true poet, I think; what they will call in a hundred years a man of genius: & this is his life. I stand for half an hour listening while he says that Vivien cant walk. Her legs have gone. But whats the matter? No one knows. And so she lies in bed—cant put a shoe on. And they have difficulties, humiliations, with servants. And after endless quibbling about visiting—which he cant do these 8 weeks, owing to moving house & 15 first cousins come to England, suddenly he appears overcome, moved, tragic, unhappy, broken down, because I offer to come to tea on Thursday. Oh but we dont dare ask our friends, he said. We have been deserted. Nobody has been to see us for weeks. Would you really come—all this way? to see us? Yes I said. But what a vision of misery, imagined, but real too. Vivien with her foot on a stool, in bed all day; Tom hurrying back lest she abuse him: this is our man of genius.—This is what I gathered yesterday morning on the telephone."
1929.05.12,"Here, having just finished what I call the final revision of Women & Fiction so that L. can read it after tea, I stop: surfeited. And the pump, which I was so sanguine as to think ceased, begins again. About W. & F. I am not sure—a brilliant essay?—I daresay; it has much work in it, many opinions boiled down into a kind of jelly, which I have stained red as far as I can. But I am eager to be off—to write without any boundary coming slick in ones eyes: here my public has been too close: facts; getting them malleable, easily yielding to each other.

A wet day, or we should be at Hampton Court with Roger & Mauron. And I am glad of the rain, because I have talked too much. We have seen too many people—Sydney Waterlow perhaps the most notable, as a resurrection. A desperate looking pompous sad respectable elderly man; worldly; but quivering as usual in his shell. Any pin pricks him in the unarmoured skin. I liked him. We met in the dark hall, glad of its darkness. We talked almost too easily, of Lucy Clifford buried with a service; & then his lancers & state at Bangkok—all to his liking. His importance very clear to him. At Oare he is nobody. And so he would like to go back to Bangkok & be important in the East for ever. He can seek the truth no more—has indeed seen through the search for truth, which was in him the search for power. He believes in nothing any more, he said, & is convinced now that nothing will ever change him—So, talking of something else for a moment, he suddenly burst out into a terrific peroration about Spengler; who has changed the world for him—made infinitely more difference than anybody—so fixed & stable & independent is he.

Also we had a party: Roger a little old—to my mind he needs Nessa to fertilise & sweeten him. Some queer rancour often seems to exacerbate him. When his stomach heals his leg aches. And Plomer came—a little rigid, I fear; & too much of a gentleman; & little Blunden, the very image of a London house sparrow, that pecks & cheeps & is starved & dirty. And Julian, to me a very satisfactory young man at present; full of ardour, yet clear, precise; & genial too—with all his apostolic fervour & abstractedness a good fellow, warm, kindly; much more apt to see the good than the bad. For example he thought poor little grey mouse Jenkins very nice & very intelligent & sat screwed up on the floor at her feet. He had been consoling Topsy all the afternoon. For Topsy & Peter have separated. Yes they have separated for ever, owing to her flirtatious ways."
1929.05.13,"How odd this is—here I am sitting at 3.10 with nothing much to do—nothing that I need do. I must take up printing again. But we have been to the Singers with the car—its clutch in trouble; & as we started, up came Saxon, on his holiday—Going to the Ring of course, & having a day off. For how many years has he done this—strange methodical character that he is. We dont meet for months, & take up the subject again. He took out his cheque book & said he thought the pattern was changed, with the same interest in that minute detail as he had 30 years ago. He has the same umbrella hanging by a hook on his arm; the same gold watch chain; & his pirouetting attitudes; & sprightly bird-like ways.

What then has life given you, I asked, (myself) looking at the Church at the top of Portland Street. Well, he is free to go to the Opera, to read Plato to play chess. And he will continue doing these things, as if they were the chosen things till he dies. There is a certain dignity in this steady doing of things which seem chosen. Yet—thus one always ends a comparison of lives—I wouldn’t for the whole world live yours.

And at 4 I must change & wash & go to the Mauron lecture at Argyll House; & then to Molly & then to dine with Sibyl—which will, I hope finish this lap of my race. Did I say that I still think of life as a series of laps—& still take my fences dutifully & then enjoy nothingness? So if I dine with Sibyl I need not dine with Christabel. I have never got in the frame of mind which makes these fences negligible. Then we go to Rodmell for 6 days; & then home; & then to Cassis; & then home. & then Rodmell; & then the autumn; & then the winter—Oh this pump! I wish I could say I never notice it. Moreover, the idea has come to me that I ought now to be re-reading my own books, for our ‘Collected Edition’. L. & Kennedy are working at a dust cover this moment. Shall I run away from my duty & the pump & go & see?

The election draws near, & the Derby. I will go upstairs & read Proust I think, since I am fabricating a few remarks on him for that cursed book—that stone that plunges me deeper & deeper in the water. The reason I dislike dining with Sibyl is that she exacts it: I am to give her a display of intimacy, which she cannot acquire, poor woman, for herself."
1929.05.15,"This is written, as many pages in the past used to be written, to try a new pen; for I am vacillating—cant be sure to stick to the old pen any more. And then every gold pen has some fatal drawback. I make a note here that I will one of these days read the whole of Matthew Arnold. Never have I met one without. And then one cant be sure till one’s written a long screed. And then one’s ashamed to go back—& then one does—& then it all begins again, like Mathew Arnold’s river, or sea (brings in again &c &c).

I went to Sibyl’s dinner; but Heavens, how little real point there is to these meetings—save indeed that the food is good; & there is wine, & a certain atmosphere of luxury & hospitality. This, on the other hand, tends to drug one; one has been given something, for which one has to pay. And I don’t like that feeling. The old white haired baby [George Moore] sat propped up in his high chair; his hair now white like flax, like silk; his cheeks tinted a childs pink; his eyes with their marble hardness; his boneless ineffective hands. For some reason, he paid me compliments, indeed referred to me as an authority on English; & even offered, which I daresay was kindly meant, though nothing has happened, to send me one of his books.

What did we discuss? Mostly himself & his books, I think; & how he had known various old dim figures, far away in the past. I told them about Lord Alfred’s threat, & this launched him on stories about Robbie Ross, & his own lawsuits. But he is a detached shrewd old man; without many illusions & not very dependent on anyone, I should say. He wanted to walk back to Ebury Street, but it was raining & they made him take a cab. He talked about Henry James, & a proof sheet which nobody could read; & he said that a sentence ought to form like a cloud at the end of the pen—dont you think so? he said to me. These little compliments were due to my Geraldine & Jane which he said & references, was an admirable story & should be published as such. It had nothing to do with fact. And I rather think he will die soon—he has to have another operation; but in his detached way. I think these artists are slightly bored by all physical transactions. Let my body die, I can imagine him saying, so long as I can go on forming sentences at the end of my pen—& why not? Save that of course he says he enjoys the pleasures of the body. But that I rather doubt.

And I doubt too if Clive does. Clive is I fancy in bad odour everywhere at the moment, with his silly egotistic ways—writing to me to boast of a ‘mystery’, which it is clear that I am to impart; but I shant. He is like Lottie au fond; & Lottie by the way is dismissed; & is said to owe Karin £8 which she can’t pay, & great scenes take place, poor Adrian, as I imagine, moping & glooming in discomfort alone; with Karin savage & violent & competent spasmodically, rushing out to pay bills & put her house in order in ten minutes when she has neglected it all these years: sordid & squalid it all is, & hardly gives me any pleasure, to tell the truth, these sufferings of my friends.

I am depressed. Brace has done it. The oval faced sallow man. They want to keep W. & F., which I like, till the spring, & make P. of F. come out this autumn—a book I hate; & was, as I think, wrongly pressed to undertake. And then Roger wants to come to Rodmell, & I don’t like after my protests, to say no; & yet to have to talk & talk—& then Philcox can’t get my rooms done, all because of Durrant’s long waiting. So my wheel is turning low. & do I like this pen or dont I? Such are my sorrows Mr Wesley, as the man said when the servant put on too many coals.

What Clive says is that he has a mystery; something he cant share; & this annoys me too; the sensation mongering, like Dotty; the desire to be talked of. Oh, I say, if only I could plunge my mind into the delights of pure imagination, & so get some pull on this horrid world of real life!

But I must some how wind up this account of flies in the eye & go up to dinner & try to think of some cause of pleasure with Leonard. Something cheerful. Oh but then I must grind on at Proust, I suppose; & then copy out passages. Never mind, I will try my new pen & see if that doesn’t cheer me. Because clearly these miseries are very small trivial miseries, & fundamentally I am the happiest woman in all W.C.1. The happiest wife, the happiest writer, the most liked inhabitant, so I say, in Tavistock Square. When I count up my blessings, they must surely amount to more than my sorrows; even when I have all these flies in my eyes.

Well, what am I going to have for dinner? And I will hastily try my new pen on this last page, making it rapidly describe my complete renovation of domestic life—odd, I didn’t do it before: that I order dinner no longer; but write it in a book & thus put glass between me & Nelly.

Oh & George [Duckworth] rang up this morning. A French couple who admire me: could I lunch: & my teeth he says, drop out, while I talk, while I eat; & they preferred Brighton to Penshurst."
1929.05.28,"It is an odd summer, this one, unexampled perhaps in our history. We are going off to Cassis on Tuesday for a week. This is a revolution. We have never been abroad so late in the year I think. The Election will be over. We shall be governed by a Tory or a Labour party—Tory, I suppose. For the benefit of posterity I may say that nobody pretends to know, with the exception of the candidates. They are all—even Hubert—confident. And I feel, rather oddly, that this is an important election. Walking down the King’s Road with Sidney Waterlow the other night—having been to dine at his club off a mahogany table surrounded by the portraits of statesmen—I had a cocktail, but no wine—& it was a thundery day—Leonard had a headache—& we sat in the ladies reception room—a ducks egg coloured room with globes of light sending their light up, not down—very cool, smooth solid, something like sitting inside a shape of blanc mange—then said Sidney, feeling that something must be done, shall we go & see the Sangers? It was a thing that one ought to do. It would give them such pleasure. And he bought me 3 bunches of violets at the door from a woman who said it was her 40th wedding day: a tribute to my having once been asked in marriage by Sidney was it?—I held them in my hand all the evening, & we found the Sangers out; only a menial man came up from the basement. So we said we will call on the MacCarthys. And so it was that we walked along the King’s Road, talking about the Election. Sidney said that human nature has improved. We are all becoming gentler & wiser. Even the dogs are. One never sees a dog fight now he said, & sure enough the big mongrel trotted across the road very peacefully to sniff at the door of a public house. There the story stops. For I dont think much happened at the MacCarthys. One had to talk. I noticed nothing, I think. The memorable things happen when there is a great space of silence all round them perhaps. I dont know.

Now about this book, The Moths. How am I to begin it? And what is it to be? I feel no great impulse; no fever; only a great pressure of difficulty. Why write it then? Why write at all? Every morning I write a little sketch, to amuse myself.

I am not saying, I might say, that these sketches have any relevance. I am not trying to tell a story. Yet perhaps it might be done in that way. A mind thinking. They might be islands of light—islands in the stream that I am trying to convey: life itself going on. The current of the moths flying strongly this way. A lamp & a flower pot in the centre. The flower can always be changing. But there must be more unity between each scene than I can find at present. Autobiography it might be called. How am I to make one lap, or act, between the coming of the moths, more intense than another; if there are only scenes? One must get the sense that this is the beginning: this the middle; that the climax—when she opens the window & the moth comes in. I shall have the two different currents—the moths flying along; the flower upright in the centre; a perpetual crumbling & renewing of the plant. In its leaves she might see things happen. But who is she? I am very anxious that she should have no name. I dont want a Lavinia or a Penelope: I want ‘She’. But that becomes arty, Liberty, greenery yallery somehow: symbolic in loose robes. Of course I can make her think backwards & forwards; I can tell stories. But thats not it. Also I shall do away with exact place & time. Anything may be out of the window—a ship—a desert—London."
1929.05.31,"The oculist said to me this afternoon “Perhaps you’re not as young as you were”. This is the first time that has been said to me; & it seemed to me an astonishing statement. It means that one now seems to a stranger not a woman, but an elderly woman. Yet even so, though I felt wrinkled & aged for an hour, & put on a manner of great wisdom & toleration, buying a coat, even so, I forget it soon; & am ‘a woman’ again. Another light on my character or appearance—Coming up Southampton Row, a man snapped me & then said stop; & made me pay 6d for a silly little damp film, which I did not want; nor did I want to stay talking politics to a ferrety little rascal, having had little lunch. But my face marked me for his victim.

“We are winning” Nelly said at tea. I was shocked to think that we both desire the Labour party to win—why? partly that I dont want to be ruled by Nelly. I think to be ruled by Nelly & Lottie would be a disaster. It is dribbled out. Last night at Charleston we heard election results spoken very distinctly in the drawing room. Driving home through Lewes there was not a single light downstairs. No one was even listening in. The streets were perfectly empty. One man was pumpshipping against the station wall. I had imagined a crowd, flares, shouts, white sheets—only three black cats, out on business with the mice. So we shall be ruled by labour.

We went down to Worthing to see Leonard’s mother, laid like an old rose—rather lovely this time—in a narrow room; with the sea opposite. I watched the porpoises, & some reflections of people walking on the beach. And she cried; & was very dismal; & then rambled off about Caterham 50 years ago; & the Stannards, & how Herbert had rolled all the way down stairs, & drank so much milk that people were astonished. Nothing of life, as we see it, remains to her—only this curious lit up page of the past, which she turns over & over lying in bed; & cant read or sleep, yet anxiously demands, does Leonard think she will get well? We had been saying driving down that one should take poison. She has every reason; & yet demands more life, more life, at 78. She quarrels; she cant walk; she is alone; she is looked after by nurses; lives in an hotel, but demands more life, more life. One odd thing she said was that she had slept with a governess as a child who had given her a terrible disease, & been expelled from Holland on that account. I fancy she had never told anyone this; it was her offering of intimacy to us; a thanksgiving perhaps for our having come. I was moved by her; could hardly speak. I suppose human nature, so emotional, so irrational, so instinctive, as it is in her, but not in me, has this beauty; this what they call ‘elemental’ quality. One may get it too, when one is 76. One may lie sobbing, & yet cry does doctor think I shall recover? One will not perhaps go to the writing table & write that simple & profound paper upon suicide which I see myself leaving for my friends. What a day it was—the sea flowing in & out of the bays, all the way, like the Adriatic, or Pacific; & the sand yellow; & the boats steaming along; & behind the downs like long waves, gently extending themselves, to break very quickly; smooth & sloping like the waves. Even bungalows are all burnt up & made part of this beauty; made of vapour not zinc. We voted at Rodmell. I saw a white gloved lady helping an old farm couple out of her Daimler. We have bought a motor lawn mower. I liked Francis last night. He is so abundant & fertile, so generous & warm hearted A most divine man—a man I adore—these phrases recur. And then he amused me with his imitation of Esther talking like Macaulay [unexplained]. When they read the results he was always talking so loud: & had to stop short. We called in on Long Barn & left Pinker, & here we are again after one of these little journeys which seem to have last⁠[ed] 600 years. Everything looks a little strange & symbolical when one comes back. I was in a queer mood, thinking myself very old: but now I am a woman again—as I always am when I write. It is scattering & heatening, this motoring about."
1929.06.15,"Home last night from Cassis; that is to say from Arles. The hottest holiday I have ever had. And in some ways different from others; partly that it was so hot; then that we were alone with Nessa & Duncan; then that I have become, almost, a landowner. A window owner, anyhow. Yes, I almost bought La Boudard (& am not sure of the spelling) & have a contract, to go there at the cost of £2.10 a month. And this means an infinite number of things—perhaps a complete change; as buying a house so often does. Already this morning I feel an attachment—say a little island—floating some way off, but in my possession. And this island means heat, silence, complete aloofness from London; the sea; eating cakes in the new hotel at La Ciotat; driving off to Aix; sitting on the harbour dining; seeing the sardine boats come in; talk with people who have never heard of me & think me older, uglier than Nessa, & in every way inferior to her; that odd intimate, yet edgy, happy free yet somehow restrained intercourse with her & Duncan. It means also buying French books at Toulon & keeping them in my lovely cool room in the wood; Leonard in his shirtsleeves; an Eastern private life for us both; an Indian summer running in & out of the light of common day; a great deal of cheap wine & cigars; new alliances, with Currys, Cruthers, & other anomalous oddities—all this my engagement to make three windows at Boudard means to me.

I forget what the facts of our stay were. We were there for a week, coming the day before they expected us, oddly enough as we did last year. There was Duncan in his blue shirt; Angelica & Judith doing lessons on the terrace. Nessa drove Miss Campbell into the town & brought up the food every morning. I wrote a little article on Cowper, but lifting the words with difficulty in the heat, surrounded by black & white butterflies. And L. & I were very extravagant, for the first time in our lives, buying desks, tables, sideboards, crockery for Rodmell. This gave me pleasure; & set my dander up against Nessa’s almost overpowering supremacy. My elder son is coming tomorrow; yes, & he is the most promising young man in King’s; & has been speaking at the Apostles dinner. All I can oppose that with is, And I made £2,000 out of Orlando & can bring Leonard here & buy a house if I want. To which she replies (in the same inaudible way) I am a failure as a painter compared with you, & cant do more than pay for my models. And so we go on; over the depths of our childhood. Do you remember going down to the town to fetch—which ancient memories Duncan cannot share. He was divinely charming; & praised Nessa too. I put in shred after shred of feeling so that one may compose the salad, & am now running out to get my books from Riley if I can.

[Diary XIX]"
1929.06.15,"Against all laws, I am going to make this the first volume of a diary, though as ill luck has it, it is not even the first of the month. But it is the fault of practical life. I can’t write any longer in books whose leaves perish. I don’t know how to keep them. Here in a bound volume, the year has a chance of life. It can be stood on a shelf.

Pinker has just come home, very fat. And a sense of nothingness rolls about the house; what I call the sense of “Where there is nothing.” This is due to the fact that we came back from France last night & are not going round in the mill yet. Time flaps on the mast—my own phrase I think. There are things I ought to do. I ought to correct A Room of one’s own: I ought to read & correct the Common Reader. I ought to write several dull silly letters; to gentlemen in Maidstone & Kingston who tell me facts about dahlias; to Sir Philip Sassoon who most unexpectedly sends me, by motor car, his book of travels. But I cant—not for five minutes or so. Time flaps on the mast. And then I see through everything. Perhaps the image ought to have been one that gives an idea of a stream becoming thin: of seeing to the bottom. Lytton once said,—I connect it with a visit to Kew Gardens—that we can only live if we see through illusion. & that reminds me (it is odd by the way, how small a thought is which one cannot express pictorially, as one has been accustomed to thinking it: this saying of Lytton’s has always come pictorially, with heat, flowers, grass, summer, & myself walking at Kew) reminds me how the day before we went Lytton came, & we talked about Elizabeth & Essex. This was for the first time. And it was painful, because he minded what we had not said; & we had, to some extent to say it; but it was also a relief, on both sides, because we were glad to say it, & have this reserve over; & glad, I daresay, that Lytton minded; I daresay there was some discreditable element, at least in my gladness; yet not much. I daresay, among my disagreeables, is this that I am jealous enough of other writers to be glad when they are made to own their failures; but this was trifling. More important much was the relief that one could say openly that one had disliked E & E for such reasons; & we began to go into them. His suppression of irony; his being tied by the story; the difficulty of using reality imaginatively; a wrong subject for him; could only be treated exactly. He said he had been very doubtful himself; & this is what I liked—that though his surrounders—Carrington Dadie & the rest—all praised, he himself felt, he was not pleased unless we Bloomsbury, praised too. What we said mattered. And I daresay, owing to success, he minds these reservations a great deal more than I should; for I kept thinking of all the criticism I had had. One is pleased when after long yea⁠[r]⁠s’ such feelings have sway. And I felt, among the discreditable feelings, how I had no longer anything to envy him for; & how, dashing off Orlando I had done better than he had done; & how for the first time I think, he thought of me, as a writer, with some envy. Yet he amused me by protesting that to write like that would be to write like Virginia—a fatal event, it seems.

Now time must not flap on the mast any more. Now I must somehow brew another decoction of illusion. Well, if the human interest flags—if its that that worries me, I must not sit thinking about it here. I must make human illusion—ask someone in tomorrow after dinner; & begin that astonishing adventure with the souls of others again—about which I know so little. Is it affection that prompts?"
1929.06.16,"As I finished those words, in came Leonard to say that Desmond was coming round in two minutes—which he did, so that the sail filled out again & the ship went on. (The reason why I write this is that I cannot go on correcting A Room of one’s own. I have read till my own sentences jingle in my ear—& so I begin to make more). Desmond was shabby & baggy in grey. He was bubbling & simmering, off to dine with Crompton Davies at Kettner’s, & determined to be punctual. A vein of determination lies in him; & he is the most cooked & saturated of us all. Not an atom remains crude; basted richly over a slow fire—an adorable man, a divine man, as Francis would say, for all his power of taking the spine out of me. Happily we did not get on to that—writing that is to say. Julian broke down in his Apostle speech; came dressed as for a ball, & got muddled in his notes & sat down; but with his admirable Stephen solidity did not mind. Also Desmond lost £5; to Lord Rothermere, & another man lost £2,000, over the Election. What circles you live in, said Leonard; & he said that this was only due to the Empire Review. Maynard he said looked as if he were conscious of discord at the Apostle dinner. We talked of Lytton’s books. But talk ran into talk; nothing could be spread out; he must not be late for Crompton. He (C.) lives in Gledhow Terrace, with two leather chairs in the dining room; behind it his bedroom; he has his Virgil & a Milton that Desmond gave him. My Milton, said Leonard; & I offered to give Desmond a new despatch box. Off he went talking all the way. And Pinker came back &—"
1929.06.23,"It was very hot that day, driving to Worthing to see Leonard’s mother, my throat hurt me. Next morning I had a headache. So we stayed on at Rodmell till today. At Rodmell I read through the Common Reader; & this is very important—I must learn to write more succinctly. Especially in the general idea essays like the last, How it strikes a Contemporary, I am horrified by my own looseness. This is partly that I dont think things out first; partly that I stretch my style to take in crumbs of meaning. But the result is a wobble & diffusity & breathlessness which I detest. One must correct A room of one’s own very carefully before printing. And so I pitched into my great lake of melancholy. Lord how deep it is! What a born melancholiac I am! The only way I keep afloat is by working. A note for the summer I must take more Aug. 31st This vow I kept work than I can possibly get done. (I am)—no, I dont know what it comes from. Directly I stop working I feel that I am sinking down, down. And as usual, I feel that if I sink further I shall reach the truth. That is the only mitigation; a kind of nobility. Solemnity. I shall make myself face the fact that there is nothing—nothing for any of us. Work, reading, writing are all disguises; & relations with people. Yes, even having children would be useless.

We went into the beechwood by the Race Course. I like these woods; & the waters of the greenery closing over one; so shallow, with the sun on them; then so deep in the shade. And I like the beech boughs, laced about, very intricate; like many arms; & the trunks, like the stone pillars in a church. But if I were Mrs Bartholomew I should certainly do something violent. This thought kept coming to me. What though could one do, at the bottom of that weight⁠[?]; with that incubus of injustice on top of one? Annie Thompsett & her baby live on 15/ a week. I throw away 13/- on cigarettes, chocolates, & bus fares. She was eating rice pudding by the baby’s cradle when I came in.

However, I now begin to see the Moths rather too clearly, or at least strenuously, for my comfort. I think it will begin like this: dawn; the shells on a beach; I dont know—voices of cock & nightingale; & then all the children at a long table—lessons. The beginning. Well, all sorts of characters are to be there. Then the person who is at the table can call out any one of them at any moment; & build up by that person the mood, tell a story; for instance about dogs or nurses; or some adventure of a childs kind; all to be very Arabian nights; & so on: this shall be Childhood; but it must not be my childhood; & boats on the pond; the sense of children; unreality; things oddly proportioned. Then another person or figure must be selected. The unreal world must be round all this—the phantom waves. The Moth must come in: the beautiful single moth. There must be a flower growing.

Could one not get the waves to be heard all through? Or the farmyard noises? Some odd irrelevant noises. She might have a book—one book to read in—another to write in—old letters.

Early morning light—but this need not be insisted on; because there must be great freedom from ‘reality’. Yet everything must have relevance.

Well all this is of course the ‘real’ life; & nothingness only comes in the absence of this. I have proved this quite certainly in the past half hour. Everything becomes green & vivified in me when I begin to think of the Moths. Also, I think, one is much better able to enter into other’s—"
1929.06.30,"I broke off; somebody I imagine interrupted. My melancholy has been broken, like a lake by oars, since I wrote. I have been so active. We have seen so many people. Last night we dined with Roger, tonight with Clive; Lytton came; Vita came; we had a party. I brought a dress in Shaftesbury Avenue. It was very hot, I think; & is now cold, indeed, for the first time for weeks, it is, or has been raining. I am writing idly, to solace my eyes after two hours of intense correction—that much corrected book, Women & Fiction. It shall go to the printer tomorrow I swear. And then I can bask entirely in the light of some fiction. But I have written myself out of that mood, & find it difficult to get back to it. This last half year I made over £1800; almost at the rate of £4000 a year; the salary almost of a Cabinet minister; & time was, two years ago, when I toiled to make £200. Now I am overpaid I think for my little articles—And I still think that the great pleasure of prosperity is to be able to go into a shop & buy a pocket knife. Well, after tomorrow I shall close down article writing, & give way to fiction for six or seven months—till next March perhaps. And I here record my intention to see to the writing of this new book much more carefully; to strike out redundancies. Now that I have, I think, gained the free use of my pen, I must begin to curb it. Hitherto my freedom has had to be fought for.

Helen Anrep last night was distracted & worried, like a wet overblown Rose. Baba got out of her bed & went on the roof & fell asleep there. So Miss Cox proposes to put her down into a lower class for a year. And Roger had news that her Hampstead House was falling down; would need £500 spent on it. And how could she live on the income of £3,000 if she sold it to the Hampstead Hospital? The other day in Paris she thought she was going to have a child by Roger. “And I’ve failed utterly with the children I have—And I feel a hundred.” So she plained & crooned, sitting beside Roger, with her hand on the arm of his chair. Sometimes he put his hand on hers. They were affectionate & private; this is Roger’s private life. And it keeps him happy, while superficially he whirls from doctor to doctor; & springs & spins, & looks out places on the map—unable not to verify & track down any statement, however pointless. He told us how in some great French cave, there is a patch of green vegetation wherever the torchlight has fallen. And Mauron ran his hand along a ledge & thought it was moss. But it was bats dung. The bats fly up into the air.

Desmond is being very brilliant about the Byron letters & the Boswell papers. Think! There are 18 volumes of Boswell’s diaries now to be published. With any luck I shall live to read them. I feel as if some dead person were said to be living after all—an odd effect, this disinterment of a mass more of Boswell when one had thought all was known, all settled. And father never knew; & Sir Edmund Gosse is dead. These papers were in a cabinet in Ireland.

And now it is almost time for lunch; & after lunch I must again read my book; with a view, if possible, to shortening & condensing the last pages."
1929.08.05,"Yes that is the date, & the last was June 30th—a tribute to the helter skelter random rackety summer I spent. Far the pleasantest memories, standing out like greenweed on some civet grey pond, were the week ends here: the divine fresh week ends, with the hay cutting & the lights lambent; Leonard’s new room, Hedgehog Hall a-building, & my lodge being made into the palace of comfort which it now is. For I am now sitting here, oppressed by the Bank holiday atmosphere which gets into the wild country air, the lonely marshes, & makes the village seem smug & suburban. The girls & men are playing stool ball; Leonard & Percy are making a pipe conduct water into the Pond. It is a chocolate brown, & lived in by small fish. Yes it was a scattered summer; I felt as if the telephone were strung to my arm & anybody could jerk me who liked. A sense of interruption bothered me. And then these people one ‘sees’—how blurred the image becomes! What damp blotting paper my mind was, as I left Ottoline’s on Thursday afternoon, & determined not to speak to another soul. There is a sort of irreverence in treating thus the venerable soul of man: one curses it, & bites it & gets embittered by it. More pleasure is to be had from one nights talk with old dunderheaded Ka than from these flittering & glitterings. In London I should only have girded at her. Here, spreading herself out in her slow heavy footed way one took in an easy half critical, half appreciative impression—the chief element being amusement at her protestations. When the story was not to her credit as a social centre, it was to his as a speaker, politician, gardener, artist, husband, thinker—everything. Indeed I cut her short this morning, as she exalted his brain, by saying we all live on illusion; Will’s brain is one of them. Thus pulled up she jibbed a moment, & then recovered, & saw the sense; not quite, perhaps; but in her slow way, larded over with these shams & gentilities & politics & appearances, she is honest too. And we talked about Rupert. But my reflection—every visit leaves one with a reflection—was this, about talking in protest, to impress, its futility, its universality: only she is more open & insistent, for some reason, than we are—or so I hope. Take away that motive from one’s talk, & how much would be left? How often don’t I vaguely feel blessing my sentence, the face of my own vanity, which demands that I shall pay it this tribute.

And then I’m cross with Vita: she never told me she was going abroad for a fortnight—didnt dare; till the last moment, when she said it was a sudden plan. Lord Lord! I am half amused though; why do I mind? what do I mind? how much do I mind? I shall fire up & accuse her, & see to the bottom of her vessel. One of the facts is that these Hildas are a chronic case; & as this one won’t disappear & is unattached, she may be permanent. And, like the damned intellectual snob I am, I hate to be linked, even by an arm, with Hilda. Her earnest aspiring competent wooden face appears before me, seeking guidance in the grave question of who’s to broadcast. A queer trait in Vita—her passion for the earnest middle-class intellectual, however drab & dreary. And why do I write this down? I have not even told Leonard; & whom do I tell when I tell a blank page? The truth is, I get nearer feelings in writing than in walking [sic]—I think: graze the bone; enjoy the expression; have them out of me; make them a little creditable to myself; I daresay suppress something, so that after all I’m doing what amounts to confiding. Why did Pepys write his diary after all?

I should be tackling Mary Wollstonecraft. I am in the thick of my four Herald articles, thus cutting into my Moths (but I had proofs of A Room to correct) & hope to be quit of it all by August 14th & then go down step by step into that queer region. I must make a great try for it—for this difficult book—& after that? Always adventure: with that sense to guide me, I shant stagnate anyhow.

You can choose between us, I say, stopping writing; & get some satisfaction from making up caustic phrases. Yet I’m not very caustic, only by starts."
1929.08.08,"This is written to while away one of those stupendous moments—one of those painful, ridiculous, agitating moments which make one half sick & yet I dont know—I’m excited too; & feel free Another scene, Aug. 30th; but these reflections stood me in good stead—& I laughed. But what a confounded bore it is & then sordid; & unsettled; & so on—I’ve told Nelly to go; after a series of scenes which I wont bore myself to describe. And in the midst of the usual anger, I looked into her little shifting greedy eyes, & saw nothing but malice & spite there, & felt that that had come to be the reality now: she doesn’t care for me, or for anything: has been eaten up by her poor timid servants fears & cares & respectabilities. And so at lunch L. & I settled it; & I spoke two words, which she almost pulled out of my mouth in her eagerness to show herself delighted & eager & hard & untouched—a sordid painful scene after 15 years; but then how many I have had, & how degrading they are. & if we dont break now we drift on endlessly—oh but all these old arguments I know by heart. Whats new & strange is to have made an end of it, for though we only speak of her staying away till October, I dont think we shall ever begin again. This is an occasion for some of the small virtues of life—cheerfulness, & decision, & the determination to start fresh & better. In truth we never should have gone on, I daresay, if it hadn’t been for the war; I dont know: I’m confirmed in my wish to have no resident servants ever again. That is the evil which rots the relationship. But now I must go to Annie Thomsett again."
1929.08.10,"Well, Heaven be praised; it is all over & calm & settled. Nelly—how long ago that seems!—is staying—Yes, we found we cdnt get Mrs Thomsett; & I had two minutes of energetic courage; & so, Nelly saying, she thought—but I’m too bored. And I’m too deliciously relieved to have seen Vita this moment & find that her story to me was precisely true—& she brought documents to prove it—& was very upset—& had gone like a donkey & telephoned to Hilda—who is also very upset, & was altogether so simple & sincere & saw that my position was reasonable—oh yes, she could not have stood it a moment—but why, I ask myself, does it bore me so insufferably to write down what is so acutely exciting at the moment? My own lack of narrative power. Indeed I was more worried & angry & hurt & caustic about this affair than I let on, even to the blank page; yet afraid too of exaggeration. Of course, one is right about Nelly—right that she is, in bad moods almost insufferably mean, selfish & spiteful; but—& this is an interesting psychological remark, she is in a state of nature; untrained; uneducated, to me almost incredibly without the power of analysis or logic; so that one sees a human mind wriggling undressed—which is interesting; & then, in the midst of one’s horror at the loathesome spectacle, one is surprised by the goodness of human nature, undressed; & it is more impressive because of its undress. For example, she thought I had given her notice permanently; but instead of giving way,—& yet she had nowhere to go to—to rage or spite, she bicycled into Lewes to get us cream for dinner: the motive being genuine I think; we must not suffer; & how could she leave us without a cook? It is this mixture that one can’t understand; & that makes one always plunge so heavily in dealing with her. She said too that she would find it very difficult to get a place; since it is all the fashion now to engage cooks only who will live out (& this sentence is another example of my inability to write narrative). And it will happen again, her spite & meanness; but we shan’t part now, I think. And I’m half pleased to find that it is harder to part after 15 years than I thought. And I’m pleased—oh very pleased—about Vita."
1929.08.15,"These tumults over, then I had a headache. And two ideas come to me—to break my rule & write about the soul for once; & to write some exact dialogue: I just note this, it being dinner time.

We are back from Brighton where I brought a corner cupboard. And if I had time, I would here dissect a curious little spotted fruit: this melancholy. It comes with headache, of course. And I had come to the blind alley—the cul de-sac. Writing this compressed article, where every word is like a step cut in the rock—hard work, if ever writing was; & done largely for money; & whats money, compared with Nessa’s children; & then the—"
1929.08.19,"I suppose dinner interrupted. And I opened this book in another train of mind—to record the blessed fact that for good or bad I have just set the last correction to Women & Fiction, or a Room of One’s Own. I shall never read it again I suppose. Good or bad? Has an uneasy life in it I think: you feel the creature arching its back & galloping on, though as usual much is watery & flimsy & pitched in too high a voice.

William Plomer has been for the week end & gone. A compressed inarticulate young man, thickly coated with a universal manner fit for all weather & people: tells a nice dry prim story; but has the wild eyes which I once noted in Tom, & take to be the true index of what goes on within. Once or twice he almost cracked his crust—sitting on the stones this morning for instance.

I dont suppose you know how separate I feel myself from all my contemporaries. I am afraid I was very inadequate last night (at Charleston). I apologised for the family party. No that was delightful; except that Clive Bell seemed inharmonious. What d’you think of Wyndham Lewis, of Joyce? (V.) I dont like scolds. It spoils the voice. I like old men of 80 like Moore & Yeats who have kept their minds working. “Exactly. That’s the precise point” (these are William’s words). And fathers are difficult. Mine has no interest in anything. But I dont live at Pinner for choice. I dislike Roy Campbell’s pose. He used to fly a kite at the end of a fishing rod. William (he said the Mr was awkward) is notably trying to be like other people: to justify his life among natives & colonels, which has given him this composure. Beside him Julian seemed a mere child, & Duncan a contemporary. May he bring Butts to see us? He is a very self-contained independent young man, determined not to be rushed in any way, & having no money at all, he gave Nelly 5/ for a tip. I think he shows up well against the Raymonds & the Frankies—is somehow solid; to their pinchbeck lustre.

I have now written myself out of a writing mood; & cannot attack melancholy, save only to note that it was much diminished by hearing Nessa say she was often melancholy & often envied me—a statement I thought incredible. I have spilt myself among too many stools she said (we were sitting in her bedroom before dinner). Other peoples melancholy certainly cheers one. And now, having written my four little brief hard articles, I must think of that book again, & go down step by step into the well. These are the great events & revolutions in one’s life—& then people talk of war & politics. I shall grind very hard; all my brakes will be stiff; my springs rusty. But I have now earned the right to some months of fiction. & my melancholy is brushed away, so soon as I can get my mind forging ahead, not circling round."
1929.08.21,"Geoffrey Scott died last week of pneumonia in New York. Let me think what I can remember of him. I met him first in 1909 at Florence at Mrs Berenson’s. We went out for lunch, & he was there; & they discussed Francis Thompson. Afterwards we went to a party at Mrs Ross’s: Mary came in with a brother, both disguised as Barnes, & had to reveal themselves as Stracheys before Mrs Ross would take any interest. Then she emphasised the fact that she was Meredith’s mistress, leading us all down a lawn;—a terrace I suppose, overlooking Fiesole. I was unhappy that summer, & bitter in all my judgments; & cannot remember anything of Geoffrey Scott save that he was part of that unnatural Florentine society; & therefore in my mood, rather contemptible—long & familiar & aesthetic & at his ease, where I was rustic, provincial & badly dressed. This impression then waits without a second till that summer evening, in 1925, I think, at Long Barn. I had motored down with Dotty & Vita for my first visit & had sat shyly in the motor observing their endearments rather awkwardly, & how they stopped the Rolls Royce to buy great baskets of strawberries; & again I felt, not provincial, but ill-dressed, under-equipped; & so stepped on to the terrace at Long Barn; & forth came Geoffrey, smiling a little superciliously, as of old; & shook hands. Harold [Nicolson] was behind him, much more downright & burly & to my taste. That night we sat in the long room, & after Harold had grown sleepy sitting on the fender knocking his head against the fringe of the Italian cover on the mantelpice, Geoffrey sat with us, & was drawn by Dotty into telling stories for my amusement. He did this very well; I remember, though I dont remember what the stories were about. He was a very clever man, I thought; & I tried to place him, & concluded that he had some grudge against me as member of a circle he somehow respected but was not of; told me, I remember, that he could not distinguish an article by me in the Nation from one by Morgan or Lytton—we all wrote the same ironic style—& that I felt was said by way of showing me—& we were the two scallywags at that particular party—that he was up to our little ways & had no respect for them. Then next day we went over Knole, where again, as at Florence, he was very much at his ease, & knew every piece of furniture or silver & called Lord Sackville Lionel as if he had known him & Vita familiarly many years, just as he had known the Rosses & the Berensons. And he was tall, & dark & had the distinguished face of a failure; reminded me a little of Bernard Holland & other ‘brilliant’ young men, who remain ‘brilliant’ & young well into the 40ties & never do anything to prove it. Harold walked back through the Park to think out some speech about Byron, simply & straightforwardly, rather to my & I think Geoffrey’s amusement. The others—Dotty Vita & Geoffrey—took me to the station; & I said goodbye to him there, & never spoke to him again. I had the feeling that he & Dotty & Vita & Harold were all a set; very intimate & familiar, & indeed said so, when they challenged me, as usual, with Bloomsbury & its closed walls. “But you are the same—you make me feel that you are all very intimate” I said, & they half denied it; but only half. For, as I learnt later, I had broken in upon the height of his affair with Vita. It was flaming very strongly that particular month, or week; it was the time when she returned his passion, for a moment; when he was swearing that she must leave Harold & live with him. After that, my intercourse with him was only by hearsay—through messages—Karin said her mother wished her to arrange a meeting between Geoffrey & me—& then through Vita’s explanations, later, when she told me how he was waiting for her, had left his Villa Medici & Lady Sybil on her account; & was now fuming in a mews off Regent’s Park expecting her while she sat at Tavistock Square talking to me. One night, she said, he almost strangled her—seized her by the throat; & she turned black & he was frightened. And I heard how furious he was on the downs above Rodmell that summer, late at night, when they were driving home, from Lady Sackville I suppose. Vita saw lights in the valley & said that I was down there asleep. Whereupon he flew into another rage—they were calling the dogs who had gone hunting, & the wind blew his hat off. He called me ‘that woman’. And I saw him, in full evening dress, at the ballet with Sybil [Colefax]. And then never again.

He is dead in New York, & all those papers about Boswell—what will become of them; & the life that was to have made him immortal will never be written; & he remains the I was offered £2000 to write it brilliant young man for ever.

And I have turned over two pages by mistake. Perhaps I can think of some other figure to write in there, going backwards, before I need go in: & it is a lovely evening; & I want to stay out here writing, & trying my new pen.

Nobody has died, to my knowledge, of much interest. And if it comes to putting down talk, the truth is that, except in novels, people don’t talk.

Well, Bernard Holland, as I have mentioned him. But I cannot put my hand on any first meeting or even second. I believe I first heard him mentioned when I was say ten years old; & he had just become engaged to Helen Duckworth. Stella said to mother, “But can they know what he thinks then?”—or words which made me surmise that there was something dark & queer about this young man; something that to Stella seemed incongruous with the rusticity & conventionality of her Duckworth aunt & uncle. Then that little light, revealing as it was, goes out; & there is only hearsay about Bernard till, in 1902 or 3 perhaps, Dorothea took me uninvited to stay at Canterbury with Canon Holland; & there was Bernard; & he was saturnine, with his great eyebrows almost meeting; & his sunk cheeks; & his gloom; & his height; & about him there hung, now more authentically, that reputation for brilliance & strangeness that was his, years ago, at Cambridge. Poor old Bernard—he’s a genius, I once heard Harry Stephen say. He interested me because I imputed to him ‘imagination’—the quality I most admired & missed most in my father & his agnostic friends. Bernard had edited his mother’s letters, & I liked them in a sentimental way, seeing in them something imaginative, too; something that was coloured & pensive & intimate, unlike anything the Stephen family produced. So that I looked at Bernard in the low room under the Cathedral with interest, & even hoped he might think me clever or imaginative or something. But I doubt that he detached me from the shadow of Dorothea. He was occupied & mysterious, in touch with politics & Cabinet ministers; highly thought of by the Lytteltons, & vaguely credited with being himself much more able & capable than they were; but he was too much of a genius, too queer & individual, so people said, to do anything for himself. And Helen played up to this version of Bernard very femininely; wandering about vague eyed, cherry cheeked, ecstatic, religious; like some woman I thought in a novel by Charlotte Yonge. We were taken to see a sister of Mary Sibylla’s, & she said, clasping her tea cup, that whenever she heard thunder she imagined that someone had been killed by it. There was all that kind of imagination afloat. Bernard stalked about in it, aloof, intellectual, silent; appreciative perhaps, but never said so. Helen played little melancholy scraps of Beethoven; which moved me; but Bernard snapped “Whats that? Gilbert & Sullivan?” to snub her sentimentality I suppose. And then, when there was talk of going back in the train together, he stopped it. He said that he must be alone & work. So I suppose I made no impression; & received one that was not altogether favourable. A sort of false gloom was his I thought; unless indeed he were tremendously imaginative. I read a book he wrote anonymously about becoming a Roman Catholic & got a faint seductive whiff of a world where people were very brilliant & thought about their souls; a semi-worldly world it seemed; rather fluent; rather too clear & plausible & pensive, but still attractive & unfamiliar. And then again I met him at Ottoline’s; & then I was older, & he was more pronounced. That is he was still sardonic; cavernous; but no longer so lean, or so silent. He flirted, even I could see, with Ottoline; & had become one of those distinguished young men who are very brilliant when they dine out—like Herbert Paul perhaps; they appear without their wives, who are deaf or mad; influence politics; write unsigned articles; & flirt with ladies of title. Ottoline told me that Bernard had written her a sonnet, after another dinner party. And then he turned Roman Catholic. He wrote a vast life of the Duke of Devonshire; he wrote a vast history of the Holland family; but that was all that came of his gloom & his imagination & his genius, & when he died, a year or two ago, even his friends never wrote to the Times about him."
1929.08.22,"And so I might fill up the half hour before dinner writing.

I thought, on my walk that I would begin at the beginning: I get up at half past eight & walk across the garden. Today it was misty & I had been dreaming of Edith Sitwell. I wash & go into breakfast which is laid on the check table cloth. With luck I may have an interesting letter; today there was none. And then bath & dress; & come out here & write or correct for three hours, broken at 11 by Leonard with Milk, & perhaps newspapers. At one luncheon—rissoles today & chocolate custard. A brief reading & smoking after lunch; & at about two I change into thick shoes, take Pinker’s lead & go out—up to Asheham hill this afternoon, where I sat a minute or two, & then home again, along the river. Tea at four, about; & then I come out here & write several letters, interrupted by the Post, with another invitation to lecture; & then I read one book of the Prelude. And soon the bell will ring, & we shall dine & then we shall have some music, & I shall smoke a cigar; & then we shall read—La Fontaine I think tonight & the papers—& so to bed. Here I will copy some lines I want to remember,

The matter that detains us now may seem,

To many, neither dignified enough

Nor arduous, yet will not be scorned by them,

Who, looking inward, have observed the ties

That bind the perishable hours of life

Each to the other, & the curious props

By which the world of memory & thought

Exists & is sustained.



They are from the 7th book of the Prelude. A very good quotation I think.

But my skeleton day needs reviving with all sorts of different colours. Today it was grey & windy on the walk; yesterday generous & open; a yellow sun on the corn; & heat in the valley. Both days differ greatly; both are among the happiest of my life—I mean among the happy undistinguished days, ripe & sweet & sound; the daily bread; for nothing strange or exalted has happened; only the day has gone rightly & harmoniously; a pattern of the best part of life which is in the country like this; & makes me wish to command more of them—months of them.

Now my little tugging & distressing book & articles are off my mind my brain seems to fill & expand & grow physically light & peaceful. I begin to feel it filling quietly after all the wringing & squeezing it has had since we came here. And so the unconscious part now expands; & walking I notice the red corn, & the blue of the plain & an infinite number of things without naming them; because I am not thinking of any special thing. Now & again I feel my mind take shape, like a cloud with the sun on it, as some idea, plan, or image wells up, but they travel on, over the horizon, like clouds, & I wait peacefully for another to form, or nothing—it matters not which.

One picture I saw—Phil Burne Jones sitting in the square of St Mark’s, in evening dress, alone one August night in 1912—for we were on our honeymoon. He looked dissipated & lonely, like a pierrot who had grown old & rather peevish. He wore a light overcoat & sat, his foolish nervous white face looking aged & set unhappy & eager & disillusioned, alone at a little marble table, while everyone else paraded or chattered & the band played—he had no companion—none of his smart ladies—nobody to chatter to, in his affected exaggerated voice; paying astonishing compliments, using dears & darlings & going into that once fashionable whinny of laughter which must I think have come down from Burne Jones himself—& Phil was a kind of dissipated degenerate, spending all the thousands that were paid for those wan women on staircases, on love affairs, on luxuries, on being a fashionable bachelor & fairy God father to the Trees & Taylors & other fashionable young ladies—a very timid conventional man at bottom, with a horrid taste in pictures, presumably, but a way with children. Lowell noticed that at St Ives. And I am still grateful for pictures that he drew for us. He belongs to the gallery of brilliant young men of 50, for he died a year or two ago.

The best part of my walk this afternoon was certainly on the top of the down leading to Juggs Corner.

Yes, yes, but that is days ago. I saw a woman in white sitting against soft snow banks of blue & white sky; & a child in blue: I saw all the downs glooming & brightening. But it is now"
1929.09.02,"& I am writing these words because Lyn (yes, she is Lyn) is reading in the garden, & I am talk-dried, & cant begin the Moths as I should, or patch up finally those old articles. A long day it was yesterday—rather exhausting—hard work talking to someone one hardly knows in the orchard. A very nice young woman, with that essential bareness—I cant think of the word—that young women so often have—without illusions, about herself; an honesty bred of poverty. Keeping going on £200 a year in London which she earns. Pays her way week by week on articles; & her father has £600 as a presbyterian minister in Aberdeen, & will have £400 to retire on, & has 5 children. So that she will never have a penny of her own. All this breeds a kind of veracity & clear sightedness & austerity which I prefer, perhaps, to the lush undergrowth which surrounds Dotty. One gardener more or less, one persian pot more or less, what does it matter—her life is crowded & otiose; but Lyn knows every object in her room, & has saved up & bought them by saving so that they are exact & polished. Well, but of her? Oh I’m so sick of talk, & analysis.

This book would form in me could I let my mind lie asleep, calm like a tideless sea; but all this time I’m breaking my mind up; destroying the growth underneath. Never mind, after tomorrow when I go to Vita, solitude begins* * This was a sanguine guess—not fulfilled I shall ruminate for a month. Lyn has this austerity. She is direct & sensible; goes to the W.C. frankly; but is not sexually advanced I should say; has had no indulgences with young men or wine; has something cool headed & sensible about her, derived from her theological father, her Scots farmer birth no doubt. She has been trained in English literature & is, what young women so seldom are, or were, a trained critic. She gives her opinion precisely & methodically, rather as Janet Vaughan would do on a case. (Janet was here last week end, by the way.) This trained mind is new & rather strange. It seems to eliminate enthusiasm, perhaps too drastically. Its odd to find everything weighed & criticised. & words of sobriety & insight issuing from this innocent round pink face; these candid blue eyes. She will spend money on face powder—went to buy a special brand & bought a cactus instead. Oh & she told a story about the dead man on the sands. She & Enid Welsford were motoring. One night they came to a bay & Enid wanted to walk to a long stretch of sand. So they went; & Lyn saw a coat & a pair of boots in the sand; & found it was a dead man. She stopped & went back, giving Enid the slip, not thinking that children might find it; absolutely horrified; her first sight of a dead person. This was made vivid to me. Enid came back. Did you see something? Yes I saw it. So they told the villagers. The man had been unhappily married & had seemed depressed & so killed himself, to be found that sad grey night—his boots sticking out of the sand, the face I suppose very ghastly.

I have just read a page or two of Samuel Butler’s notebooks to take the taste of Alice Meynell’s life out of my mouth. One rather craves brilliance & cantankerousness. Yet I am interested; a little teased by the tight airless Meynell style; & then I think what they had that we had not—some suavity & grace, certainly. They believed in things & we didn’t; & she had 7 children & wrote about 5 paragraphs a day for society papers & so on—all the time looking like a crucified saint; & was also very merry & witty perhaps—anyhow absolutely steeped in various sorts of adventure & life—went to America lecturing & made £15 a lecture, which she sent back to help Wilfrid. But it is not exactly this that I mean. When one reads a life one often compares one’s own life with it. And doing this I was aware of some sweetness & dignity in those lives compared with ours—even with ours at this moment. Yet in fact their lives would be intolerable—so insincere, so elaborate; so I think—all this word paring & sweetness & charity. Viola cant help dropping in lump after lump of sugar—only two sharp & therefore memorable things survive—her mother failed as a friend. She never gave enough. Old Coventry Patmore, whom she thought the equal of Sh⁠[akespea]⁠re, complained that he had lost the primacy among her friends & dropped out; whereupon she went alone into the drawing room, for she hated to express her feelings, & also hated long accounts of illness & death in biographies, turning her face away from her son in her last illness, & letting him only kiss her hand. Secondly there was the oddity of her admiration for Chesterton. Had I been a man & very big I could have been Chesterton. That is, her views were all peculiar & angular, & stuck to pedantically. She had a line of her own. But it would be a wonderful relief if Viola would give up being pointed & precise & tell us something casual & familiar—only she cant: her mind in stays. Katherine Mansfield described a visit to the house in Sussex—All the Ms. in barns & cottages; & the daughters singing long monotonous ballads, & then, by way of contrast & to surprise a scallywag I daresay with their liveliness breaking into music hall songs taught them by their brothers in law. Katherine described them like so many B⁠[urne]. J⁠[ones]. mermaids with long lush hair, plucking at mediaeval instruments & intoning those verses. Mrs M. sat by. And I saw her in 1910 (?) at Mrs Ross’s, & heard her say that saying about the climate & then there she was ecstatic in an omnibus.—I recorded my regret that one ever saw poetesses in the flesh. For she was a poetess too—it strikes me that one or two little poems will survive all that my father ever wrote. But its odd—this comparing that goes on as one reads a life—I kept thinking how little good could be said of me.

Wednesday I think the 4 September

I am just back from Long Barn, that is from Ashdown forest, where L. fetched me; & I have just eaten a pear warm from the sun with the juice running out of it, & I have thought of this device: to put

The Lonely Mind

separately in The Moths, as if it were a person. I don’t know—it seems possible. And these notes show that I am very happy.

I daresay it is the hottest day this year—the hottest September day these twenty years. So the papers may say tomorrow. Really it was too hot in the garden at Long Barn. The children were querulous—Nigel riding round in between the flower beds on his bicycle, & Ben stretched on the seat saying in a reasonable sad voice, Nigel you aren’t well—you dont look well. Boski says you dont. Mummy he ought to wash his feet. Vita (from the window) but he has washed his feet. Ben. Well they’re dirty again. Boski came in with the time table. The buses dont fit. They cant get back from Fairlawn before 8. Vita. Then ring up Mrs Cazalet & say they cant come. I must tell them they must put it off. She went to Harold’s room where they sat working with Mr O’Connor, & told them. Nigel began arguing. She was firm, & strode away. All this happened in blazing heat. The car was very hot. George brought a bottle of soda water. We lunched among some pine trees in Ashdown Forest, & lay full length afterwards, I with my straw hat over my face. Then L. met us, punctually at 4, at Duddimans (no—not that name) & we sat on some prickly holly leaves on the heath & talked to Vita about Harold’s letter. He says her poems aren’t worth publishing. She is very calm & modest, & seems not to mind much—a less touchy poet never was. But then can a real poet be an un-touchy poet?

She was very much as usual [?]; striding; silk stockings; shirt & skirt; opulent; easy; absent; talking spaciously & serenely to the Eton tutor, an admirable young man, with straight nose & white teeth who went to bed, or to his room, early, leaving us alone. I remarked the boys calling him Sir & bending with salaams over his hand & then kissing Vita—how English—how summery & how upper class—how pleasant—how without accent. This has been going on a thousand years I felt; at least, I can remember summers like this—white flannels & tennis, mothers, & tutors & English houses & dinner with moths getting in the candles & talk of tennis tournaments & ladies asking one to tea all my life—so pleasant, so without accent. And the tutor was the eternal tutor of young men—joking, affectionate, stern: watching Nigel with a sort of amusement & tenderness “There spoke the real Nigel” when N. said he hoped he had spilt the gravy on his trousers:—like a stream flowing deep & correct & unruffled through narrow banks. This kind of thing we now do to perfection. It is not interesting, but from its admirable completeness & sameness makes one tender towards it.

Nelly has been out this afternoon & picked, I think, 7 lbs of blackberries to make into jam. Please remember this as her way of thanking me for having Lottie—after all, she has no other. And one tends to forget it."
1929.09.16,"Leonard is having a picnic at Charleston & I am here—‘tired’. But why am I tired? Well I am never alone. This is the beginning of my complaint. I am not physically tired so much as psychologically. I have strained & wrung at journalism & proof correction; & underneath has been forming my Moths book. Yes, but it forms very slowly; & what I want is not to write it, but to think it for two or three weeks say—to get into the same current of thought & let that submerge everything, writing perhaps a few phrases here at my window in the morning. (And they’ve gone to some lovely place—Hurstmonceux perhaps, in this strange misty evening;—& yet when the time came to go, all I wanted was to walk off into the hills by myself. I am now feeling a little lonely & deserted & defrauded, inevitably). And every time I get into my current of thought I am jerked out of it. We have the Keynes’s: then Vita came; then Angelica & Eve; then we went to Worthing, then my head begins throbbing—so here I am, not writing—that does not matter, but not thinking, feeling or seeing—& seizing an afternoon alone as a treasure—Leonard appeared at the glass door at this moment; & they didn’t go to H⁠[urstmonceu]⁠x or anywhere; & Sprott was there & a miner, so I missed nothing—one’s first egotistical pleasure.

Really these premonitions of a book—states of soul in creating—are very queer & little apprehended.

Another reflection—nothing is so tiring as a change of atmosphere. I am more shattered & dissipated by an hour with Leonard’s mother than by 6 hours—no, 6 days, of Vita. (Nessa doesn’t count). The tremendous gear changing that has to take place grinds one’s machinery to bits. And I have done this constantly—& what is more than doing it, I’ve foreboded doing it—I’ve counted up the days & felt Worthing brooding over me. & then, psychologically again, having Nelly in the car is to me a strain—imposes another forced atmosphere. None of these things would matter much if one’s engine were going at full speed—how I tossed off every interruption when I was writing Orlando!—but it is as if they got in to the spokes—clogged the wheels—always just prevented me from getting the machine swinging round. And then I am 47: yes: & my infirmities will of course increase. To begin with my eyes. Last year, I think, I could read without spectacles; wd. pick up a paper & read it in a tube; gradually I found I needed spectacles in bed; & now I can’t read a line (unless held at a very odd angle) without them. My new spectacles are much stronger than the old, & when I take them off, I am blinded for a moment. What other infirmities? I can hear, I think, perfectly: I think I could walk as well as ever. But then will there not be the change of life? And may that not be a difficult & even dangerous time? Obviously one can get over it by facing it with common sense—that it is a natural process; that one can lie out here & read; that one’s faculties will be the same afterwards; that one has nothing to worry about in one sense—I’ve written some interesting books, can make money, can afford a holiday—Oh no; one has nothing to bother about; & these curious intervals in life—I’ve had many—are the most fruitful artistically—one becomes fertilised—think of my madness at Hogarth & all the little illnesses—that before I wrote To The Lighthouse for instance. Six weeks in bed now would make a masterpiece of Moths. But that wont be the name. Moths, I suddenly remember, dont fly by day. And there cant be a lighted candle. Altogether, the shape of the book wants considering—& with time I could do it.

Here I broke off."
1929.09.21,"Angelica goes to school for the first time today I think; & I daresay Nessa is crying to herself—one of the emotions I shall never know—a child, one’s last child—going to school, & so ending the 21 years of Nessa’s children—a great stretch of life; how much fuller than I can guess—imagine all the private scenes, the quarrels, the happinesses, the moments of excitement & change, as they grew up. And now, rather sublimely she ends her childhood years in a studio alone, going back, perhaps rather sadly to the life she would have liked best of all once, to be a painter on her own. So we have made out our lives, she & I, propelled into them by some queer force; for me, I always think of those curious long autumn walks with which we ended a summer holiday, talking of what we were going to do—‘autumn plans’ we called them. They always had reference to painting & writing & how to arrange social life & domestic life better. Often we thought about changing a room, so as to have somewhere to see our own friends. They were always connected with autumn, leaves falling, the country getting pale & wintry, our minds excited at the prospect of lights & streets & a new season of activity beginning—October the dawn of the year. But I am rambling off like an old woman into the past, when as I sat down, waiting for tea, I said to myself I have so many things to write in my diary.

Another of those curious plums, things falling unexpectedly in our way, has just happened. Annie the large eyed sad young woman has been to ask us to buy her a cottage, & let her do for us always, in fact be our servant here. She & her baby, aged two, have been turned out at a fortnights notice to make room for two spinster dog breeders. Humanity says we ought to buy her her cottage, & take no rent—let her work it off. Another £350, & repairs—more articles. She would make an ideal servant, I believe; she would be a great standby; one could come here as long as one liked—& poor dear Nelly could be left in London,—for she gave notice again this morning, to Leonard this time, about his coal scuttle. It seems we are settling & rooting almost daily. I should have to dismiss poor spindly Bartholomew. It needs some thinking—meanwhile Annie is up against this terrific high black prison wall of poverty—has to manage with a child on 15/- a week.

These reflections, which branch off down so many paths make me linger, over the two other records—Peter, & my future, which I thought I was going to write; but it is tea time, & then I want to wander off up the downs or along the river, straightening my ideas.

Please God nobody comes to tea. Yet Lytton & Antony Blunt & Peter are all at Charleston. Please God I say these delightful & divine people dont come & make me concentrate again all in my face & brain. I want to swim about in the dark green depths. By the way last night in the Evening Standard James Laver called me a great writer “nobody need seek to qualify the greatness of Miss Virginia Woolf”—hah! I hope Arnold Bennett sees that."
1929.09.22,"And it is ten minutes past ten in the morning, & I am not going to write a word. I have resolved to shut down my fiction for the present. My head aches too easily at the moment; I feel The Moths a prodigious weight which I can’t lift yet. And yet, so odd a thing is the mind, I am never easy, at this early hour, merely reading or writing letters. Those occupations seem too light & diffused. Hence, though write letters I will & must—to Dotty, to Gerald Brenan, to peevish Eddy, I will canter here a moment. It is a fine September morning; the rooks cawing, the shadows very long & shallow on the terrace. The body has gone out of the air. It is thinning itself for winter. It is becoming pale & pure like the eyes of an old man. An exacting & rather exhausting summer this has been. What with going to London, going to Worthing & having people here, I have never settled in; I feel I should like to stay on & avoid London for a time. The car makes us almost too movable. On the other hand, this is the best appointed summer we have ever had. Never has the garden been so lovely—all ablaze even now; dazzling one’s eyes with reds & pinks & purples & mauves: the carnations in great bunches, the roses lit like lamps. Often we go out after dinner to see these sights. And at last I like looking about the drawing room. I like my rug; my carpet; my painted beams. And for some odd reason I have found lovelier walks this year than ever—up into the downs behind Telscombe. Partly it is the weather, perhaps; we have had day after day of cloudless warm sun; the sky has been blue day after day; the sun has gone down clean, clear, leaving no feathers or battlements in the west. And lying out here I have seen the sun rise, & the moon shining one night like a slice of looking glass, with all the stars rippling & shining; & one night I had that curious feeling of being very young, travelling abroad, & seeing the leaves from a train window, in Italy—I cant get the feeling right now. All was adventure & excitement.

As for Peter, how right how charming how good he is!—but damn it all, what an uninteresting mind, intellectually. I cant put my finger on it, but nothing remains in one’s mind after seeing him, nothing interesting, no suggestion. Incessant similes, perpetual quotation; he sees life with great ardour through books. And then he is now all agog to copulate, which makes his stories centre round that fascinating subject too inevitably—copulation & King’s College Cambridge. He went through the war, & has had 4 years of battle & blood & wounds, & yet his mind keeps the virginal simplicity of a girls; he has the rigidity, at 36, of a crusted college character. I suppose the mixture is not very rich in him—thats all: father a schoolmaster, mother a housekeeper, life in the suburbs, scholarships &c: that was his upbringing; & then coming out of his shell, he deliberately vowed to be pagan, to be individual, to enjoy life, to explore his own sensations when there wasn’t much matter to go on. Hence the repetition, the egotism, the absence of depth or character; but I feel all this far more when he writes than in talk. In talk his charm & niceness, his integrity, his brightness, all make him a very nice, dear, delightful, memorable (yes, but not interesting) human being. He will marry; he will become Prof. of Engl. Lit. at Camb."
1929.09.25,"But what interests me is of course my oil stove. We found it here last night on coming back from Worthing. At this moment it is cooking my dinner in the glass dishes perfectly I hope, without smell, waste, or confusion: one turns handles, there is a thermometer. And so I see myself freer, more independent—& all one’s life is a struggle for freedom—able to come down here with a chop in a bag & live on my own. I go over the dishes I shall cook—the rich stews, the sauces. The adventurous strange dishes with dashes of wine in them. Of course Leonard puts a drag on, & I must be very cautious, like a child, not to make too much noise playing. Nelly goes on Friday & so I shall [have] a whole week to experiment in—to become free in.

Yesterday morning I made another start on The Moths, but that wont be its title. & several problems cry out at once to be solved. Who thinks it? And am I outside the thinker? One wants some device which is not a trick.

The greenhouse began to be built yesterday. We are watering the earth with money. Next week my room will begin to rise. It strikes me that one is absurd to expect good temper or magnanimity from servants, considering what crowded small rooms they live in, with their work all about them.

Then, old Mrs. Woolf—(I mean I am making a few notes, heaven knows why, but one always thinks there is a reason.) She has come to wear a charm & dignity to me, unknown before, now her old age is crumbling down all the cheerful sentimental small talk—she becomes curiously more humane & wise, as old women are; so pliable, so steeped in life that they seem to become philosophic, & more mistress of the art of living than much cleverer people. So many many things have happened before her; illnesses, births, quarrels, troubles—nothing much surprises her, or long upsets her. True she is peevish & bored as a child; but has attained some carelessness of show & pomp & respectability, as if she had washed her hands of most things & were playing on a beach, rather an enviable old age in many ways, though intolerable too. Always take opportunities I heard her murmuring to Pinka who had eaten all our soup. And then the long stories about her cooks, & how she had taught them cooking when she was rich. ‘Now you are poor & plain’ one of them wrote ‘after my great sorrow’ here she sighs, & would cry, but is easily diverted & presses a tin of toffee on me.

I must go into the kitchen to see my stove cooking ham now"
1929.10.02,"We have just been over Annie’s cottage—so I suppose it is. & we therefore own another fair sized house; but the arrangement with Annie seems another of those plums which since this time, or August, last year, have dropped into our hands here. She will cook; my oil stove makes hot meals practicable at all hours; but I am dazed with the Brighton conference; hearing Henderson orate & seeing him get red slowly like a lobster; we went on Monday too (how my days of reflection have dwindled! one must give it all up now) & heard a good, interesting, debate. The audience makes an extraordinary baaing noise; not talk, not footsteps—& I thought how politics was no longer an affair of great nobles & mystery & diplomacy, but of commonsense, issuing from ordinary men & women of business—not very exalted, but straight forward, like any other business affair.

The light is dying; I hear the village boys kicking footballs; & all those reflections, comments, that occur to me walking are died out—the atmosphere, winter, change, London’s imminence, scatter, finally, my poor efforts at solid concentration. Yet I have, these last days, set my book alight I think—got it going; but at a rate like that of Jacob’s Room Mrs Dalloway days—a page at most, & long sitting sucking my pen. And all the Americans write & cable for articles. And I shall go in & read Phedre, having picked some apples. Leonard in the cold windy road is cleaning the car."
1929.10.11,"And I snatch at the idea of writing here in order not to write Waves or Moths or whatever it is to be called. One thinks one has learnt to write quickly; & one hasn’t. And what is odd, I’m not writing with gusto or pleasure: because of the concentration. I am not reeling it off; but sticking it down. Also, never, in my life, did I attack such a vague yet elaborate design; whenever I make a mark I have to think of its relation to a dozen others. And though I could go on ahead easily enough, I am always stopping to consider the whole effect. In particular is there some radical fault in my scheme? I am not quite satisfied with this method of picking out things in the room & being reminded by them of other things. Yet I cant at the moment devise anything which keeps so close to the original design & admits of movement.

Hence, perhaps, these October days are to me a little strained & surrounded with silence. What I mean by this last word I dont quite know, since I have never stopped ‘seeing’ people—Nessa & Roger, the Jeffers’, Charles Buxton, & should have seen Lord David & am to see the Eliots—oh & there was Vita too. No; its not physical silence; its some inner loneliness—interesting to analyse if one could. To give an example—I was walking up Bedford Place is it—the straight street with all the boarding houses this afternoon, & I said to myself spontaneously, something like this. How I suffer, & no one knows how I suffer, walking up this street, engaged with my anguish, as I was after Thoby died—alone; fighting something alone. But then I had the devil to fight, & now nothing. And when I come indoors, it is all so silent—I am not carrying a great rush of wheels in my head—Yet I am writing—oh & we are very successful—& there is—what I most love—change ahead. Yes, that last evening at Rodmell when Leonard came down against his will to fetch me, the Keynes’s came over. And Maynard is giving up the Nation, & so is Hubert, & so no doubt shall we. And it is autumn; & the lights are going up; & Nessa is in Fitzroy Street—in a great misty room, with flaring gas & unsorted plates & glasses on the floor,—& the Press is booming—& this celebrity business is quite chronic—& I am richer than I have ever been—& bought a pair of earrings today—& for all this, there is vacancy & silence somewhere in the machine. On the whole, I do not much mind; because, what I like is to flash & dash from side to side, goaded on by what I call reality. If I never felt these extraordinarily pervasive strains—of unrest, or rest, or happiness, or discomfort—I should float down into acquiescence. Here is something to fight: & when I wake early I say to myself, Fight, fight. If I could catch the feeling, I would: the feeling of the singing of the real world, as one is driven by loneliness & silence from the habitable world; the sense that comes to me of being bound on an adventure; of being strangely free now, with money & so on, to do anything. I go to take theatre tickets (The Matriarch) & see a list of cheap excursions hanging there, & at once think that I will go to Stratford on Avon Mob fair tomorrow—why not?—or to Ireland, or to Edinburgh for a week end. I daresay I shant. But anything is possible. And this curious steed, life; is genuine—Does any of this convey what I want to say?—But I have not really laid hands on the emptiness after all.

Its odd, now I come to think of it—I miss Clive.

It occurs to me that Arthur Studd was another of the brilliant young men. But there was something innocent about him, compared with Bernard & Geoffrey: he spoke through his nose, & had a soft guttural voice; & a bald forehead, & rather handsome brown eyes, like a dogs: he was canine, in some ways; travelled, distinguished, rich; with a stout mother he disliked, & thus won my mother’s sympathy. He had thick red hands, but painted in the manner of Whistler—gesticulating over the canvas, & then producing some little pleasing melodious still life, with which, rather mystically, he was very pleased. It was ‘being an artist’ that took his fancy. He had lovely rooms in Cheyne Walk; & the white girls & pink clouds & rivers & fireworks of Whistler hung in them. He went to Samoa, to paint Whistlers perhaps, & came back when Stella was dead & grieved for her I think. He had loved her, in his fumbling ineffective way. Then he wrote little poems, about Eton, which he loved, & hoped to be buried there—But why should he think of being buried, with all his advantages? There was something ineffective about him—he could not do anything; but had, to us as children, a kind of romance; was supposed to do extravagant impossible things—like hiring a cab & taking us all off suddenly to play cricket at Lords—that I remember. I suppose he was the flower of Eton & the 90ties, getting itself varnished with art & Paris & studio life, & Chelsea. He sent me a post card from St Ives once, & a poem about Eton—& then—clap came the war; & being endlessly kind & generous & inefficient, no doubt he did great things for refugees, & died, without any notice being taken, that I am aware of—a rich bachelor; not much over 50 I suppose. Another ‘young man’—not brilliant exactly, but congenial in my memory, modest, fresh, unexpected, & always so nasal."
1929.10.13,"It comes to me to ask, how far could I live at this moment in Nessa being with Angelica at school? Can one supplement one’s life? I think a little. Julian has driven her over from Cambridge, this still soft grey morning. It is sunny & misty in the country. She got into the car in the King’s Parade, where the paper sellers are & the young men are hurrying I suppose along to breakfast. Then they drive, with a map on their knees; Julian rather tense, staring through his spectacles. Some very intimate things are hinted at—of wh. I know nothing—or rather he grunts & half says things, which she understands. She is very excited, at the same time practical. Julian is excited too. They are both very anxious to see Angelica. How will they see her first? She will come running down the stairs into the private room, on the left; with the Adams fireplace. And then? She will ‘fly into Nessa’s arms’. Nessa will hold her very tight to get the sensation of her child’s body again. Julian will call her “dear”. They will go out together into the park. Angelica will like to show off her knowledge of rules & ways & the best places to sit in; other girls will smile, & she will say ‘Thats Claudia’ or Annie. Thats Miss Colly—Thats Mrs Curtis. And all the time they will be feeling the comfort & excitement of being together—of having only just broached their time together. Nessa will get at ever so many things: questions of happiness, teaching, liking, loneliness—change. They will be very proud of each other & aloof. & Julian will peer about, through his glasses, liking Nessa & Angelica better than anybody I daresay; the simple crude boy—whom I shall now never know, I daresay. For—as I am going to say to Nessa on Wednesday—you are a jealous woman, & dont want me to know your sons, dont want to take, but always to give; are afraid of the givers. What will she answer?

But Leonard will go on moving the apples, & so I cannot write anything except my—what I am pleased to call—my diary. I wish I could write more succinctly, by the way, & with less use of the present participle. My carelessness shocks me. Nature is having her revenge, & is now making me write one word an hour."
1929.10.23,"As it is true—I write only for an hour—then sink back feeling I cannot keep my brain on that spin any more—then typewrite, & am done by 12—I will here sum up my impressions before publishing a Room of One’s own It is a little ominous that Morgan wont review it.* * He wrote yesterday 3rd Dec. & said he very much liked it It makes me suspect that there is a shrill feminine tone in it which my intimate friends will dislike. I forecast, then, that I shall get no criticism, except of the evasive jocular kind, from Lytton, Roger & Morgan; that the press will be kind & talk of its charm, & sprightiness; also I shall be attacked for a feminist & hinted at for a sapphist; Sibyl will ask me to luncheon; I shall get a good many letters from young women. I am afraid it will not be taken seriously. Mrs Woolf is so accomplished a writer that all she says makes easy reading … this very feminine logic … a book to be put in the hands of girls. I doubt that I mind very much. The Moths; but I think it is to be waves, is trudging along; & I have that to refer to, if I am damped by the other. It is a trifle, I shall say; so it is, but I wrote it with ardour & conviction.

We dined last night with the Webbs, & I had Eddy & Dottie to tea. As for these mature dinner parties one has some friendly easy talk with one man—Hugh Macmillan—about the Buchans & his own career;—the Webbs are friendly but can’t be influenced about Kenya: we sit in two lodging house rooms (the dining room had a brass bedstead behind a screen) eat hunks of red beef; & are offered whisky. It is the same enlightened, impersonal, perfectly aware of itself atmosphere. “My little boy shall have his toy”—but dont let that go any further “—that’s what my wife says about my being in the Cabinet”. No they have no illusions. And I compared them with L. & myself, & felt (I daresay for this reason) the pathos, the symbolical quality of the childless couple; standing for something, united.

As for ‘seeing’ Eddy & Dottie, there is not much to it; an occasional phrase one remembers—Eddy’s being in love with two people: Dotty’s rational account of a bore whom she helps: Eddy wishes me to read his diary, but some, nameless, friend objects; but he agreed, before long: it is a gratification to him. And so 1½ hours passed. Dotty deplored Vita’s too early fame. Yet I suppose she loves her; is devoted; queer things lodge in people’s souls;

I am very carefully & cautiously becoming a reader & a thinker again. Since I have been back I have read Virginia Water (a sweet white grape); God;—all founded, & teased & spun out upon one quite simple & usual psychological experience; but the man’s no poet & cant make one see; all his sentences are like steel lines on an engraving; I am reading Racine, have bought La Fontaine, & so intend to make my sidelong approach to French literature, circling & brooding—"
1929.11.02,"It takes precisely 10 days for anything to happen to a book—It is now Saturday 2nd. Nov: & the R. of ones O. has sold, I think 100 copies this morning; none before, or scarcely any, this largely due to Vita’s flamboyant broadcast. And I cant remember all the things I was intending to say,—like Renard—the man who kept a diary of the things that occur to one.

I dreamt last night that I had a disease of the heart that would kill me in 6 months. Leonard, after some persuasion, told me. My instincts were all such as I should have, in order, & some very strong: quite unexpected, I mean voluntary, as they are in dreams, & have thus an authenticity which makes an immense, & pervading impression. First, relief—well I’ve done with life anyhow (I was lying in bed) then horror; then desire to live; then fear of insanity; then (no this came earlier) regret about my writing, & leaving this book unfinished; then a luxurious dwelling upon my friends sorrow; then a sense of death & being done with at my age; then telling Leonard that he must marry again; seeing our life together; & facing the conviction of going, when other people went on living. Then I woke, coming to the top with all this hanging about me; & found I had sold a great many copies of my book; & was asked to lunch by Madame Kallas—the odd feeling of these two states of life & death mingling as I ate my breakfast feeling drowsy & heavy."
1929.11.05,"Oh but I have done quite well so far with R. of one’s Own: & it sells, I think; & I get unexpected letters. But I am more concerned with my Waves. I’ve just typed out my mornings work; & can’t feel altogether sure. There is something there (as I felt about Mrs Dalloway) but I can’t get at it, squarely; nothing like the speed & certainty of The Lighthouse: Orlando mere childs play. Is there some falsity, of method, somewhere? Something tricky?—so that the interesting things aren’t firmly based? I am in an odd state; feel a cleavage; here’s my interesting thing; & there’s no quite solid table on which to put it. It might come in a flash, on re-reading—some solvent. I am convinced that I am right to seek for a station whence I can set my people against time & the sea—but Lord, the difficulty of digging oneself in there, with conviction. Yesterday I had conviction; it has gone today. Yet I have written 66 pages in the past month.

Yesterday Sibyl came; & I told her that she was like a bird holding a stinking mouse in its claws—& the mouse was life. She admitted it. She said she had to go through an unpleasant business; was going to Paris this morning; would The unpleasant business was that she lost her nest egg—said to be £50,000, in America. Now gives tea parties only tell me of it afterwards. Then she bemoaned her lot, guardedly; how she had grown up so late, & only now began to see what it was she wanted. I gather that it is intimacy, simplicity, & friendship that she wants; & it is a little late in life to demand them; & how can she get them now, needing £20,000 a year too? So Arthur cant retire; they must sit there & see the season through; she cant, at the moment, master life; it is not a dead mouse after all; but wriggles. She looked ringeyed, puckered—I saw her in a flash, quite old. Her eyes were very tragic.

And today Stephen Tennant comes to tea. & Arthur Waley. On Sunday we were at Rodmell; & my room is now about three feet of brick, with the window frames in; rather an eyesore, for it cuts off the garage roof & the downs—both pleasanter sights than I had thought. They have driven a small hole through the little room, for the passage; so that by this time, no doubt, that is in being. & things fall & rise & disappear & re-appear. And most of my joy was turned to rage because I let Southease sale of furniture slip, & could have furnished my room perfectly for £20 I daresay. Such is one’s life—yes, such: (a convenient phrase;) And I am asked daily to lecture; & L.’s freedom draws near. Wright will inherit, & is making his dispositions. I keep saying “We shall be able to do that when you have left the Nation”. Still, you see what with oil stoves & Annie, battling my way to freedom. Jan. 1st is the day. We have had the Nation for nearly seven years, without making it blood & bone of ours, as once I thought possible. A tepid paper; neither this nor that, with the perpetual drag of Hubert & Harold, Hubert kindly incompetent, Harold competent but to me, all wood, red apple, sawdust, plausibility, respectability, hesitation & compromise."
1929.11.17,"A horrid date. Yes, I am feeling a little sick, a little shivery; I cant settle to anything; I am in a twitter; I try to read Mauron—to write—& my lips begin forming words; I begin muttering long conversations between myself & Vita about Dotty on the telephone; about Miss Matheson: I act parts: I find myself talking aloud; I say things over & over again like this “I want to know if after what happened the other morning you want to give me notice? … Well, then, as you wont answer, I am afraid I must now give you notice … But I want to explain exactly why it is. After you told me to leave your room I went to Mr Woolf & said that I could not keep you as my maid any longer. But I haven’t made up my mind in a hurry. I have been thinking about it since June. I tried to arrange not to order dinner so that we might avoid scenes. But the scenes at Rodmell were worse than ever. And now this is the last. I am afraid I can’t go on with it. This is the 17th of Nov. I shall expect you to go on the 17th Dec.” Yes, this is what I have to say to Nelly at 9.30 tomorrow, & then I go to Mrs Hunt’s [Domestic Agency], And I am almost trembling with this nervous anticipation as I write. But it must be done."
1929.11.18,"Well it is over, & much better than I expected—at least for the present. To my question Do you want to give me notice? she replied “I have given you notice—..” Further argument was attempted & cut short by me. “Then you wish to go at the end of your month—12th December.” “As we refused her an hours extra help when she was ill, yes.” But this was said without conviction. I clinched it by looking at the calendar (which I could not see, blind as I am) & then left her, in the calmest flattest way possible—which means I’m afraid that she has no more intention of going on Dec. 12th than I have of taking ship to Siberia. So be it. My mind is like a gum when an aching tooth has been drawn. I am having a holiday—reading old Birrell, & shall hope that the dust will be settled now for a week or two. The Horsham tiles are being put on my roof, so Percy writes this morning; which means that my rooms must be almost done. And now I have an extra room there—Nelly’s—yes; & no servant in the house here—thank God—two friends to come in one early t’other late; no more Bloomsbury gossip—no more Lottie barging in & out; no more fear of having people to lunch & tea & dinner; no more pains in the back, swollen ankles, & ups & downs of passion & effusion. And so, what with the oil stove, Annie, giving up the Nation, new rooms new servants, the new year will be one of the most interesting—a great advance towards freedom which is the ideal state of the soul. Yet it must not be thought that I have suffered acutely from servitude. My one claim on my own gratitude is that, directly I feel a chain, I throw it off: think of leaving Fitzroy; leaving Hogarth—leaving Hyde Park Gate I was going to say to round the sentence & indeed I think I have been an old struggler after my fashion—not so valiant I daresay as Nessa, but tenacious too & bold."
1929.11.25,"I merely add idly (ought I not to be correcting To the Lighthouse) that the difficulties with Nelly are to avoid an apology. She has weakened, & is now all out to catch us weakening. She wished L. many happy returns this morning. She came to me on Friday & asked me why I did not speak. I had some difficulty in being stiff & angry & saying that after her behaviour & accusations it was impossible. Mrs Hunt promises an abundance of permanent dailies, & so I think the die is cast. I have no doubt difficulties will begin, again; but not the old intolerable difficulties, no, no, never again.

I broadcast; & poured my rage hot as lava over Vita. She appeared innocent—I mean of telling H⁠[ilda] M⁠[atheson]. that I could easily cut my Brummell to bits. And then I discussed her friends, Vita’s friends, & said that here, in their secondrateness, was the beginning of my alienation. I cant have it said “Vita’s great friends—Dottie, Hilda & Virginia”. I detest the 2ndrate schoolgirl atmosphere. She sat silent for the most part, & only said I was right. Harold had said the same. The thing to do is to check it. She cant stop what she’s begun. And then in a hurry to Rodmell, where the roof is on, & the floor stretched with planks. The bedroom will be a lovely wonderful room what I’ve always hoped for."
1929.11.30,"I fill in this page, nefariously; at the end of a morning’s work. I have begun the second part of Waves—I dont know, I dont know. I feel that I am only accumulating notes for a book—whether I shall ever face the labour of writing it, God Knows. From some higher station I may be able to pull it together—at Rodmell, in my new room. Reading The Lighthouse does not make it easier to write; nor these impending final interviews with Nelly & new servants. We had a party—dining out at the Red Lion—last night; Julian & Rachel; Lyn, Hope, Plomer, Brian Howard, Nessa afterwards. Too many people, Leonard said. I dont know. I dislike B. Howard; I dislike his decadence, & protruding eyes, & unbuttoned waistcoat & floating tie. On the make, Leonard says. Plomer, on the other hand, was very plump & vigorous, fresh from the Bayswater murder; the details of which he said—how he had cleaned scraps of brain from the carpet apparently—could not be told. The young Jewess was attacked in bed at 4 last Sunday morning by a mad husband with a razor. First he locked the door, so that she banged & kicked, with the razor slashing her all the time in vain: at last burst out, with her head hanging by the skin to die on the landing. If William had not been away that week end the Chinese man would have come to him; & he thinks, killed him too. But this is not his line, he says as a novelist; & the psychic ladies who invest the house, like the coarser kind of bug & beetle, disgust him with their sea-ants. They table turn, & hear the voice of Mrs Frip—(not her name) from the other side; one, very fat with curled hair, said, “And it all happened a million years ago.” Disgusting, William said. His eyes—the representative part of him—flashed & goggled.

It is said that Hope has become a Roman Catholic on the sly. Certainly she has grown very fat—too fat for a woman in middle age who uses her brains, & so I suspect the rumour is true. She has sat herself down under the shade. It is strange to see beauty—she had something elegant & individual—go out, like a candle flame. Julian, for instance, could not see, I think, that Hope had ever been a young & attractive woman. She has some vigour of mind though. Lyn has less than I could wish. When she has written her review, there is not much left. And her ‘niceness’—housekeeping & nursing her sister who is ill—take the edge off. Had she £100, she would insure against illness, she said; because illness means that one cant work; this week, neither she nor her sister has made a penny. On that foundation it is hard to rear any very robust character; she is fretted & anxious.

Certainly it is true that if one writes a thing down one has done with it."
1929.11.30,"It is still Saturday the 30th November, & we have been to Greenwich, leaving Nessa & Duncan to paint Dottie’s tables in Mr James’ shed. Mr James is one of the Morris craftsmen; & has a tile making works near the river. He wears striped trousers & spats & will sit up all night, indulging himself with cups of tea, when the tiles are firing. Now & then you take out a tile to test it. He has three Kilns, the most expensive costing £300: & the Rotherhithe tunnel is near at hand. Leonard & I walked under the river (I thinking of the pressure of grey water round it; & of the absurd sublimity of errand boys & nursemaids walking on dry land under the river) & we came up in Greenwich & walked there on the parade where I walked a year or two ago in a temper. A man in a jersey was sitting in a glass shelter. How odd—to sit there, with nothing to do! And we saw the hospital, yellow & pink; & then it rained, & we went back & talked to Mr James about his tiles & then drove through the East End to the garage. I bought two crumpets for a penny; & we came home. Duncan began telling me the story of the London artists; & how Roger is so much hated by the critics that they wont notice the London artists. This is said to mean that Keith Baynes doesn’t sell. And so Nessa is having a tea party tomorrow to discuss the matter with Porter & Keith Baynes. For this she bought some cakes. And they are having Angus to dinner. So am I not thank God."
1929.12.08,"Dear me; last Monday, as L. advised, I asked Nelly if she wished to go: & so (as I foreboded) she said reasonably no; & proposed solutions; we were landed; not emotionally, rather weariedly, & disillusionedly on my part, in a compromise: to try Mansfield for a month,—(here is L. to ask about alterations—that is a 2nd E.C. & new lavatory basin which being settled—& its a roaring wind) we (then) if the trial is unsatisfactory then to part without further discussion for ever.

Just back from Rodmell. The roof is on; the floors are made; the windows in; giving, it seemed vast sweeping views of flooded meadows; but there was only a blink of light even at midday; we were engulfed in whirling wet; working up to such a storm on Friday night as I have, I think, never been in. It went round & round; & there was thunder in the crash of the wind; & great zigzags of lightning; & hail drumming on the iron roof outside my room; & such a fury of noise one could not sleep. So at one I went up to L. & looked at the lighted windows in the village; & thought, really with some fear, of being out alone that moment. Suppose the tree crashed, or the slates came off? We were not very securely sheltered, there under our slate roof; still better than being at sea. Dreams were all blown about, elongated, distorted, that night. A tree down in the churchyard. Trees down all the way up today. A curious sense of community brought by the storm. A man killed at Chailey sleeping in a shed; a woman at Eastbourne; a boy at Worthing. However, the mind was very still & happy. I read & read & finished I daresay 3 foot thick of MS read carefully too; much of it on the border, & so needing thought. Now, with this load despatched, I am free to begin reading Elizabethans—the little unknown writers, whom I, so ignorant am I, have never heard of, Puttenham, Webb, Harvey. This thought fills me with joy—no overstatement. To begin reading with a pen in my hand, discovering, pouncing, thinking of theories, when the ground is new, remains one of my great excitements. Oh but L. will sort apples, & the little noise upsets me; I cant think what I was going to say.

So I stopped writing, by which no great harm was done; & made out a list of Elizabethan poets.

And I have, with great happiness, refused to write Rhoda Broughton & Ouida for de la Mare. That vein, popular as it is, witness Jane & Geraldine, is soon worked out in me. I want to write criticism. Yes, & one might make out an obscure figure or two. It was the Elizabethan prose writers I loved first & most wildly, stirred by Hakluyt, which father lugged home for me—I think of it with some sentiment—father tramping over the Library with his little girl sitting at HPG in mind. He must have been 65; I 15 or 16, then; & why I dont know, but I became enraptured, though not exactly interested, but the sight of the large yellow page entranced me. I used to read it & dream of those obscure adventurers, & no doubt practised their style in my copy books. I was then writing a long picturesque essay upon the Christian religion, I think; called Religio Laici, I believe, proving that man has need of a God; but the God was described in process of change; & I also wrote a history of Women; & a history of my own family—all very longwinded & El⁠[izabe]⁠than in style."
1929.12.10,"A bad day yesterday, because I had Vita to lunch, which I hate, & lost one of my green leather gloves. We had tea with Leonard’s mother, who, sitting in a new room, fairly flabbergasted us by her accident. The hotel was struck by lightning on Friday; a chimney stack fell; her room was filled with soot & sparks—& there she was, dramatising it, shivering, shocked, yet buoyant & secretly pleased to be the centre of catastrophe again. As usual she had behaved with perfect calm—“but I feel these things so much afterwards” & was anxious to give pounds of tobacco to the workmen engaged in mending the roof. “What right, I said to myself, have we to sit here & see those poor fellows carrying bricks? Oh their lives—carrying bricks to the roof in this gale—& I sitting here” (in a pink hotel bedroom). This is her fluid imagination—pounds of tobacco, as Harold [Woolf] said, wdn’t do much to cure the social system.

It is I think a proof of the pressure at which we live that I have said nothing of our lawsuit—or have I? against the hotel, against the jazz band. Rachel, William Plomer & ourselves go to court on Friday. Why are the facts so intolerably dull? I shrink from writing them. I rather liked Scadding & Bodkin’s office; & swearing by almighty God; but Rachel & Wm. enjoy it more than I do. It is more unexpected. Rachel will tell her friends about it—as I should have done. But whole days knocked out of the week bore me. I feel that my greatest triumph is to achieve a quiet evening—in which to read El⁠[izabe]⁠thans. And Charlie Sanger is very ill—I figure him lying worn out, worn out & without much solid happiness to show for it; like some old gold link—so good, so genuine; affectionate; honourable; but a worn disappointed man I think: no natural happiness: a conscience; & then Dora."
1929.12.12,"Here, just back from Rodmell, & some rather forced conversation with Mr Philcox (the wife & I went to America—I dont like America—you pay separate for breakfast—room, double 24 dollars). I will rapidly note my evidence for tomorrow though Pritchard now says we shall be postponed—for the hotel cant get a witness. What I shall say—(I have the pump all right,) is this about the autumn.

We came back early in October & the music was very bad. My husband Case settled; expenses paid: 15th Jan. (about) wrote to the Secretary who wrote & assured him that everything wd. be done. Next night the music was so bad that my husband rang up the hotel; but they said they could do nothing. The music slightly improved, & we waited till the end of Nov. when it became so bad we were unable to sit in the room. The party was on 29th: on the 30th it was intolerable.

How easily facts escape me!"
1929.12.14,"No I am too tired to write; have been rushed, what with the lawsuit &c; have had toothache: & so sit passive, hoping that some drops will form in my mind. By the way, the sales of A Room are unprecedented—have beaten Orlando; feels like a line running through ones fingers; orders for 100 taken as coolly as 12’s used to be. We have sold, I think 5500; & our next years income is made.

Had I married Lytton I should never have written anything. So I thought at dinner the other night. He checks & inhibits in the most curious way. L. may be severe; but he stimulates. Anything is possible with him. Lytton was mild & damp, like a wet autumnal leaf. Lonely, & growing elderly; so he compares notes with Clive apparently. Our case stands over till next Thursday, & will probably be settled in the interval—some compromise made. Yesterday they screwed down some windows—the law had that instant effect. The law was sad-coloured, impressive. We saw Mr Preston at 10; he was in a black court coat, with dirty white bands; a self confident sandy, polite man. What a pugnacious chap you are! I heard another K.C. say to him in court. An admirable manly atmosphere—schoolboys come to responsibility they seemed; all so aquiline & definite under their frizzled grey wigs. Then the Judge (Farwell) came in. We rose. He bowed. He looked superhumanly sage, dignified, sad; the wig again cutting his forehead off & accentuating the deep reflective eyes—a sallow, sodden wearied face; so intent that he was monosyllabic—could not afford to open his mouth unnecessarily; merely nodded. All was over in 10 minutes I suppose. I felt the stress of it all; that man sitting there intent under his canopy in the small crowded court, never dropping a word, till 4 in the afternoon."
1929.12.15,"Tooth better, but not what I call a vigorous head; an idling, unconcentrated head—too much doing in Tavistock Sqre these last days. Last night we went to The Calendar (by Edgar Wallace) with Ann; & there was a cheer, & behold a great golden Queen bowing in a very small bow windowed box. Also, when the lights went up, the King, red, grumpy, fidgeting with his hands; well groomed, bluff; heavy looking, with one white flower in his buttonhole, resenting the need, perhaps, of sitting to be looked at between one of the acts—his duty to be done; & then not much liking the little remarks cast at him, to minimise his labour, by the Queen. Once the D⁠[uche]⁠ss of York sat with the Queen; a simple, chattering, sweethearted little roundfaced young woman in pink: but her wrist twinkling with diamonds, her dress held on the shoulder with diamonds. The Queen also like a lit up street with diamonds. An odd feeling came to me of the shop window decorated for the public: these our exhibits, our show pieces. Not very impressive—no romance or mystery—the very best goods. Yet he descends, I daresay, from Hengist; goes straight back, this heavy bluff grumpy looking man, to Elizabeth & the rest; will have his face forever in our history. He took spectacles out of a bright red case.

I thought (as I so often think things) of many comments to be written. One remains. If I were reading this diary, if it were a book that came my way, I think I should seize with greed upon the portrait of Nelly, & make a story—perhaps make the whole story revolve round that—it would amuse me. Her character—our efforts to be rid of her—our reconciliations."
1929.12.26,"Rodmell. Boxing day

And I am sitting in my new room—bedroom, not sitting room; with curtains fire table; & two great views; sometimes sun over the brooks & storm over the church. A violent Christmas; a brilliant serene Boxing day; & both very happy—completely, were it not for the damnable Byng-Stamper & his power to sell the down to a syndicate to exploit. That this is his intention comes through Percy; & I am wrought up to protest; indeed I must write to Ottoline & ask her the name of the little man who protects downs. This place is always being risked & saved; & so perhaps will be again. Cutting down trees & spoiling downs are my two great iniquities—what the Armenians were to Mrs Cole. I find it almost incredibly soothing—a fortnight alone—almost impossible to let oneself have it. Relentlessly we have crushed visitors—Morgan, Roger, Adrian. We will be alone this once, we say; & really, it seems possible. Then Annie is to me very sympathetic; my bread bakes well. All is rather rapt, simple, quick effective—except for my blundering on at The Waves. I write two pages of arrant nonsense, after straining; I write variations of every sentence; compromises; bad shots; possibilities; till my writing book is like a lunatic’s dream. Then I trust to some inspiration on re-reading; & pencil them into some sense. Still I am not satisfied. I think there is something lacking. I sacrifice nothing to seemliness. I press to my centre. I dont care if it all is scratched out. And there is something there. I incline now to try violent shots—at London—at talk—shouldering my way ruthlessly—& then, if nothing comes of it—anyhow I have examined the possibilities. But I wish I enjoyed it more. I dont have it in my head all day like The Lighthouse & Orlando.

Before I went Clive came to tea; sat alone for an hour or two. He asked me if I had been told that he had criticised A Room? I said no. He was a little rasped; said the jokes were lecture jokes. “Girls come round me”—too much of that—little ideas—nothing to compare with Orlando. And then, inconsistently, he praised O. above L⁠[ighthouse]. against what he said at the time. But his criticism is founded upon the theory that I cant feel sex: have the purple light cut off; & therefore must write Orlando’s not Lighthouses. I daresay there’s some truth—especially in his saying that my soliloquies, trains of thought, are better than my silhouettes. But, as always, his own axe wants grinding: that Love is enough—or if love fails, down one goes for ever. For we got on Mary of course; & again he protested that no one could have acted other than he did—& then he vaguely threatened an alliance, in France, with his loved—or the lady who loves. But does she love? Does she take him to Egypt? All trembles now on some unreality. Everything has been shifted by Mary; no fundament left. And I always feel, how jolly, how much hunting, & talking & carousing there is in you! How long we have known each other—& then Thoby’s form looms behind—that queer ghost. I think of death sometimes as the end of an excursion which I went on when he died. As if I should come in & say well, here you are. And yet I am not familiar with him now, perhaps. Those letters Clive read made him strange & external.

But a dog barks, & my lamp flickers—even in my perfect room. So down to Leonard, to read Elizabethans & put our glass dish on the fire."
1929.12.28,"Bernard Shaw said the other night at the Keynes’—& the Keynes’s have just wrecked my perfect fortnight of silence, have been over in their Rolls Royce—& L. made them stay, & is a little inclined to think me absurd for not wishing it—but then Clive is his bugbear at present—Bernard Shaw said to me, I have never written anything except poetry. A man has written a book showing how by altering a word or two a whole act of the D⁠[octo]⁠rs Dilemma is in rhythm. In fact my rhythm is so strong that when I had to copy a page of Wells the other day in the midst of my own writing my pen couldnt do it. I was wanting to write my own rhythm—yet I hadn’t known till then that I had so strong a rhythm. Heartbreak House is the best of my plays. I wrote it after staying with you at the Webbs in Sussex—perhaps you inspired it. And Lydia is making the Lady into Queen Victoria. No I never saw Stevenson—Mrs Stevenson thought I had a cold.

You write Irish Mr Shaw. So does Mr Moore. Moore’s an odd man—a very small talent cultivated with the utmost patience. We used to laugh at him in the old days. He was our butt. He was always telling us stories about himself & a lady—a grand lady—& she was always throwing something at his head & just missing it—& he used to say “Wait wait, there’s a good passage coming”. Nobody was better tempered. But he was our laughing stock. And one day Zola said to me I’ve discovered your great English novelist! Who’s that said I. His name is George Moore. And I burst out laughing not our little George Moore, with his stories about himself? But it was. A lesson, you see, not to be too quick in judging ones friends.

But all his stories are autobiographic, I said.

Yes, they are all about George Moore & the lady who throws something at his head.—is writing a life of Moore & has asked me to tell the story of his early days. I am collecting my works. I find that I wrote a million words about the theatre. I dont know what to do with it. My wife wants me to leave out. But I think it gives a curious picture of the time. I am ashamed to think that I could ever have written so badly. The collection is limited to 21 volumes. Theyre going to be sold in different bindings in America—some in leather very expensive—others quite cheap—hawked about all over America by peddlars. Im not a modest man but even I blushed at the stuff I’ve had to write for my publishers. Essential to every home & so on. I say out of twelve people, there will always be 3 women as clever as the men. What I’ve always told them is go for the governing bodies—dont mind about the vote. Insist upon representation. Now women are far more enthusiastic about business than men. They get things done. Men gossip in clubs. Oh but youve done more for us than anyone, Mr Shaw. My generation, & Francis Birrell’s (he was sitting behind) we might be nice people, but we’re different owing to you.

Happier said Francis.

Then Lydia came & broke in, with Mrs Shaw."
1930.01.04,"This is the new year, & I shall continue this book—from economy. I am having a holiday; it is fine; & so inveterate an habitual am I, I find it easier to walk after lunch than before. Far from doing nothing, I intend to write some letters, & have been pondering the early works of Miss Easedale.

The idea has come to us that we will live here from April onwards. And merely because of that idea, the view from my window looks different. It becomes usual⁠[?], something for a long unstressed time; hitherto I have always seen it as an interlude; a breathing space. I note, for that Portrait of Nelly that I should write, if I were editing these pages, that her letter to me began Dear Madam—which I hold to be as Carlyle used to say “Significant of much”. But these are notes merely; for some reason it bores me to enlarge.

Vita came yesterday with a green glass tank in which Japanese flowers expand in water. Here my mind would expand like that—the advent of the Keynes’ made it shrivel. And we wasted our fine day, that should have been spent at Rye, talking in their very ugly room. But I am not saying that they are ugly: that would be blasphemous. This perpetual denigration of human nature & adoration of solitude is suspect. Only, here I’m bound to the board, like an insect, for another three months; & my one fine day I grudge to society. Tonight we dine at Charleston & so home tomorrow to the pump, to the dance music; to Braithewaite, Goldie, Ottoline, Sprott & so on—to be ‘seen’ to ‘see’. A little music though—the opera—that I shall like. And now I must answer letters & so start London free from that anyhow."
1930.01.09,"I merely note that I am going to try to keep next week entirely free from ‘seeing’ people, bating my dinner at Bogy Harrises to meet the Prime Minister, & Angelica’s party. I am going to see if I can keep 7 days out of the clutch of the seers. I have arranged to do my seeing all this week, & have plodded along faithfully, & industriously: Braithewait & Miss Matthews, Dottie, Ottoline, Goldie, Sprot, Quentin, Miss Matheson & Plomer last night & Eddy to tea today, Vita tomorrow, Quentin on Saturday; & then nobody I swear on Sunday."
1930.01.12,"Sunday it is. And I have just exclaimed, And now I can think of nothing else. Thanks to my pertinacity & industry, I can now hardly stop making up The Waves. The sense of this came acutely about a week ago on beginning to write the Phantom party: now I feel that I can rush on, after 6 months hacking, & finish: but without the least certainty how its to achieve any form. Much will have to be discarded: what is essential is to write fast & not break the mood—no holiday, no interval if possible, till it is done. Then rest. Then re-write.

As for keeping a week free—I am now going to visit L.’s mother: then to the Frys after dinner. Marjorie Strachey to tea tomorrow: Duncan, I think, on Tuesday; Vita on Friday; Angelica on Saturday; Bogey Harris Wednesday: one day remains entire—Thursday—& thats the end of my week."
1930.01.16,"A page of real life. Last night at Bogey Harrises. I came in, flung into the room in my red coat. A very painted raddled tall, pink woman (Mrs Graham Murray [unidentified]); & the rest, in an oval room, with painted ceiling, & books—“given me by Horne with Ben Johnson’s autograph—the first edition of Dante—Lady Londonderry will be late; but we wont wait”. I have forgotten the prime minister—an unimpressive man; eyes disappointing; rather heavy; middle class; no son of the people; sunk; grumpy; self-important; wore a black waistcoat; had some mediocrity of personality. In came Lady L. very late; in ruby velvet, cut to the middle of the back, small, running, quick, current, energised. All went in to dinner, & I was too blind to read Sir Robert Vansittart on the man’s card, so had to jumble for my neighbours pursuit. Never mind. They all called each other Van, Bogey, Ramsay, Eadie, across the table; engaged in governing England: A mazer bowl fingered by Roger, drew Ramsay for two minutes, rather heavily into the open; took it; looked at it, laying his shabby drab spectacle case on the table; said he had never signed any authority for the sale of the mazer to America; then lapsed into tete à tête with the ladies—murmuring, unresonant. And so upstairs, Ly L. running ahead, opening doors, taking us into little rooms to look at Majolica, at altarpieces. Then round the fire she started off, fluent, agreeable, hard hitting, like a rider, or Captain, without an ounce of spare flesh, telling stories—old men who had operations & were then mad—left their money in a muddle—her own father mad for two years—Farquhar muddling up the Fife Settlements & the Liberal Party fund—all indiscreet, open, apparently; the chat of a perfectly equipped, un nonsensical, well fed, athletic woman, riding her horse at every fence. We discussed Birth Control. ‘Dear Edie, you wont let me convert you. But when you see your miners, with those terrible illegitimate children—

Eight in a room. One bed. What can you expect? They speak straight out to me, the old fashioned ones. Cant do anything else. What would you do? What should we do, if we lived like that? But we’re not beasts. We can control ourselves. I detest Prohibition for that reason.’

Swept on, energetically, confidently, to the Webbs (woman sprung up beside me like a cobra) “Our class & yours can never meet. What difference is there? But these clever people! Yeats & Lady Gregory on a committee are hopeless—but both very clever people. Cant do anything.”

Ly L. can do whatever she wishes. She looked like an early Victorian picture—a Lawrence, I thought; a small pinched well cut face; healthy; without paint; very pink, pearls knotted about her wrists. The other woman garish, like a ruined almond tree. The rooms all set out with cases, chests, pictures objects. “I never give more than £10: I hunt about in rag & bone shops.” Bogy has the glazed stuffed look of the well fed bachelor. Is evidently one of those elderly comfortable men of taste & leisure who make a profession of society; a perfectly instinctive snob. Knows everyone; lunches with Lord Lascelles; has taken the measure of it all exactly; nothing to say; proficient; surly; adept; an unattractive type, with all his talk of Lords & ladies, his belief in great houses; something of a gorged look, which connoisseurs have; as if he had always just swallowed a bargain. Something airless & too tidy in the house; a plethora of altar pieces. He pads about, gorged, without anything to seek for, save in old rag & bone shops; at the crest (I suppose) of his world. I suppose that this centre to one’s mind—an altarpiece—is a bad one; too still & capable of acquisition. He never wants anything unattainable, I daresay: & so has feathered his nest. Roger says he has ‘flair’; Roger who looks like a ravaged scavenger & lives with sardine tins & linoleum; yes, but Roger’s house seems alive, with a living hand in it, manipulated, stretched. Why do interesting people never fix them down among objects (beautiful) & Duchesses (desirable). I tried, sitting on a priceless settee, picked up in Whitechapel for £10 (I never give more) to analyse my sensations. The ladies showed a perfect commercial grasp of the situation. Ramsay was tossed between them like a fish among cormorants. I had the impression that they did not rate this acquisition high; but took it as part of the days work. Ly L. had him to herself in a shaded room for an hour. Failing this, she had her claims written down to hand him.

Angelica said at the pantomime, as we watched the spangled lady dance, “I shall never be able to dance like that but I may be able to paint like she dances.”"
1930.01.26,"I am 48: we have been at Rodmell—a wet, windy day again; but on my birthday we walked among the downs, like the folded wings of grey birds; & saw first one fox, very long with his brush stretched; then a second; which had been barking, for the sun was hot over us; it leapt lightly over a fence & entered the furze—a very rare sight. How many foxes are there in England? At night I read Lord Chaplin’s life. I cannot yet write naturally in my new room, because the table is not the right height, & I must stoop to warm my hands. Everything must be absolutely what I am used to.

I forgot to say that when we made up our 6 months accounts, we found I had made about £3,020 last year—the salary of a civil servant: a surprise to me, who was content with £200 for so many years. But I shall drop very heavily I think. The Waves wont sell more than 2,000 copies. I am stuck fast in that It has sold about 6,500 today, Oct. 30th 1931—after 3 weeks. But I will stop now I suppose. book—I mean, glued to it, like a fly on gummed paper. Sometimes I am out of touch; but go on; then again feel that I have at last, by violent measures—like breaking through gorse—set my hands on something central. Perhaps I can now say something quite straight out; & at length; & need not be always casting a line to make my book the right shape. But how to pull it together, how to compost it—press it into one—I do not know; nor can I guess the end—it might be a gigantic conversation. The interludes are very difficult, yet I think essential; so as to bridge & also give a background—the sea; insensitive nature—I dont know. But I think, when I feel this sudden directness, that it must be right: anyhow no other form of fiction suggests itself except as a repetition at the moment.

Lord Buckmaster sat next me. I was talking to Desmond about Irene. Suddenly Ethel said leaning across,

But did you ever know Lord Tennyson? & my evening was ruined. Typical of these parties."
1930.02.10,"Charlie Sanger died yesterday, the very fine cold day, when we were driving up. I feel sorry in gusts. I wish we had dined there. I shall miss some peculiar thing—loyal, worn, romantic; flowing with affection. He knew us when Thoby died; had always clasped my hand warmly, sat sparking, glittering, elfish; very sympathetic, very serious, in the right way. He had a stern view, I think; had found life hard; & envisaged its hardness for others. Yes; I have a peculiar feeling for him—can one say more? And this is the sorrow for him—feeling one will never again have that. (I cant analyse—have indeed a slight temperature, & am in two minds if it is influenza, & whether to tell Leonard, who has had it—to put off Ethel Smyth, & Nessa—to go to bed—what is the sensible thing to do?"
1930.02.16,"To lie on the sofa for a week. I am sitting up today, in the usual state of unequal animation. Below normal, with spasmodic desire to write, then to doze. It is a fine cold day & if my energy & sense of duty persist, I shall drive up to Hampstead. But I doubt that I can write to any purpose. A cloud swims in my head. One is too conscious of the body & jolted out of the rut of life to get back to fiction. Once or twice I have felt that odd whirr of wings in the head which comes when I am ill so often—last year for example, at this time I lay in bed constructing A Room of One’s Own (which sold 10,000 two days ago). If I could stay in bed another fortnight (but there is no chance of that) I believe I should see the whole of The Waves. Or of course I might go off on something different. As it is I half incline to insist upon a dash to Cassis; but perhaps this needs more determination than I possess; & we shall dwindle on here. Pinker is walking about the room looking for the bright patch—a sign of spring. I believe these illnesses are in my case—how shall I express it?—partly mystical. Something happens in my mind. It refuses to go on registering impressions. It shuts itself up. It becomes chrysalis. I lie quite torpid, often with acute physical pain—as last year; only discomfort this. Then suddenly something springs. Two nights ago, Vita was here; & when she went, I began to feel the quality of the evening—how it was spring coming: a silver light; mixing with the early lamps; the cabs all rushing through the streets; I had a tremendous sense of life beginning; mixed with that emotion, which is the essence of my feeling, but escapes description—(I keep on making up the Hampton Court scene in The Waves—Lord how I wonder if I shall pull this book off! It is a litter of fragments so far). Well, as I was saying, between these long pauses (for I am swimmy in the head, & write rather to stabilise myself than to make a correct statement), I felt the spring beginning, & Vita’s life so full & flush; & all the doors opening; & this is I believe the moth shaking its wings in me. I then begin to make up my story whatever it is; ideas rush in me; often though this is before I can control my mind or pen. It is no use trying to write at this stage. And I doubt if I can fill this white monster. I would like to lie down & sleep, but feel ashamed. Leonard brushed off his influenza in one day & went about his business feeling ill. Here am I still loafing, undressed, with Elly coming tomorrow. But as I was saying my mind works in idleness. To do nothing is often my most profitable way.

I am reading Byron: Maurois: which sends me to Childe Harold; makes me speculate. How odd a mixture: the weakest sentimental Mrs Hemans combined with trenchant bare vigour. How did they combine? And sometimes the descriptions in C.H. are “beautiful”; like a great poet.

There are the three elements in Byron:

1 The romantic dark haired lady singing drawing room melodies to the guitar.

“Tambourgi! Tambourgi! thy ’larum afar

Gives hope to the valiant, & promise of war;

* * *

Oh! who is more brave than a dark Suliote,

In his snowy camese & his shaggy Capote”



—something manufactured: a pose; silliness.

2 Then there is the vigorous rhetorical, like his prose, & good as prose.

Hereditary Bondsmen! Know ye not

Who would be free themselves must strike the blow?

By their right arms the conquest must be wrought?

Will Gaul or Muscovite redress ye? No! …



3 Then what rings to me truer, & is almost poetry.

Dear Nature is the kindest mother still!

Though always changing, in her aspect mild;

From her bare bosom let me take my fill,

Her never-weaned, though not her favoured child.



(all in Canto 11 of CH.)

* * *

To me by day or night she ever smiled,

Though I have marked her when none other hath,

And sought her more & more, & loved her best in wrath.



4 And then there is of course the pure satiric, as in the description of

5 a London Sunday; & finally (but this makes more than three) the inevitable half assumed half genuine tragic note, which comes as a refrain, about death & the loss of friends.

All thou could have of mine, stern Death! thou hast;

The parent, Friend, & now the more than Friend:

Ne’er yet for one thine arrows flew so fast,

And grief with grief continuing still to blend,

Hath snatched the little joy that life had yet to lend.



These I think make him up; & make much that is spurious, vapid, yet very changeable, & then rich & with greater range than the other poets, could he have got the whole into order. A novelist, he might have been. It is odd however to read in his letters his prose an apparently genuine feeling about Athens: & to compare it with the convention he adopted in verse. (There is some sneer about the Acropolis). But then the sneer may have been a pose too. The truth may be that if you are charged at such high voltage you cant fit any of the ordinary human feelings; must pose; must rhapsodise; don’t fit in. He wrote in the Inn Album that his age was 100. And this is true, measuring life by feeling."
1930.02.17,"And this temperature is up;

but it has now gone down; & now"
1930.02.20,"Feb. 20th, I must canter my wits if I can. Perhaps some character sketches.

Snow:

She came in wrapped in a dark fur coat; which being taken off, she appeared in nondescript grey stockinette & jay blue stripes. Her eyes too are jay blue, but have an anguished starved look, as of a cat that has climbed on to a chimney piece & looks down at a dog. Her face is pale, & very small; indeed, has a curious preserved innocency which makes it hard to think that she is 50. However, her neck is very loose skinned; & there are the dewlaps of middle age. The preserved look seems to indicate lack of experience; as if life had put her in a refrigerator. And we talked—She brought me a parcel, & this was a book from Ethel Smyth, with a letter, which to veil the embarrassment which I supposed her to feel, I read aloud. Her comment was “What miles away all this is from Cheltenham!” Then we talked—but it was her starved & anguished look that remains & the attitude of mind. She seemed to be saying inwardly “I have missed everything. There are Vanessa & Virginia, They have lives full of novels & husbands & exhibitions. I am fifty & it has all slipped by.” I gathered this from the jocose pertinacity with which she kept referring to herself. She said the climate of Cheltenham is so sleepy that she often cant paint; & after lunch they put on the gramophone; & then she goes most days to her mother at Bockhampton, where she likes meeting the village people. Farmers wives shake hands. After her mothers death—but she is only 80 & as firm as a rock—she & Lily who is political, but of course that doesn’t take up all her time exactly, are going to live at Harrogate, where the climate is not so sleepy, & they know more people. Nothing long distracted her from her central concern—I have had no life & life is over. Even clothes suggested the same old theme. A dressmaker had told her that one enjoyed life more if one was well dressed. So she was trying this specific, to the tune of £8.8 at Pomeroy’s in Old Burlington Street. But this worried & fretted her too. In fact I have seldom got a more dismal impression of suffering—too ignoble & petty to be called suffering: call it rather frustration, non-entity; being lifted on a shelf, & seeing things pass; “but then I am very lazy—thats what it is—I lapse into comfort.” I should call it lapsing into despair. “What can three women do alone in the country?” Lord, how I praise God that I had a bent strong enough to coerce every minute of my life since I was born! This fiddling & drifting & not impressing oneself upon anything—this always refraining & fingering & cutting things up into little jokes & facetiousness—thats whats so annihilating. Yet given little money, little looks, no special gift, but only enough to make her devastatingly aware that other people have more gift, so that she sees her still lives against the superior still lives of Margaret Gere & the Cotswold school,—what can one do? How could one battle? How could one leap on the back of life & wring its scruff? One would joke, bitterly; & become egotistical & anxious to explain & excuse; & plaintive. What I thought most pathetic was the fact that about 5.30 she began to fidget (she never does anything boldly & directly) with her gloves, & say she must be going. But where? I asked. To the Polytechnic to hear a lecture upon French literature. But why? “Oh one never hears French talked in Cheltenham.” Dear dear, but I could tell you all about French literature, I said. However, she shillied shallied; & whether she wanted to go or to stay, I don’t know. And when I asked her what she was going to do that night, Well that depends how long the lecture lasts, she said, feebly laughing. Wont you go to a play? No I think I shall have what is called a snack at the Temperance hotel;—Lord Lord, I repeat again. And it isn’t as if she were unconscious & oblivious: no, she knows that the dog is there, & arches her back & puts out her paw, but ever so feebly & fussily."
1930.02.21,"No two women could be more extravagantly contraposed than Marjorie Snowden & Ethel Smyth. I was lying here at four yesterday when I heard the bell ring then a brisk tramp up the stairs; & then behold a bluff, military old woman (older than I expected), bounced into the room, a little glazed flyaway & abrupt; in a three cornered hat & tailor made suit.

“Let me look at you”.

That over, Now I have brought a book & pencil. I want to ask.

Here there was a ring at the bell. I went to look over. Then we went to tea.

First I want to make out the genealogy of your mothers family. Old Pattle—have you a picture? No. Well now—the names of his daughters.

This lasted out tea. Afterwards, on the sofa, with Ethel stretching her legs out on Pinker’s basket, we talked ceaselessly till 7—when L. came in. We talked—she talked considerably more than I. (On the stairs going up to tea I had asked to be Virginia; about ten minutes after tea she asked to be Ethel: all was settled; the basis of an undying friendship made in 15 minutes:—how sensible; how rapid;) & she got off; oh about music—“I am said to be an egoist. I am a fighter. I feel for the underdog. I rang up Hugh Allen & suggested lunch. My dear Sir Hugh—my dear Ethel—there are facts you dont know about your sex. Believe me I have to go on coming to London, bullying, badgering—at last, they promise me 14 women in the orchestra. I go & find 2. So I begin ringing up.” She has a vein, like a large worm, in her temple which swells. Her cheeks redden. Her faded eyes flash. She has a broad rounded forehead. She recurred to dress. I have to go to Bath to hear dear Maurice Baring’s little plays; & then we go to (here Elly interrupted) Rottingdean. And I must take an evening suit. Thats what worries me. I’m only happy in this—I have one gown I wear for conducting. And then I have to pack (here is a pineapple from Leonard’s mother who waits outside). “My maid? But she’s only a general—an Irish woman. “Dr (she calls me Dr) Mrs Woolf doesn’t mean to see you. Heres another letter from her—to put you off.” But I’ve come. And dont it show that my appetite for life is still great? I’ve thought of nothing but seeing you for 10 days. And this friendship has come to me now.” So sincere & abrupt is she, & discriminating withal—judging Vita & her secondrate women Enid Bagnold friends shrewdly—that perhaps something gritty & not the usual expansive fluff, may come of it. I like to hear her talk of music. She has written a piece—on Brewster’s Prisoner; & will have the gorgeous fun of orchestrating it this summer. She says writing music is like writing novels. One thinks of the sea—naturally one gets a phrase for it. Orchestration is colouring. And one has to be very careful with one’s ‘technique’. Rhapsodises about A Room; about Miss Williamson; about the end of some book of Maurice Baring’s. “I’m in the street. I belong to the crowd. I say the crowd is right.” Perhaps she is right to belong to the crowd. There is something fine & tried & experienced about her besides the rant & the riot & the egotism—& I’m not sure that she is the egotist that people make out. She said she never had anybody to admire her, & therefore might write good music to the end. Has to live in the country because of her passion for games. Plays golf, rides a bicycle; was thrown hunting two years ago. Then fell on her arm & was in despair, because life wd. be over if she could not play games. ‘I am very strong’ which she proved by talking till 7.30; then eating a biscuit & drinking a glass of vermouth & going off to eat a supper of maccaroni when she got to Woking at 9.

“I’ll tell you all about it” she grinned at her maid, who asked if I was a nice woman. A fine old creature, certainly, Ethel. She talks French ‘meringues’ with a highly French accent."
1930.02.22,"I had meant to write a sketch of George—Sir George Duck-worth—as he announced himself to Nelly—& of Lytton; both unexpected visitors yesterday—for I’m not to go down to the studio till Monday; & so must canter my pen amateurishly here; but ten minutes ago the idea came to me of a possible broadsheet; which I wd. like to adumbrate, before discussing with L. My notion is a single sheet, containing say 2,000 or if printed back & front 4,000 words. Art, politics, Lit., music: an essay by a single writer to be printed at irregular intervals; sent to subscribers; costing 6d. Sometimes only a reproduction. It should be a statement about life: something somebody wants to say; not a regular comment. Very little expense wd. be involved. It would have a spring & an urgency about it wh. the regular sheets lack. Sometimes only a picture. To be closely under L. & my thumbs, And in June, I was offered the Editorship of a 4ly; by the Graphic Mr Bott & Mr Turner of the Book Club: L. is refusing it at this moment (30th June) so as to give character & uniformity. To lapse for a month if necessary. No incubus of regular appearance. A circular signed by L. & me to be sent round. Young writers enlisted. Signed articles. Everything of the humblest, least ostentatious. The Hogarth News. The Broadsheet.—name to be decided. You see I wd. like to write on Scott this week, & cant, because Richmond has sent the book already. L. wd. do politics. Roger art. The young would have their fling. Possibly, if expenses were kept down, they could get £5 or so, & have their names. But they must not be essays—always—must be topical to some extent.

That being enough to go upon in talk after lunch—& it is a fine still day & perhaps we may drive to Richmond & try my legs walking—I will obediently, like a student in the art school—sketch Sir George. First his jowl: it is of the finest semi-transparent flesh; so that one longs to slice it, as it rests, infinitely tender, upon his collar. Otherwise he is as tight as a drum. One expects his trousers to split as he sits down. This he does slowly & rises with difficulty. Still some sentiment begins to form misty between us. He speaks of ‘Mother’. I daresay finds in me some shadowy likeness—well—& then he is not now in a position to do me harm. His conventions amuse me. I suppose these family affections are somehow self-protection. He preserves a grain or two of what is me—my unknown past; my self; so that if George died, I should feel something of myself buried. He See Sir George Duckworth on ‘Pig’ in todays Times. Pigs are the most intelligent of animals. I own a small herd of white pedigree hogs.” is endlessly self-complacent. His stories, once started roll comfortably—he is immensely comfortable—into the pocket of his solid self esteem. I ask, What about the hogs (the Chesterfield hogs) & he replies that the cowman’s wife has had a very long labour. Margaret has been very worried. Dalingridge was lit up all night. They had to use the telephone—to send for the dr. The womans mother slept in the house—& so it goes on, singing cosily & contentedly the praises of the good master & mistress—which I have no doubt they are. And he trots out his little compliments—asked to be Sheriff. And he wishes to know if I am making fabulous sums—& he chuckles & dimples & respects me for being asked to a party by the Lord Mayor. And he twits Eddy Marsh for being fond of the society of the great. And he deplores the nudity of Nessa’s pictures—& so prattles & chortles & gives me turtle soup & advises about the preparation & so takes himself off, to meet Henry & return to Dalingridge & the cowman & the hogs—a very incestuous race—& his cook Janet & his Bronnie, home on leave from the Navy—well, it does appear as if human life were perfectly tolerable; his voltage is absolutely normal. The world has been made for him.

Lytton came in after dinner. Very twinkly, lustrous, easy & even warm. Leonard made cigarettes. I lay on the sofa in the twilight of cushions. Lytton had been sent a book about Columbus & told us the story making it into a fantastic amusing Lytton book—Columbus a mad religious fanatic who sailed west & west because he had read in Isaiah a prophesy; his crew being convicts let out from prison; & they came to Cuba & he made them sign a statement that this was India, because it was too large to be an island; & they picked up gold & gems & went back to Spain & the King & Queen rose as he came in. Here are all the elements of a Lytton concoction, told with great gusto; irony; a sense of the incongruous & dramatic. Then we warbled melodiously about Dadie, & Cambridge; & Charlie; & so on. He has a new gramophone. He is editing Greville. He is very content too—not for George’s reasons; & very well equipped, & buys books; & likes us; & is going to Cambridge this week end. Its odd how little one remembers what is actually said. I am thinking of the new paper."
1930.03.01,"And then I went for a walk & brought on a headache, & so lay down again till today, Saturday—a fine day—when we propose to drive off-oh Thank God a thousand To Hampstead Garden suburb [on 22 February] times—to Rodmell & there be at rest. This little affair has taken 3 weeks, & will land me in 4, of non-writing inexpressiveness. Yet I’m not sure that this is not the very thing for The Waves. It was dragging too much out of my head—If ever a book drained me, this one does. If I had wisdom, no doubt I should potter at Rodmell for a fortnight, not writing. I shall take a look at it one of these mornings in my sunny room.

One evening here I had the odd experience of perfect rest & satisfaction. All the bayonets that prod me sank. There I lay (I daresay for an hour) happy. And the quality was odd. Not an anxiety, not a stir, anywhere. No one coming. Nothing to do. All strain ceased. A [word illegible] supreme sailing with … through the dominion (I am quoting—I think Shelley—& it makes nonsense.) This is the rarest of all my moods. I cant recall another. Perhaps at Rodmell sometimes. Everything is shut off. It depends upon having been in the stir of London for some time. Not to have to get up & see Sibyl or Ethel or anybody—what a supreme relief! And now! have a chance to brew a little quiet thought. Yesterday I was offered £2,000 to write a life of Boswell by Doran Heinemann. L. is writing my polite refusal this moment. I have bought my freedom. A queer thought that I have actually paid for the power to go to Rodmell & only think of The Waves by refusing this offer. If I accepted I would buy houses, tables & go to Italy; not worth it. Yesterday we went over 57 Russell Sqre wh. we may take. But I rather dread the noise & the size—I dont know. A lovely view."
1930.03.03,"Rodmell again. My new bedroom again. Children playing in the school. A thick pearl grey blue day; water drops on the window. Suppose health were shown on a thermometer I have gone up 10 degrees since yesterday, when I lay, mumbling the bones of Dodo: if it had bones; now I sit up, but cannot face going down & bringing an MS to read. Curiosity begins to stir all the same. Such is the effect of 24 hours here, & one ramble for 30 minutes on the flats. The sun wells up, like a pulse, behind the clouds. Tremendous shoals of birds are flying,—& the flop eared trains meeting as usual under Cabum.

Molly Hamilton writes a d—d bad novel. She has the wits to construct a method of telling a story; & then heaps it with the dreariest, most confused litter of old clothes. When I stop to read a page attentively I am shocked by the dishabille of her English. It is like hearing cooks & scullions chattering; she scarcely articulates, dashes it off, I imagine, on blocks of paper, on her knee, at the House of Commons perhaps; or in the Tube. And the quality of the emotion is so thick & squab, the emotions of secondrate women painters, of spotted & pimpled young men: I dont know how she conveys such a sense of the secondrate without gift: the soft pedal too, & the highminded pedal; & no wit; & not precision; & no word standing alone, but each flopping on to the shoulder of another—Lord what a style! What a mind. It has energy & some ability—chiefly shown in the method; but that breaks down; & that too is laboriously lifted. Now being still flabby in the march of the mind, I must read Sea Air—a good manuscript."
1930.03.11,"all because I have to buy myself a dress this afternoon, & cant think what I want, I cannot read. I have written, fairly well—but it is a difficult book at Waves; but cant keep on after 12; & now shall write here, for 20 minutes.

My impressions of Margaret [Llewelyn Davies] & Lilian [Harris] at Monks House were of great lumps of grey coat; straggling wisps of hair; hats floppy & home made; thick woollen stockings; black shoes, many wraps, shabby handbags, & shapelessness, & shabbiness & dreariness & drabness unspeakable. A tragedy in its way. Margaret at any rate deserved better of life than this dishevelled & undistinguished end. They are in lodgings—as usual. Have, as usual, a wonderful Xtian Scientist landlady; are somehow rejected by active life; sit knitting perhaps & smoking cigarettes, in the parlour where they have their meals, where there is always left a dish of oranges & bananas. I doubt if they have enough to eat. They seemed to me flabby & bloodless, spread into rather toneless chunks of flesh; having lost any commerce with looking glasses. So we showed them the garden, gave them tea (& I dont think an iced cake had come Lilian’s way this 6 weeks) & then—oh the dismal sense of people stranded, wanting to be energised; drifting—all woollen & hairy. (It is odd how the visual impression dominates.) There is a jay blue spark in Margaret’s eye, now & then, But she had not been out of the lodging for 5 weeks because of the East wind. Her mind has softened & wrinkled, sitting indoors with the oranges & cigarettes. Lilian is almost stone deaf, & mumbles & crumbles, emerging clearly only once, to discuss politics. Something has blunted Margaret’s edge, rusted it, worn it, long before its time. Must old age be so shapeless? The only escape is to work the mind. I shall write a history of English literature, I think, in those days. And I shall walk. And I shall buy clothes, & keep my hair tidy, & make myself dine out. But perhaps life becomes repetitious, & one takes no trouble; is glad to be shovelled about in motor cars. M. has her tragic past. She is pathetic to me now—conciliatory & nervous where she used to be trenchant & severe. Janet she says writes endless notes; has sisters for ever staying with her to convalesce; & Emphie caught up their little white dog the other day from a wild herd of racing greyhounds, & had it bitten to death in her arms. This is the sort of adventure that only befalls elderly unmarried women, on whom it makes a tremendous & very painful impression—so defenceless are they, so unable to throw off the damp blanket that surrounds them. What I miss is colour, energy, any clear reflection of the moment. I see those thick stockings & grey hairy wraps everywhere."
1930.03.17,"The test of a book (to a writer) [is] if it makes a space in which, quite naturally, you can say what you want to say. As this morning I could say what Rhoda said. This proves that the book itself is alive: because it has not crushed the thing I wanted to say, but allowed me to slip it in, without any compression or alteration."
1930.03.28,"Yes, but this book is a very queer business. I had a day of intoxication when I said Children are nothing to this: when I sat surveying the whole book complete, & quarrelled with L. (about Ethel Smyth) & walked it off, felt the pressure of the form—the splendour & the greatness—as—perhaps, I have never felt them. But I shan’t race it off in intoxication. I keep pegging away; & find it the most complex, & difficult of all my books. How to end, save by a tremendous discussion, in which every life shall have its voice—a mosaic—a ——. I do not know. The difficulty is that it is all at high pressure. I have not yet mastered the speaking voice. Yet I think something is there; & I propose to go on pegging it down, arduously, & then re-write, reading much of it aloud, like poetry. It will bear expansion. It is compressed I think. It is—whatever I make of it—a large & potential theme—wh. Orlando was not perhaps. At any rate, I have taken my fence.

Home from tea with Nessa & Angelica. A fine spring day. I walked along Oxford St. The buses are strung on a chain. People fight & struggle. Knocking each other off the pavement. Old bareheaded men; a motor car accident; &c. To walk alone in London is the greatest rest."
1930.04.01,"And we have got to go & dine with Raymond now, this very potent, astonishingly exciting warm evening. I sit with my window open & hear the humming see a yellow window open in the hotel: I walked back from Leicester Square. What queer memories have got themselves mixed into this evening I asked. Something from a very soft, rather mystic evening; not feverish & fretful; no; by the sea; blue; gentle. And I dropped in at the dressmaker. She has no teeth. She was stitching. She said like a friend Mrs Woolf we are going to move. And I thought you wdnt mind if I left out the stitching as my eyes ached. All that is said tonight is gentle & happy & seems to thrust into some soft tide. I cant get it right, naturally.

Nessa is at Charleston. They will have the windows open; perhaps even sit by the pond. She will think This is what I have made by years of unknown work—my sons, my daughter. She will be perfectly content (as I suppose) Quentin fetching bottles; Clive immensely good tempered. They will think of London with dislike. Yet it is very exciting; I shall sip my wine at Raymond’s, & try & elicit something from Lytton. And so must change."
1930.04.04,"I am trying to sketch my last chapter—unsuccessfully; so will use 10 minutes to note my observations at Raymond’s. Chiefly upon the atmosphere of buggery. Lytton’s face lit up with love & rapture when I deserted the delightful women, with all their gifts, for Mr Williamson, brilliant & beautiful, but unknown, of Oxford. Raymond sat on the arm of Lytton’s chair. Morgan came in from Meleager. And I went to see Ronnie behind the scenes. He was looking very nice in shorts. Eddy came in from Cochran’s latest. He had had to stand & was (I am making up The Waves) peevish, (humour is what it lacks). Anyhow, he said, Ensor (I forget) looked very pretty in a white suit—the rest oh so hideous. At this the other buggers pricked their ears & became somehow silly. I mean rather giggly & coy. An atmosphere entirely secluded, intimate, & set on one object; all agreed upon the things they liked. Raymond barked once or twice rudely (he is underbred, in voice anyhow) his feeling that I was noting, scoffing. Told me how Gerbault loathed women; then protested that I was not to believe all the stories of D’Annunzio & Duse: there was another side; she had maltreated him. A protest; raucous, & obtrusive. A photograph of Stephen Tennant (Siegfried Sassoon goes to the same dressmaker) in a tunic, in an attitude was shown about; also little boys at a private school. Morgan became unfamiliar, discussing the beauties of Hilton Young’s stepson. “His skating is magnificent” (then in an undertone deploring some woman’s behaviour). This all made on me a tinkling, private, giggling, impression. As if I had gone in to a men’s urinal."
1930.04.09,"What I now think (about the Waves) is that I can give in a very few strokes the essentials of a person’s character. It should be done boldly, almost as caricature. I have yesterday entered what may be the last lap. Like every piece of the book it goes by fits & starts. I never get away with it; but am tugged back. I hope this makes for solidity; & must look to my sentences. The abandonment of Orlando & Lighthouse is much checked by the extreme difficulty of the form—as it was in Jacob’s Room. I think this is the furthest development so far; but of course it may miss fire somewhere. I think I have kept stoically to the original conception. What I fear is that the re-writing will have to be so drastic that I may entirely muddle it somehow. It is bound to be very imperfect. But I think it possible that I have got my statues against the sky."
1930.04.11,"Yesterday walked through the Waddesdon Greenhouses with Mr Johnson. There were single red lines taking root in sand. Cyclamen by the hundred gross. Azaleas massed like military bands. Carnations at different stages. Vines being picked thin by sedulous men. Nothing older than 40 years, but now ready made in perfection. A fig tree that had a thousand lean regular branches. The statues tied up, like dead horses, in sheets. The whole thing dead. Made, planted, put into position in the year 1880 or thereabouts. One flower wd. have given more pleasure than those dozens of grosses. And the heat, & the tidiness & the accuracy & the organisation. Mr Johnson like a nectarine, hard, red, ripe. He was taught all he knew by Miss Alice, & accepted admiration as his income. Sir he called us."
1930.04.13,"I read Shakespeare directly I have finished writing, when my mind is agape & red & hot. Then it is astonishing. I never yet knew how amazing his stretch & speed & word coining power is, until I felt it utterly outpace & outrace my own, seeming to start equal & then I see him draw ahead & do things I could not in my wildest tumult & utmost press of mind imagine. Even the less known & worser plays are written at a speed that is quicker than anybody else’s quickest; & the words drop so fast one can’t pick them up. Look at this, Upon a gather’d lily almost wither’d (that is a pure accident: I happen to light on it.) Evidently the pliancy of his mind was so complete that he could furbish out any train of thought; &, relaxing lets fall a shower of such unregarded flowers. Why then should anyone else attempt to write. This is not ‘writing’ at all. Indeed, I could say that Shre surpasses literature altogether, if I knew what I meant.

I meant to make this note of Waddesdon greenhouses. There were rows of hydrangeas, mostly a deep blue. Yes, said Mr Johnson, Lord Kitchener came here & asked how we blued them … I said you put things in the earth. He said he did too. But sometimes with all one’s care, they shot a bit pink. Miss Alice wouldn’t have that. If there was a trace of pink there, it wouldnt do. And he showed us a metallic petalled hydrangea. No that wouldnt do for Miss Alice. It struck me, what madness, & how easy to pin ones mind down to the blueness of hydrangeas, & to hypnotise Mr Johnson into thinking only of the blueness of hydrangeas. He used to go to her every evening, for she scarcely saw anyone, & they would talk for two hours about the plants & politics. How easy to go mad over the blueness of hydrangeas & think of nothing else."
1930.04.23,"This is a very important morning in the history of The Waves, because I think I have turned the corner & see the last lap straight ahead. I think I have got Bernard into the final stride. He will go straight on now, & then stand at the door; & then there will be a last picture of the waves. We are at Rodmell, & I daresay I shall stay on a day or two (if I dare) so as not to break the current & finish it. O Lord & then a rest; & then an article; & then back again to this hideous shaping & moulding. There may be some joys in it all the same."
1930.04.26,"Having had no letters for 3 days I feel my balloon shrink. All that semi-transparent globe wh. my fame attaches to me is pricked; & I am a mere stick. This is very wholesome; & grey; & not altogether displeasing though flat."
1930.04.27,"A queer adventure, to come back & find Lottie in the house (her great box under the kitchen table) having been dismissed by Karin for stealing. She was sent with a policeman to the station. She is to sleep here tonight. And I am to see Karin."
1930.04.29,"And I have just finished, with this very nib-full of ink, the last sentence of The Waves. I think I should record this for my own information. Yes, it was the greatest stretch of mind I ever knew; certainly the last pages; I dont think they flop as much as usual. And I think I have kept starkly & ascetically to the plan. So much I will say in self-congratulation. But I have never written a book so full of holes & patches; that will need re-building, yes, not only re-modelling. I suspect the structure is wrong. Never mind. I might have done something easy & fluent; & this is a reach after that vision I had, the unhappy summer—or three weeks—at Rodmell, after finishing The Lighthouse. (And that reminds me—I must hastily provide my mind with something else, or it will again become pecking & wretched,—something imaginative, if possible, & light; for I shall tire of Hazlitt & criticism after the first divine relief—. & I feel pleasantly aware of various adumbrations in the back of my head; a life of Duncan: no, something about canvases glowing in a studio: but that can wait.)

I must run upstairs & peep in & tell Leonard & ask about Lottie, who has been after a place; & by the way injured yesterdays lap I am afraid with her vicissitudes.

Pm. And, I think to myself as I walk down Southampton Row “And I have given you a new book.”"
1930.05.01,"And I have completely ruined my morning. Yes that is literally true. They sent a book from The Times, as if advised by Heaven of my liberty; & feeling my liberty wild upon me, I rushed to the cable & told Van Doren I would write on Scott. And now having read Scott, or the perky & impertinent editor whom Hugh provides to dish up tasty fragments, I wont & cant: & have got into a fret trying to read it, & writing to Richmond to say I cant; & have wasted the brilliant first of May which makes my skylight blue & gold; have only a rubbish heap in my head; cant read, & cant write, & cant think. The truth is, of course, I want to be back at The Waves. Yes that is the truth. Unlike all my other books in every way, it is unlike them in this, that I begin to re-write it, & conceive it again with ardour, directly I have done. I begin to see what I had in my mind; & want to begin cutting out masses of irrelevance, & clearing, sharpening & making the good phrases shine. One wave after another. No room. & so on. But then we are going touring Devon & Cornwall on Sunday which means a week off; & then I shall perhaps make my critical brain do a months work, for exercise. What could it be set to? Or a story?—no, not another story now. Perhaps Miss Burney’s half sister’s story,"
1930.05.18,"The thing is now to live with energy & mastery, desperately. To despatch each day high handedly. To make much shorter work of the day than one used. To feel each like a wave slapping up against one. So not to dawdle & dwindle, contemplating this & that. To do what ever comes along with decision; going to the Hawthornden prize giving rapidly & lightheartedly; to buy a coat; to Long Barn; to Angelica’s School; thrusting through the mornings work (Hazlitt now) then adventuring. And when one has cleared a way, then to go directly to a shop & buy a desk, a book case. No more regrets & indecisions. That is the right way to deal with life now that I am 48: & to make it more & more important & vivid as one grows old.

This is all very well; but what if Nelly then gets taken ill with her kidneys, must have an operation. Soberly & seriously a whole fortnight has been blown from my life; because I have had to hang about to see Elly, to buy food, to arrange with Taupin, to arrange with the hospital; to go there in an ambulance. My mind in order to work needs to be stretched tight & flat. It has been broken into shivers. With great plodding I have managed to write about the Women’s Guild. And I consider setting to work on The Waves. I have had over 6 weeks holiday from it. Only again, this morning is ruined because I sit waiting a char, who does not come. And we have Lyn & Sir R. Storrs to tea."
1930.06.15,"How many skips there are here! Nothing said of our tour through the West; nothing said of N.’s operation; of Taupin, who lost my key broke tumblers & cooked with the faded inspiration of one who had been a good cook; & nothing said of the divine relief of my quiet evenings, without servants; & how we dine out at the Cock; & how we say, can’t this last? & then how I rang up Mrs Walters; & that experiment, an arduous one, begins tomorrow. Leonard is not apt at a crisis. I mean his caution sticks his back up. He foresees obstacles. He has a philanthropic side too, which I distrust. Must be good to dependants. I am too hurried to spread these notes wider. At anyrate, Mrs W. an American who wishes to work, has been a journalist, is an intellectual, comes into our service tomorrow; being, as it were, Miss Ritchie, or Lyn Eirven. I have to give her orders; & she has to empty the slops. Will it work? will it last? Anyhow—every sentence begins anyhow—an interesting experience."
1930.06.16,"Mrs Walters is now here. And she says “What do you want with a Char?” But then new brooms &c. She is not new in one sense; rather old & lined; no, younger than I am; but a hard face, I think; but I forbear to crack her kernel. The interest will be to get a new light on housekeeping. My books are now my idol. Can I manage on less? How many pints? How many pounds of butter? Oh to be rid of servants—for all the emotions they breed—trust, suspicion, benevolence, gratitude, philanthropy, are necessarily bad.

And Nellie is now deposited on us for a day; turned out of hospital at a moments notice. I am amused to witness the conflict between L. & me. I hold a brief (hiddenly) for Walters; he (hiddenly) for Nelly. If the books are high, he secretly rejoices. If the food is good, I secretly denigrate Nelly’s cooking. It is odd how those old scenes rankle in my mind—how unwilling I am to have her back. Partly the silence is so grateful; & partly the absence of lower classes. I think with real shrinking of having her in control again. Yet she is obliging friendly affectionate; & I cannot bring myself to talk to her as I should. I am always seeing myself told to “leave my room”.

But enough—a useful phrase.

I dont know why, but I have stinted this book. The summer is in full swing. Its elements this year are Nessa & Duncan, Ethel Smyth, Vita & re-writing The Waves. We are very prosperous. On making up half yearly accounts, we find that we each get £425: & next year is sure, owing to the gigantic sale of The Edwardians—it verges on the 20,000. And it is not a very good book. Ethel Smyth drops in; dropped in yesterday for instance, when I was so methodically devoting my morning to finishing the last page of type setting: On Being Ill; I heard a ring, went up, & saw an old char in her white alpaca coat; sat her down; disburdened her of cardboard boxes; full of white pinks; & looked at her rather monumental old colonel’s face (girt round with an inappropriate necklace, for she was going to lunch with Beecham.) I get, generally, two letters daily. I daresay the old fires of Sapphism are blazing for the last time. In her heyday she must have been formidable—ruthless, tenacious, exacting, lightning quick, confident; with something of the directness & [single-?]⁠ness of genius, though they say she writes music like an old dryasdust German music master. Her style in writing memoirs though is to her credit—indeed she has ridden post haste through life; & accumulated an astonishing number of observations, with which she qualifies her conversation so as to drive L. almost frantic. One speech of hers lasted 20 minutes unbroken, he says, the other night. We were starting for a picnic at Ken Wood with Nessa & Duncan. Their sublime ineptitude made me laugh & made Ethel laugh & made Eddy peevish. There we sat in the garage, heaving, rotating, stinking. Then we stuck in Gower Street. The night drew on & the wind rose. A spot of rain descended. We heaved our way up to Hampstead. The house was cadaverous; the rhododendrons blanched. Where should we dine? Better go back to Fitzroy St—which we did, & dined off sandwiches & strawberries about 10 o’clock in the highest glee. She is a game old bird—an old age entirely superior in vitality to Margaret’s.
"
1930.07.06,"And to tell the truth in the 15 minutes that remain before I go up to Mrs Walter’s cold & exquisite but rather expensive lunch—to tell the truth I am slightly annoyed, both with Margaret & with Mr Birrell. Those were two kind acts of mine: the Women’s Guild article & the article on B. Neither has thanked me. M. sent a postcard. Yet I spent two or even 3 weeks on that Letter; & worked & worked. Never—this is the moral—do a kindness in writing. Never agree to use one’s art as an act of friendship. And therefore refuse to write about Maurice Baring, as he wishes.

We came into Ethel’s drawing room last Thursday & found a row standing against the window—the D⁠[uche]⁠ss of Sermoneta, M. Baring, & Joyce Wethered. Can I tell the story? I said to Maurice as we plodded after Joyce—Ethel running helter skelter after her great fuzzy dog—I said “This is like a party in literature—like Jane Austen’s box hill party.” There was a space & a formality & a definiteness about it that made it a real entertainment—with longueurs, with crises, with lapses, with culminations. We all had to wash. We all had to do this, to do that. Ethel’s home is better than I expected. She has more beauty & even comfort about than I expected from her alpaca coat. The red & pink roses were thick on the walls. The flowers were lush in the beds. All was glowing & bright. She has white rough cast walls; & no furniture that has cost more than a pound or two—much is old schoolroom furniture endeared to her by her intense egotistic imagination. “It was there I sat, when Mary played the piano … And I said Mary couldn’t you play G. sharp instead of G. natural … Thats the bed—Virginia you will have this room when you come to stay—where Sargent used to sleep, lying across: (because it is an old iron bed). And thats my father & mother—she was the artist…”

But I got the impression of a very genuine, breeze blown mind; a free, entirely energised character—no impediments no inhibitions—the freest talk with Maurice. “I met a nephew of yours Ethel, with two names”. “Well you might have—with two names”. No, I cant give the sense of her largeness, & space & ease & good breeding & character. She is, oddly, much more expert as a hostess than as a guest; doesn’t talk too much; is penetrating & quick, & has this delicious ease in summoning, conjuring up, people, like Lady Balfour & Mrs Lyttelton from the neighbourhood. They sat on the sofa while I, sipping champagne, talked fast & furious to Maurice B. who turned lobster colour & trembled, & chattered about his books. There were 5 people who used to help me: all are now dead. He has had his sorrows: I dont know what: loved ladies, I daresay."
1930.07.21,"And I went down again to Woking on Tuesday (this is written waiting for Vita, on a very wet cold afternoon. She is going to drive us round to look at a wardrobe. I am going to buy a gilt wardrobe I think. Well, it is very wet, & I am rather discomposed, with making 2 articles into one & so on. And I am not dining (here)"
1930.07.23,"Edith Sitwell has grown very fat, powders herself thickly, gilds her nails with silver paint, wears a turban & looks like an ivory elephant, like the Emperor Heliogabalus. I have never seen such a change. She is mature, majestical. She is monumental. Her fingers are crusted with white coral. She is altogether composed. A great many people were there—& she presided. But though thus composed, her eyes are sidelong & humorous. The old Empress remembers her Scallywag days. We all sat at her feet—cased in slender black slippers, the only remnants of her slipperiness & slenderness. Who was she like? Pope in a nightcap? No; the imperial majesty must be included. We hardly talked together, & I felt myself gone there rather mistakenly, had she not asked me very affectionately if she might come & see me alone. Her room was crowded with odds & ends of foreigners: the uncrowned King of Barcelona; Gerald’s partner; Osbert; Lady Lavery &c. Lady L. discussed the air crash. She said le Bon Dieu had taken them all at the right time. They had all done with life. Once too she would have been glad to die … This refers to the deaths of Lord Dufferin Lady Ednam &c. I was driving down to the Temple with Vita, & we bought a Standard in the gateway. ‘Titled victims’ she said. Well it cant be Harold I said. Then I read out Lady Ednam, Marquis Dusserre (for so they reported him) & then in the stop press Lord Dufferin—What Lady Ednam? Dufferin? she cried. There was Harold on the pavement before their house. “Yes, he said, Its Lady Ednam” “But its Freddy too” cried Vita (no she spoke composedly). God said Harold & read the stop press. Now what are we to do? I cant broadcast said Vita. I must tell my mother said Harold. First I’ll get the paper though. Good Lord—Yes its Dufferin & Lady Ednam. “Is that Lady Carnock. Darling I have some bad news for you. Have you seen the paper? Freddy’s been in a smash. He’s killed, they think. Could you tell Aunt Lai?” What did your mother say Harold? Just ‘Oh’. Now we cant dine with Lady Cunard. Oh yes dear we must. Perhaps I shall have to go down & see them—It was, as one says, like a scene in a play. The newspaper: the telephoning. The extreme simplicity & composure of it all: Boski typing; the man cleaning shoes; Harold telephoning, like a man in a play. So they drove off that wet grey evening to Lady Cunard’s: dinner at 9. 30 people; & I did not go. (& I hear the whole party waited for me for half an hour)"
1930.07.26,"Just back from a night at Long Barn, where I retrieved that fact about Emerald’s party, waiting half an hour, all in the sulks too for the smash of their best friends. And Lady E. & Mrs S. strewed Kent with £62,000 worth of jewels. Jewels in their hats, round their necks: somehow this makes me less sorry for them; undemocratic though I am. I rather like thinking of pearls pendant from oak trees.

I have 15—no 12—minutes before lunch; & am all of a quiver with home coming to L., to 2 newts in the bathroom, Letters (from Ethel, & flowers) books &c. A very nice homecoming; & I daresay a sample of my life, picked out of the mass (as it is, when one comes back) makes me a little amazed at my own happiness. I daresay few women are happier—not that I am consistently anything; but feel that I have had a good draught of human life, & find much champagne in it. It has not been dull—my marriage; not at all.

I liked rambling over Vita’s new fields, & talking to Mrs Page about the haycrop; & then champagne for dinner—an extravagance of Harold’s; sleep in the sitting room; a log fire; dogs; aeroplanes at night; dogs again; & breakfast in bed—mushroom & peach & hot bath, & so home, as I say, to the newts & Leonard. Clive will come to tea. Perhaps we may go to the play. And perhaps I might decide to have a new educated woman as servant. This comes on top of a day of Nelly Lottie & Mrs Mansfield. Their jokes their presence their familiarity, wh. rouse the usual reflections.

Passing the public House this Sunday afternoon, the buzz of voices through the door was exactly the same as at an evening party. My first thought was censorious: people in public houses. But this was soon corrected. I dont see much difference between the Marchmont Arms & Argyle [Argyll] House; or 3 Albert Road if it comes to that; except that we drink champagne & wear satin, & I sit between Lord Gage & Bernstorf."
1930.07.28,"A queer inconclusive but possibly fruitful conversation with Mrs Walter this morning. I think she would like to stay, if we could offer more wages. The truth is her husband has mistresses; or flirts. And she wishes to devote herself to us entirely—to do everything—that I should never have to order coffee. But she is going to think it out in August in Italy with Karl. I rather suspect (in my private mind) that we shall make a break here with Nelly, & take her—a great risk; rather fun: I feel 10 years younger instantly at the thought of a change. Anyhow, my constant relief at the absence of Nelly seems to prove that the system is as wrong as I’ve always said. Rooms empty of servants; to sit quietly; to have no jag [?], no unreal condescending talk. Other drawbacks suggest themselves—still anything for experiment—anything."
1930.08.06,"This is written at Rodmell; oh yes, & it is the best, the freest, the comfortablest summer we have ever had. Figure to yourself feet swollen in boots. One takes them off—that is my state without poor dear Nelly; with nice bright Annie. The rain pelts—look at it (as the people in The Waves are always saying) now. My dinner is cooking. I have so many rooms to sit in, I scarcely know which to choose. And new chairs. And comfort everywhere, & some beginnings of beauty. But it is the freedom from servants that is the groundwork & bedrock of all this expansion. After lunch we are alone till Breakfast. I say, as I walk the downs, never again never again. Cost what it may, I will never put my head into that noose again.

I walk; I read; I write, without terrors & constrictions. I make bread. I cook mushrooms. I wander in & out of the kitchen. I have a resource besides reading. Why we ever suffered that discomfort so long, that presence always grumbling, always anyhow (for thats unfair) at a different angle from ours, needing gramo [text ends]"
1930.08.20,"Last night was Quentin’s birthday. “Another Quentin birthday over” said Maynard, at the gate after the fireworks, counting perhaps the remaining years. The rockets went roaring up & scattered their gold grain. That is an old phrase; but I always think of grain when I see them. I can never find another. The willows were lit grey over the pond. The bonfire was forked, like branches in a wind. Nessa, in red, threw on a screen. Angelica, whirring & twirling like an old screaming witch, danced round it. “Childhood—true childhood” said Lydia. For some minutes everything that was said had the quality of sayings in a Tchekhov play.

I am writing while my potatoes boil. It has been a hot heavy ugly crusty⁠[?] day; still, sulphurous; & the dogs have barked all round the village, one starting another. And the men have hammered on the spire. And I have been driven out & in. I have slept here, over an article by Vernon Lee, sent me in Ethel’s daily letter. Ethel’s letters are daily: for we have so much to make up. Time is short. “I would like to see Italy before I die” she says in todays letter. Should I curtail her & curb them? I think not. If one adventures, adventure wholly. And she is so courageous, remarkable shrewd, that it would be mere poltroonery for me to hold off for fear of ridicule (still they hammer, at 6.45.) So I let that old bonfire rage red & perhaps throw a screen on it. It is a very happy free, & indeed to me occasionally sublime summer. Yes, I think I have decided against Nelly: but dont let me rub that sore. I think I am on the back of The Waves now. Then my walks. How lovely it was exploring yesterday to the Hump! How strange that in almost 20 years I have never been that way—out along the marsh road beyond Sutton house. I see a line I might make to Lewes. I fell in & twisted my ankle. I saw an astonishing assortment of cones & angles of grey & gold down, back against back. I was very happy. I like the still, the profound slow happiness best. One day I walked to Firle, in a shower & found a 4 bladed pocket knife.

The Waves is I think resolving itself (I am at page 100) into a series of dramatic soliloquies. The thing is to keep them running homogeneously in & out, in the rhythm of the waves. Can they be read consecutively? I know nothing about that. I think this is the greatest opportunity I have yet been able to give myself: therefore I suppose the most complete failure. Yet I respect myself for writing this book. Yes—even though it exhibits my congenital faults.

Janet Vaughan is engaged, & Gerald Brenan married.

Barbara [Bagenal] last night was aged, out of her element, peevish, & very red & beaky.

Julian silent. Clive undoubtedly on a fresh tack which does not allow of intimacy with me. I make these notes waiting in vain for that very interesting remark to occur wh. was on the tip of my tongue; & will not now emerge, though I bait & wait. If one writes little notes, suddenly one thinks of something profound. I am reading Dante, & I say, yes, this makes all writing unnecessary. This surpasses ‘writing’ as I say about Shre. I read the Inferno for half an hour at the end of my own page: & that is the place of honour; that is to put the page into the furnace—if I have a furnace. Now to mash the potatoes. & L. has laid my carpet."
1930.08.25,"Ethel came for a night on Friday, & in order to drown Percy’s mowing I will write here; for the friction of writing is a protection; & the dogs & the spire have been bad today. But they are bad because I am re-writing Hazlitt; having stopped The Waves at the break; & I am happy; & it is a very hot day; & we have been into Lewes, & I walked home part of the way. This is the only really hot day we have had. But I wish if I can to describe Ethel. At least let me pelt in a few notes of this curious unnatural friendship. I say unnatural because she is so old, & everything is incongruous. Her head is an enormous size over the temples. Music is there, she said, tapping her temples. That way lies insanity. What Walter said; what Wach (or someone) said—she cannot refrain from repeating what I guess to be very worn compliments, often repeated to herself at dead of night. For she cannot get over unfortunately her own ill-treatment. A refrain occurs; & it is all the more marked for being in contrast with the generosity, sense, balance, & shrewdness of all else. Off her own music, & the conspiracy against her—for the Press are determined to burke her, though she fills every hall—thats the line of it—she is an admirable guest. Oh yes & more. I went through some odd vicissitudes, in the way of emotion. Lying in my chair in the firelight she looked 18; she looked a young vigorous handsome woman. Suddenly this vanishes; then there is the old crag that has been beaten on by the waves: the humane battered face that makes one respect human nature: or rather feel that it is indomitable & persistent. Then, she is worldly; by which I mean something I like; unembarrassed, aired, sunned, acquainted with this way of life & that; lived in many societies; taken her own way in shirt & tie vigorously unimpeded; then I am conscious, I suppose, of the compliment she pays me. But then she is over 70. And (oh the dogs—oh Percy!—& I had marked off such a lovely evening—what am I to do?) She is sometimes startlingly quick. She has a lightning speed of perception which I liken to my own. But she is more robust; better grounded on fact than I am. She takes in a situation in one word. I told her about Margaret & my difficulties with the paper. No woman of 30 could have seen so swiftly or put the matter more succinctly in a nutshell, (her fault as a talker is diffusity). I had some interesting moments. About jealousy for instance. “D’you know Virginia, I dont like other women being fond of you.” “Then you must be in love with me Ethel”. “I have never loved anyone so much” (Is there something senile in this? I dont know). “Ever since I saw you I have thought of nothing else &c. I had not meant to tell you.” But I want affection. “You may take advantage of this”. No. Well, this, so far as I can boil it down, is Ethel’s state. But what I like in her is not I think her love for how difficult it is to make that intelligible—it is compact of so many things—she exaggerates—I am sensitive to exaggeration—what I like is the indomitable old crag; & a certain smile, very wide & benignant. But dear me I am not in love with Ethel. And oh yes—her experience."
1930.08.28,"It is the hottest day of the year: & so it was last year, almost on this day; & I was at Long Barn, & there was the Eton tutor, a nice young man with blue eyes white teeth & straight nose—& he now lies at the bottom of a crevasse in Switzerland—this very hot evening—lies crushed beside his Mary Irving: there are the two bodies for ever. I suppose some ice drips, or shifts: the light is blue, green; or wholly black; nothing stirs round them. Frozen, near together, in their tweeds & hobnail boots there they lie. And I am here; writing in my lodge, looking over the harvest fields.

I suppose they felt whirled, like hoops; battered; senseless, after the first horror of feeling out of control.

A very violent summer.

So I said to Janie Bussy Julian & Quentin on the terrace last Sunday.

The church was finished today & the scaffolding taken down. I am reading R. Lehmann, with some interest & admiration—she has a clear hard mind, beating up now & again to poetry; but I am as usual appalled by the machinery of fiction: its much work for little result. Yet I see no other outlet for her gifts. And these books dont matter—they flash a clear light here & there; but I suppose no more. But she has all the gifts (I suppose) that I lack; can give story & development & character & so on.

Annie offered me a paper weight of Strahn [? Strachan] in Scotland today in return for our paying her oculists bill."
1930.09.02,"I was walking down the path with Lydia. If this dont stop, I said, referring to the bitter taste in my mouth & the pressure like a wire cage of sound over my head, then I am ill: yes, very likely I am destroyed, diseased, dead. Damn it! Here I fell down—saying “How strange—flowers”. In scraps I felt & knew myself carried into the sitting room by Maynard, saw L. look very frightened; said I will go upstairs; the drumming of my heart, the pain, the effort got violent at the doorstep; overcame me; like gas; I was unconscious; then the wall & the picture returned to my eyes; I saw life again. Strange I said, & so lay, gradually recovering till 11 when I crept up to bed. Today, Tuesday, I am in the lodge & Ethel comes—valiant old woman!

But this brush with death was instructive & odd. Had I woken in the divine presence it wd. have been with fists clenched & fury on my lips. “I dont want to come here at all!” So I should have exclaimed. I wonder if this is the general state of people who die violently. If so figure the condition of Heaven after a battle.

I think one might write a fantasia called Reflections on the sight of a daddy long legs. There was one just now (I have moved in from the lodge, thus disturbing both L. & Annie) crawling over the handmade paper on wh. I have to sign my name 600 times. This bright sunny patch was his only pleasure. Yes, & then one dislikes daddies because they eat one’s plants. One has some kindness for their very few pleasures. What is one’s relation to insects?

It suddenly comes over me how I used to hook a piece of paper to me out of the nurse’s eye in other illnesses—what a tremendous desire to write I had.

I will use these last pages to sum up our circumstances. A map of the world.

Leaving out the subject of Nelly, which bores me, we are now much freer & richer than we have ever been. For years I never had a pound extra; a comfortable bed, or a chair that did not want stuffing. This morning Hammond [Lewes furnishers] delivered 4 perfectly comfortable arm chairs—& we think very little of it.

I seldom see Lytton; that is true. The reason is that we dont fit in, I imagine, to his parties nor he to ours; but that if we can meet in solitude, all goes as usual. Yet what do one’s friends mean to one, if one only sees them 8 times a year? Morgan I keep up with in our chronically spasmodic way. We are all very much aware of life, & seldom do anything we do not want to. My Bell family relations are young, fertile & intimate. Julian & Quentin change so much. This year Q. is shabby easy natural & gifted; last year he was foppish, finicky & affected. Julian is publishing with Chatto & Windus. As for Nessa & Duncan I am persuaded that nothing can be now destructive of that easy relationship, because it is based on Bohemianism. My bent that way increases—in spite of the prodigious fame (it has faded out since July 15 th: I am going through a phase of obscurity; I am not a writer: I am nothing: but I am quite content) I am more & more attracted by looseness, freedom, & eating one’s dinner off a table anywhere, having cooked it previously. This rhythm (I say I am writing The Waves to a rhythm not to a plot) is in harmony with the painters’. Ease & shabbiness & content therefore are all ensured. Adrian I never see. I keep constant with Maynard. I never see Saxon. I am slightly repelled by his lack of generosity; yet would like to write to him. Perhaps I will. George Duckworth, feeling the grave gape, wishes to lunch with Nessa; wishes to feel again the old sentimental emotions. After all, Nessa & I are his only women relations. A queer cawing of homing rooks this is. I daresay the delights of snobbishness somewhat fail in later life—& we have done—‘made good’—that is his expression.

My map of the world lacks rotundity. There is Vita. Yes—She was here the other day, after her Italian tour, with 2 boys; a dusty car, sandshoes & Florentine candlepieces, novels & so on tumbling about on the seats. I use my friends rather as giglamps: Theres another field I see: by your light. Over there’s a hill. I widen my landscape.

[Diary XX:]

September 8th 1930

Monks House

Rodmell"
1930.09.08,"I will signalise my return to life—that is writing—by beginning a new book, & it happens to be Thoby’s birthday, I remark. He would have been, I think, 50 today.

After coming out here I had the usual—oh how usual—headache; & lay, like a fibre of tired muscle on my bed in the sitting room, till yesterday. Now up again & on again; with one new picture in my mind; my defiance of death in the garden.

But the sentence with which this book was to open ran “Nobody has ever worked so hard as I do”—exclaimed in driving a paper fastener through the 14 pages of my Hazlitt just now. Time was when I dashed off these things all in the days work. Now, partly because I must do them for America & make arrangements far ahead, I spend I daresay a ridiculous amount of time, more of trouble on them. I began reading Hazlitt in January I think. And I am not sure that I have speared that little eel in the middle—that marrow—which is one’s object in criticism. A very difficult business no doubt to find it, in all these essays; so many; so short; & on all subjects. Never mind; it shall go today; & my appetite for criticism is, oddly, whettened. I have some gift that way, were it not for the grind & the screw & the torture—

Vita comes tomorrow; we go to Sissinghurst on Wednesday; I shall attack The Waves on Thursday. So this illness has meant two weeks break—but as I often think, seasons of silence, & brooding, & making up much more than one can use, are fertilising. I was raking my brain too hard.

Anyhow, this is the happiest summer since we had Monks House; the most satisfactory. We hope on Percy’s evidence—P. was tidying old Hawkesworth’s grave—that the Byng Stamper farm has been bought by a horsebreeder, & all the land is to be under grass—not bungalows. And Annie surprises one daily with her amenity, dexterity & sympathy—the most convincing argument in favour of living out that I know. Yesterday I sent an advertisement to Time & Tide—but hush! Profound secrecy is essential. The weather is September weather, bright, sunny, cool. We have a project of making my bedroom the sitting room—for the view. To let it waste, day after day, seems a crime: elderly eyes cannot waste. No, I would like to have another life, & live it in action. So I thought. looking at Caburn, & imagining the feelings of a strong young man, who was walking up it, with wife & children, & a career in the City … I think. No he was a politician; & I think he was also an Indian civil servant. He was not a writer: These are the stories one invents. And this: “At the age of 50 Priestley will be saying “Why don’t the highbrows admire me? It isn’t true that I only write for money.” He will be enormously rich; but there will be that thorn in his shoe—or so I hope. Yet I have not read, & I daresay shall never read, a book by Priestley. And I (to solace myself) get a letter from a Mr Spender saying he cares for my praise more than for that of any critic—& he sends me his poems. And I invent this phrase for Bennett & Priestley “the tradesmen of letters”."
1930.09.24,"I have taken up my staff again; I wish I could say that my book was my staff; but oh dear, how many people I have seen—dashing that support from my hand! It must have been the afternoon I wrote this—yes, because L. & Percy were in the middle of moving the furniture into the sitting room—that Mary & Barbara [Hutchinson]’s little medicine bottle heads appeared at the window. How I scowled! And then there was Alice Ritchie, then the Wolves, then Morgan, then a party at Charleston then London, & then those curious women, Miss Ibbotson & Mrs Starr.

“I am a cousin of Florence Nightingale” said Mrs Starr. When I said I was also related, her rather shifty eyes became shiftier. “I cant make omelettes” said Miss Ibbotson, addressing herself plaintively & at the same time peevishly to Mrs Starr. “It would be a great disaster of course if you sent in your dishes all burnt” said Mrs Starr. “You would give me notice, I suppose” said Miss Ibbotson. Miss Ibbotson was bankrupt; “Beggars can’t be choosers” she said, “& so thats why I’m back again at this’. Miss Ibbotson had once owned two motor cars & driven them for hire in London, but competition with the men had been too much. She had also been ill. She was skinny, raddled; wore a small corduroy jacket, & a rather dirty white shirt; had a red pocket-handkerchief; thick mended stockings & thick shoes. Mrs Starr was dressed in blue Liberty silk & a straw hat. She reproved Miss I. for being too diffident. “If I could have a trial” Miss I. repeated. But you will soon pick it up” said Mrs S. “I cant do fancy cooking” said Miss I. “And I would like to do some of the cleaning.” “I shall do the cleaning” said Mrs S. “& you will do the kitchen.” These remarks were shot at each other, & plainly represented much previous argument, though why Mrs S., so compact, if sly, had come into touch with Miss I., so wild, with her staring blue eyes & her wideawake, I could not say. An indefinable aroma of sordidity, instability, shadiness, shiftiness pervaded them. They were sure, I think almost at once, that we had seen through them, & that the place was not for them. “We live on Salads” said Mrs S. “though I am not a vegetarian.” Sure enough the brown holland bag which they left behind them contained a number of lettuces wrapped in paper.

Miss Rivett-Carnac is the scion of a great Indian family who let her live in Wimbledon with her mother on a pound a week. She has been through a good deal: social work; hostels; running clubs. She is about 35; a perfect lady, enough to be careless of being one; only anxious for shelter, & wages, & a little time to herself. She might do—she might be a superior Walter. She has, oh dear, suffered much. And is perhaps, vengeful, acid, worn, trusty, starved of happiness.

Could anything be done to make us less popular? we ask. For instance if I pied Leonard’s hair—would that make his mother, Bella, Tom [Southorn], Harold [Woolf], Dorothy Bussy, Ellie Rendel & Ka Cox refuse to invite themselves to see us?

When I offered Miss Rivett-Carnac £50 yesterday it seemed to me nothing, because I was thinking that I can make that by writing 2,000 words. But 5 years ago, £50 was a substantial sum. How money has shrunk in my mind! This is one of the most curious things in my existence—the shrinkage of money.

A perfect September day, after some very imperfect November days; the swallows skimming the terrace; Percy asking if it will be fine tomorrow; if so, he will mow the lawn. The bees are suspected to have been busy. In that case we shall take honey tonight. L. & P. spent the afternoon—Trim & Uncle Toby—mending the fence; I spent it walking the downs. I still have in spite of building a perfect stretch, & by juggling a little, can convert distant houses into haystacks.

I am reading Dante; & my present view of reading is to elongate immensely. I take a week over one canto. No hurry.

Our friends work us very hard. Heres Tom Eliot: when are you back? Here’s Miss Bartlett [unidentified], may we come to tea. Heres—& my two months’ respite nibbled at by all who choose. I think I will spend August next year in Northumberland."
1930.09.29,"So all those days were completely ruined by the assiduity of our friends. When one has to tidy the table, pick fresh flowers, collect chairs & be ready, at 4, or at one, to welcome, & all the rest of it the circumjacent parts of the day are ruined. On the whole L.’s family do the trick most thoroughly. Everything is such an effort; so unreal; what I say is so remote from what I feel; their standards are so different from mine; I strain myself perpetually with trying to provide the right cakes, the right jokes, the right affection & inquiries. Naturally it often goes wrong, as on Friday. Harold, who is to me the most sympathetic of them, told a story of the Woolf temper; how Philip had broken down the servants bedroom door in a rage, because they had put a bottle, unfastened, into Bab’s bed, & refused to come & make it. Mrs W. who is the vainest of women (poor old lady—yes, ones feeling of poor old woman churns⁠[?] & muddles all one’s feelings of her egotism, her vanity) took this as a slur upon herself; & began querulously & peevishly to defend her methods of education, & to pay herself the usual compliments upon her wonderful management of so many fatherless & penniless children. And then of course she requires to have these praises corroborated, & will not be satisfied until I have also wondered & exclaimed at her amazing unselfishness & courage & agreed that the Woolf temper is merely a proof of their intelligence. Here of course, I begin to see very plainly how ugly, how nosey, how irreparably middle class they all are. Indeed, my aesthetic sense is the one that protests most obstinately—how they cheapen the house & garden—How they bring in an atmosphere of Earls Court & hotels, how impossibly out of place, & stuffy & towny & dressy & dowdy they look on the terrace, among apple trees & vegetables & flowers! But there I am pinned down, as firmly as Prometheus on his rock, to have my day, Friday 26th of September 1930, picked to pieces, & made cheap & ugly & commonplace; for the sting of it is that there is no possible escape—no escape that wont make old Mrs Woolf begin to dab her eyes & feel that she is not being welcomed—she who is so “painfully sensitive”—so fond of cakes, so incapable of amusing herself, so entirely without any interest in my feelings or friends; so vampire like & vast in her demand for my entire attention & sympathy, while she sits over the fire, in her dreary furs & ugly bonnet & large boots, with her pendulous cheeks & red nose & cheap earrings, talking about Worthing & the charms of Dr Watson & the niceness of everybody, & how she will come to Worthing every year, & will expect to come to tea with us. Lord Lord! how many daughters have been murdered by women like this! What a net of falsity they spread over life. How it rots beneath their sweetness—goes brown & soft like a bad pear!

At the same time I cannot make out a case for myself as a maltreated person. No, because I have an interest beyond my own nose. But let me note that old age can only be made tolerable by having a firm anchor outside gossip, cakes, & sympathy. Think of imposing even one afternoon of such a burden upon Quentin Julian & Angelica! I shall spend my day at the British Museum. (This is one of those visual images, without meaning when written down, that conveys a whole state of mind to me)

Rodmell is full of incident, drama, &, sometimes I think, coming home over the flats, of beauty & solemnity. Mr Fears the epileptic died on Thursday. He had been locked in his room for weeks; but escaped, made off to Southease, & called on the Thomases to present his grievance to the Rector. One of his grievances was that Mrs Dedman had stolen part of his garden—& it is said—& I can believe it—that this was no figment. There she stands in the street, ominous, glum, predatory, grasping, complaining. Then a doctor taps at the window: someone has been taken ill in the street & carried into a cottage. It was the mother of Miss Emery the dog breeder. She now lies dying perhaps, & her husband must be taken for a motor drive while they are burying Mr Fears to distract him from the thought of death. It is the most miserable of days, cold & drizzling, the leaves falling; the apples fallen; the flowers sodden; mist hiding Caburn. Yet I have written well, & cannot make out a case for myself as a maltreated person.

The great game of diplomacy is begun with Nelly. I have told Dr McGlashan that we will pay her wages, but not have her back till she is well."
1930.10.11,"The fifty coffins have just trundled by, in lorries, spread rather skimpily with Union Jacks—an unbecoming pall—& stuck about with red & yellow wreaths. The only impressive sight was the rhythmical bending backward slow march of the Guards: for the rest, the human face is often pock marked & ignoble; poor gunners [?] look bored & twitch their noses; the crowd smells; the sun makes it all too like birthday cakes & crackers; & the coffins conceal too much. One bone, one charred hand, wd. have done what no ceremony can do: & the heap of a ceremony on ones little coal of feeling presses uneasily. I refer to the burial this morning of the 48 ‘heroes’ of the R101. But why ‘heroes’? A shifty & unpleasant man, Lord Thomson by all accounts, goes for a joy ride with other notables, & has the misfortune to be burnt at Beauvais. That being so, we have every reason to say Good God how very painful—how very unlucky—but why all the shops in Oxford St & Southampton Row shd. display black dresses only & run up black bars; why the Nation should be requested to think of nothing else; why the people should line the streets & parade through Westminster Hall, why every paper should be filled with nobility & lamentation & praise, why the Germans should muffle their wireless & the French ordain a day of mourning & the footballers stop for two minutes’ silence—beats me & Leonard & Miss Strachan."
1930.10.15,"I say to myself “But I cannot write another word”. I say “I will cut adrift—I will go to Roger in France—I will sit on pavements & drink coffee—I will see the Southern hills; I will dream; I will take my mind out of its iron cage & let it swim—this fine October”. I say all this; with energy: but shall I do it? Shant I peter out here, till the fountain fills again? Oh dear oh dear—for the lassitude of the spirit! Rarely rarely comest thou now, spirit of delight. You hide yourself up there behind the hotel windows & the grey clouds. (I am writing this with a steel pen which I dip in the ink, so as to forestall the day when my German pens are extinct). It is dismal to broach October so languidly. I rather think the same thing happened last year. I need solitude. I need space. I need air. I need the empty fields round me; & my legs pounding along roads; & sleep; & animal existence. My brain is too energetic; it works; it throws off an article on Christina Rossetti; & girds itself up to deal with this & that.

Rivett is installed. And she cooks like a freehanded lady. Light sketchy dishes arrive. This is only our second day, & Annie, infinitely happy garrulous & anxious to stay—how can I put up with Rodmell now, she says. I shall feel shut up inside something—Annie goes today. A curious little interlude this. Alas, one day last week Nelly appeared—of course on her best behaviour—very much the old & trusted servant, with, I think, a dash of suspicion. Why did I not have her back & give her help, seeing that she had been with us 15 years?—that I think was in her mind. But we kept it down; & she is off to Colchester for 10 days & then—oh dear, I say again, oh dear. Nessa & Duncan are at Cassis, which brings the delicious vision of France too near me—Oh to walk among vineyards I cry again. And lots of people are on the buzz: dined last night with Raymond, a shabby & diminished Raymond, whom I like better than the dashing. Not much wine & so on. He has given up parties & takes Wyndham Lewis much to heart “A middle aged man-milliner” said Lewis in that pamphlet which is like the gossip & spite & bickering of a suburban housemaid who has been given notice & is getting a bit of her own back."
1930.10.18,"But behold, I think the spirit of delight is hovering over me, after 2 days at Rodmell, in spite of Ethel Smyth, in spite of Emmie Fisher. Two teasing & tormenting letters from them were, of course, forwarded. But we walked to Lewes over the fields—yes, reached our goal, came out under that tunnel; now I have planned this walk for almost 20 years & never taken it. Home now, & find another letter, shaken & remorseful from Ethel, & Tom’s new edition of Johnson, & ever so many flowers."
1930.10.22,"Just back from headache cheating—there should be a name for these peregrinations—at Hampton Court, My misery at the sere & yellow leaves, & the ships coming in & I not there & I not there—drove me to take a day off; indeed to plan 2 days off; but no: it rains now; & I’m for the fire.

My misery is Leonard’s. Rivett cant cook. Poor woman! Bowed down with a sense of the failure of her life, creeping broken winged, arid, deprecatory, diffident, she sends in meagre savourless dishes & attempts nervous combinations of tapioca & orange. No, no: go she must. And then I think Annie—for ever. But the misery of these trifles can be devastating. Brown sole, brown sauce, & nothing else. And when I make a joke she laughs, as she laughed once in some tennis court to some subaltern I imagine, vainly. She is inve⁠[r]⁠tebrate; crushed; & what, I ask, is to become of her? And how am I to detach her seaweed clinging from my kitchen? For naturally this was a chance, a new start for her; something untried. And when I say No you can’t cook, she will see her hope go bang like a rabbit in a shooting gallery. And I detest these dislodgments. Nelly again yesterday: apprehensive & suspicious; though I think not shaken seriously in her belief that she will come back to her [sic]. Thank the Lord, it rains, & I can bring myself to heel easily now. Winter has set in; draw the curtains; light the fire; & so to work."
1930.10.23,"Behold, the rather familiar experiment—a new pen, new ink. “I’m afraid ma’am”, said the youth at Partridge & Cooper’s, “that the Penkala’s are extinct.” A voice on the telephone had spoken their doom. I went along Faringdon market this afternoon looking for the man with the barrow. I saw the grey towers of, I suppose, Smithfield. I almost went into St Paul’s & saw Dr Donne, now uncovered again; but being as I say to myself, pressed for time, I walked on, down the Strand.

Ethel came in yesterday evening; rather battered in an old moleskin coat; in the triangular hat which the hotel proprietor at Bath has made into its shape with a few pins. Well, I begin to make note of her, because, among other things—how many others—she said would I like her to leave me some of her letters—the Maggie Benson & Mrs Benson & Lady Ponsonby letters in her will? Would you like me to write something about you? I said. Oh yes; what fun! But I should try some experiments. Oh what fun! How I should enjoy it! But I should get it all wrong. Yes, of course; or tear them up. Do just as you like. H. B.’s letters I’m leaving to Maurice Baring; but he’ll do nothing. He’ll tear them up.

So I am to some extent Ethel’s literary executor, a post I have always vaguely desired; & so I now make a few notes as she talks, for a portrait. One would have to bring out her enormous eagerness. She was telling me how she reads Travel books; & her eyes—her blue, rather prominent eyes, positively glitter. And this is not talk about herself, or her music—simply about how people climb—their adventures. Her cheeks burn too. But she looks now & then aged: she said that she was a very brave woman. It is a quality I adore. And I have it. One of the bravest things I ever did was to tell people my age. My vivacity &c— This she copied from Mrs Pankhurst Everyone thinks I m 20 or 30 years younger. Well—(a characteristic word, indicating what really becomes necessary—a break—a new paragraph—a wedge inserted in the flood) Well—when I wanted people to realise how long I’d waited for recognition—& have never really had it—I did that—though I hated it: I told them my age, so that they couldn’t go on saying Oh but she came into her own—she was recognised. This referred I think, but it is difficult to insert one’s own wedges, to the Jubilee Concert at Berlin, on which occasion Lady Jones behaved so badly. She was on her way—is now I suppose in the train or on the ship, this cold grey day—to Belfast, to conduct her Sea Songs (one of my best things) & then, directly thats done, back she comes, across the Irish channel, & returns to Woking & goes on writing about H.B.: that looming imponderable figure: who has so queer an existence; for if I ask about him Logan, Ottoline &c. say Oh a petit maitre; a drawing room philosopher; to which Logan adds the son of a dentist, & Ottoline adds, he made love to me, & I found him intolerable. This was the man who dominated Ethel’s life, this wraith who wanders about in Logan’s & Ethel’s lives. What a strange job then to write, as I may one day, the life of a woman whose past is thus nebulous. And I have only come in time to hear about the past. Everything is past. She hopes not to live another seven years; gives me to understand that now that her last barren years have been fructified by knowing me, she can sing her nunc dimittis. Since all the fiery years of desire are over. Yet I doubt if they are quite over. Yet it is a fine spectacle, & a curious one, this old woman summing up her experience & hymning her love for H.B. as a swan song (& people say an ugly song, for they say, her musical genius is another delusion—all her life then has been based on illusions; & that as I perceive when I talk to her is manifestly untrue). I must now write to the living Ethel—so one’s perspective shifts."
1930.10.27,"How comfortless & uneasy my room is,—a table all choked with papers. &c. I’m now grinding out Waves again, & have perhaps an hour & a half to spend: a short time on Dante; a short time on MSS: a short time here—with another pen. Yesterday we went to Warlingham & sat in a gravel pit, like a Cezanne. I made this comparison, to appease myself for not being in France. And we walked along a bridle path; & saw old quiet farms, & rabbits, & downs, all preserved as by a magic ring from Croydon. Never was the division between London & country so sharp. Home, & made dinner; & read MSS: But rather casually & unanimously we have decided within the last week to stop the Press. Yes; it is to come to an end. That is we are to go on only with my books & Ls. & Dotty perhaps; & what we print ourselves. In short, we shall revert next October to what we were in the Hogarth House days—an odd reversal, seeing that we are now financially successful. But what’s money if you sell freedom? we say. And what’s the point of publishing these innocuous novels & pamphlets that are neither good nor bad? So we make this decision, casually, walking round the Square after lunch & thus slip another shackle from our shoulders. This is what I call living with a pilot in the ship—not mere drifting ahead."
1930.11.02,"And tonight the final letter to Nelly is to be sent; there it rests in my red bag, but I have great reluctance to read it over, as I had to write it. Yet I don’t suppose she will mind acutely. For one thing, she has been prepared, I think, by our readiness to do without her; & then since the famous scene last November I think she has been aware of a change. These 5 months at any rate have proved that we are freer, easier & no less comfortable, indeed more comfortable, without her, for all her good humour, sense & niceness; which now that I have written the letter, I see once more in their true proportions. And I am vague & in the air, because I doubt that Annie will come—doubt if she should—wish indeed to have livers out in future. Oh never again to have scenes with servants—that is my ambition. How we used to walk round the Sqre considering Nelly’s ultimatums; what hours we have spent & should still spend. No: this is a wholesome break, & takes 10 years off my shoulders. Oh, but I shall have to see her—"
1930.11.05,"These are further notes about Nelly, since it is a queer little bit of life broken off; servant psychology & so on. To my long, explicit & affectionate letter she has returned one word: Dear Mr & Mrs Woolf. Thank you for your cheque: Yrs truly.

But yesterday evening, an embittered, frightened angry voice, this is Rivett’s description, & by the sound she identified Nelly, was heard on the telephone. She asked for me; but I was, happily, out or down here. We conjecture that after launching her snub, she came up to consult Lottie, perhaps see Mrs Hunt, & for some reason they decided upon an interview. I imagine she has now gone back. And the sense of freedom spreads wider & wider. The letter is sent; the shock over. And I come in & find the house empty & silent.

A slight inaccuracy, if applied to the past few days. Ethel Lyn & Hugh Walpole to tea on Monday; Vita Clive & Hilda Matheson to dine; Hugh again later, & his piteous, writhing & wincing & ridiculous & flaying alive story of Willie Maugham’s portrait. Indeed it was a clever piece of torture; Hugh palpably exposed as the hypocritical booming thick skinned popular novelist, who lectures on young novelists & makes his own books sell: who is thick fingered & insensitive in every department. But said Hugh, turning round on his bed of thorns again & yet again, & pressing them further & further in, Thats not what I mind so much. What I mind are a few little things—little things Willie & I had together—only he & I knew—those he has put into print. Thats what I cant get over. For instance I cant tell you all the meanings there are to me in his saying I was like a man in love with a duchess—(the meaning is that Hugh is in love with a male opera singer). Would you mind Virginia? (this said past midnight, Vita & I alone) And I said I should. “And he wrote to me & said he could not believe that I could be hurt. He said he had written without a thought of me. But that letter is almost worse than the book.”

Clive is home blind of one eye & much in need of society. I thought him, why heaven knows, rather admirable & touching; determined not to be a burden on his friends, yet very grateful for our kindness (& I must ask him to come in tonight). So much instructed somehow in the little graces & also the inevitable lonelinesses, without his Mary, but then I think he has his Joan. And he cant read or write, & has hired a reader. Its the evenings that will be bad he said. Nessa characteristically writes from Cassis that she doesn’t think much of it, & supposes that spectacles, ‘which we all wear’ will put it right.

And Julian’s poems are out, & I am relieved—but why, vanity of my own critical powers? jealousy of his fame?—to hear that Vita agrees with me that for all his admirable good sense & observation & love of country life, he is no poet. People who treat words as he does rather afflict me—I say this to discharge me partially of vanity & jealousy. Common sense & Cambridge are not enough, whatever Bunny may say."
1930.11.08,"I pressed his hand when we said goodbye with some emotion: thinking This is to press a famous hand: It was Yeats, at Ottoline’s last night. He was born in 1865 so that he is now a man of 65—& I am 48: & thus he has a right to be so much more vital, supple, high charged & altogether seasoned & generous. I was very much impressed by all this in action. He has grown very thick (Last time I met him—& I may note that he had never heard of me & I was slightly embarrassed by O.’s painstaking efforts to bring me to his notice, was in 1907—or 8 I suppose, at dinner at 46). He is very broad; very thick; like a solid wedge of oak. His face is too fat; but it has its hatchet forehead in profile, under a tangle of grey & brown hair; the eyes are luminous, direct, but obscured under glasses; they have however seen close, the vigilant & yet wondering look of his early portraits. I interrupted a long dream story of de la Mares when I came in: about seeing Napoleon with ruby eyes & so on. Yeats was off, with vehemence even, kindling & stumbling a little, on dreams; those which have colour are rare & mean—I forget what. De la Mare told another very cryptic dream about a book with circles in it; the outermost ring black, the inner blue & so on. Yeats identified this dream at once as the dream of the soul in some particular state—I forget what. Tagore had told him he said that he had dreamed once as a young man; & if he could find the dream again it would become permanent. And so on to dreaming states, & soul states; as others talk of Beaverbrook & free trade—as if matters of common knowledge. So familiar was he, that I perceived that he had worked out a complete psychology, which I could only catch on to momentarily in my alarming ignorance. De la M. had just been to the National Gallery, & had got no pleasure from the pictures. I said this flow & ebb of consciousness made all criticism unstable. He said one must go by the plus’s always. Yeats said he could get nothing from Rembrandt, nothing from El Greco. He then explained our pleasure in pictures, or other works of art, by an elaborate metaphor, taken from his psychology; about the sharp edges of things being brought into contact; & the same order then coming in our consciousness: & thus our closest contact results from some sudden clicking to of edges, which—I have lost the metaphor now completely. Then, discussing what poems we could come back to unsated, I said Lycidas; De la M. said no. Not Milton for him: he could never recognise his own emotions there. Milton’s woodbine was not his woodbine, nor M.’s Eve his Eve. Yeats said he could not get satisfaction from Milton; it was Latinised poetry (as somebody said, Milton had (in some way irreparably) damaged the English language). This attached itself to a cosmology evidently, in which Latins & Romans play their part. And so to modern poetry, & the question of the spade. Yeats said that “we”, de la M. & himself, wrote ‘thumbnail’ poems only because we are at the end of an era. Here was another system of thought, of which I could only snatch fragments. He said that the spade has been embalmed by 30 centuries of association; not so the steam roller. The great age of poetry, Shakespeare’s age, was subjective; ours is objective; civilisations end when they become objectified. Poets can only write when they have symbols. And steam rollers are not covered in symbolism—perhaps they may be after 30 generations. He & de la M. can only write small fireside poems. Most of emotion is outside their scope. All left to the novelists I said—but how crude & jaunty my own theories were beside his: indeed I got a tremendous sense of the intricacy of the art; also of its meanings, its seriousness, its importance, which wholly engrosses this large active minded immensely vitalised man. Wherever one cut him, with a little question, he poured, spurted fountains of ideas. And I was impressed by his directness, his terseness. No fluff & dreaminess. Letters he said must be answered. He seemed to live in the centre of an immensely intricate briar bush; from wh. he could issue at any moment; & then withdraw again. And every twig was real to him. He also spoke about the necessity of tragedy. It is necessary to attempt the impossible; but it must be possible. All creation is the result of conflict. James Stephens, some of whose poems he much admires, & I have never read, was so poor as a boy that he used to pick up the bread thrown to the ducks & eat it. There must be tragedy in order to bring out the reverse of the soul. (This belongs to another theory about the soul & its antitype, which I vaguely remember in his poems). He said that Tom very cleverly made use of mythologies, for instance the Fisher King in the Waste Land; & mythologies are necessary. Ezra Pound writes beautifully when he uses them. Then suddenly must speak of—some common object—& at once his rhythm breaks. I said we did not talk enough, not easily & equally. He told us of men he had met in trains. I liked his transitions to dialect & humour. With men perhaps he might be coarse. He had been staying with Masefield who, to celebrate the 30th year of their friendship, had got young women to recite Yeatses lyrics at Boars Hill. Their voices had been too small for the theatre; but Yeats had been greatly touched. Judith M. is nice & good but not pretty. Hence she will have to marry a man she knows; not at first sight. And Mrs M. seemed simple & he liked her better than usual. Indeed, he seemed very cordial, very generous; having been warmed up by his 65 years; & being in command of all his systems, philosophies, poetics & humanities; not tentative any more. Hence no doubt his urbanity & generosity. Compare him with Tom for instance, who came to tea the day before, & may be, for anything I know, as good a poet. Poor Tom is all suspicion, hesitation & reserve. His face has grown heavier fatter & whiter. There is a leaden sinister look about him. But oh—Vivienne! Was there ever such a torture since life began!—to bear her on ones shoulders, biting, wriggling, raving, scratching, unwholesome, powdered, insane, yet sane to the point of insanity, reading his letters, thrusting herself on us, coming in wavering trembling—Does your dog do that to frighten me? Have you visitors? Yes we have moved again. Tell me, Mrs Woolf, why do we move so often? Is it accident? Thats what I want to know (all this suspiciously, cryptically, taking hidden meanings). Have some honey, made by our bees, I say. Have you any bees? (& as I say it, I know I am awaking suspicion). Not bees. Hornets. But where? Under the bed. And so on, until worn out with half an hour of it, we gladly see them go. Vivienne remarked that I had made a signal that they should go. This bag of ferrets is what Tom wears round his neck.

On second thoughts, Yeats & de la Mare talk too much about dreams to be quite satisfactory. This is what makes de la Mare’s stories (lent me by Ottoline) wobbly."
1930.11.11,"Now what will happen next, when The Waves is done? I think some book of criticism; (Mrs Stiles to take away wastepaper) But I am dissatisfied with my own smart endings. I must get on to a peak & survey the question. These are our stages.

William Plomer is back. Nessa returns, wifely ready to read or sit with Clive, on Thursday. Roger too. And I cry O Solitude—& look towards Rodmell. And the weather goes on blue & balmy. And I go to the dentist, & so does Leonard. And Rivett is a nervous but clean cook. And Nelly has appealed to Dr McGlashan. And we await development.

The other night, sitting on the floor by my side, Vita suffered considerably from jealousy of Ethel. She praised her, stoutly, but bitterly. She has all the abandonment that I, living in this age of subtlety & reserve, have lost. She claims you; rushes in where I force myself to hold back. When Hugh was here he said casually that he had met Ethel at tea. Such agony went through her she could not speak. And I noticed nothing; & in my usual blind way, made my usual mocking joke. This V. took seriously & brought out my letter for me to read."
1930.11.12,"Alas, too numb brained to go on with Bernard’s soliloquy this morning. A very little weight on me brings me low. And Clive has been a little weight, added to the usual round; the dentist, shops & callers &c. So I cant write. And last night we sat through a sticky valiant evening at Hope’s. Hope liberated from all restraint by [illegible] was it? Hope school girlish, voluble, excited, the first time I have seen it since Jane’s death. Mrs Plunket Greene there (20 years added since we met at Savage’s dinner party) now she is grey, pendulous; with the oddest bird technique of the head & eyes I have ever seen—for ever craning, peering, advancing, exactly like a lively arch bird of some kind. A Roman Catholic—not, unless you remembered her 20 years ago, a very nice or clever woman—something too insinuating."
1930.11.12,"And I had my talk with Nelly last night. Going up to sit still for an hour, & read perhaps Dotty’s poem I heard a shop bell, I thought, looked down the stairs & saw Nelly. So we sat for two hours. An odd meandering contradictory, mainly affectionate & even intimate talk. One of her preoccupations to establish her own hard lot & innocence of all offence among the servants of the click. We had treated her badly, turning her off because of ill-health. Confronted by me, she advanced this more as an excuse, almost a joke than anything. “Still I can’t understand why you won’t have me back…” But Nelly, you gave me notice 10 times in the past 6 years—& more … But I always took it back. Yes, but that sort of thing gets on the nerves. Oh ma’am I never meant to tire you—dont go on talking now if it tires you—but you wouldnt give me any help. Now Grace had all the help she wants—Well, I says, this is long service. But then Nelly you forgot that when you were with us. But then for 3 years I’ve been ill. And I shall never like any mistress as much as I like you … & so on & so on—all the old tunes, some so moving; so pathetic, some (I’m glad to say) so irrational hysterical & with that curious senseless reiteration of grievances which used to drive me frantic. The truth—but I could never tell her this—is that that kind of dependence & intimacy, with its exactness, & jealousy & its infinite minuteness wears one down; is a psychological strain. And then the gossip. Oh I wont say how I’ve heard, but I’ve heard—. You say——& so at last, after every variety of feeling, I was left with the one feeling No I could not have you sleeping here again. To be free of this inspection this frying in greasy pans, at all costs. None of this can be said, & the situation, if far less stormy than I feared, has its sharp edges. Poor old Nelly one thinks, finding a place—packing up—going to Registrys—after 15 years.

1930.11.23,"Ethel yesterday in a state of wonderment at her own genius. “Cant think how I happened” she says, putting on my hat, & bidding me observe what a nutshell it is on top of her gigantic brow.

1930.12.02,"No I cannot write that very difficult passage in The Waves this morning (how their lives hang lit up against Soon after this A B. went to France, drank a glass of water, & died of typhoid. (March 30th, his funeral today) the palace) all because of Arnold Bennett & Ethel [Sands]’s Party. I can hardly set one word after another. There I was for 2 hours, so it seemed, alone with B. in Ethel’s little back room. And this meeting I am convinced was engineered by B. to ‘get on good terms with Mrs Woolf’—when heaven knows I don’t care a rap if I’m on terms with B. or not. B. I say; because he can’t say B. He ceases—shuts his eyes—leans back. One waits. “begin” he at last articulates quietly, without any fluster. But the method lengthens out intolerably a rather uninspired discourse. Its true, I like the old creature: I do my best, as a writer, to detect signs of genius in his smoky brown eye: I see certain sensuality, power, I suppose: but O as he cackled out “what a blundering fool I am—what a baby—compared with Desmond McCarthy—how clumsy—how could I attack professors?” This innocence is engaging; but wd. be more so if I felt him, as he infers, a “creative artist”. He said that George Moore in The Mummer’s Wife had shown him the Five Towns: taught him what to see there: has a profound admiration for G.M.: but despises him for boasting of his sexual triumphs. “He told me that a young girl had come to see him. And he asked her, as she sat on the sofa, to undress. And he said, she took of⁠[f] all her clothes & let him look at her—Now that I dont believe … But he is a prodigious writer—he lives for words. Now he’s ill. Now he’s an awful bore—he tells the same stories over & over. And soon people will say of me “He’s dead”.” I rashly said “Of your books?” No, of me—he replied, attaching, I suppose, a longer life than I do to his books.

“Its the only life” he said (this incessant scribbling, one novel after another, one thousand words daily) I dont want anything else. I think of nothing but writing. Some people are bored. “You have all the clothes you want, I suppose” I said. “And baths—And beds. And a yacht.” “Oh yes, my clothes cdnt be better cut.”

And at last I drew Lord David in. And we taunted the old creature with thinking us refined. He said the gates of Hatfield were shut “shut away from life”. ‘But open on Thursdays’ said Lord D. “I dont want to go on Thursdays” said B. “And you drop your aitches on purpose” I said “thinking that you possess more ‘life’ than we do.” “I sometimes tease” said B. “But I dont think I possess more life than you do. Now I must go home. I have to write one thousand words tomorrow morning”.

And this left only the scrag end of the evening: & this left me in a state where I can hardly drive my pen across the page.

Then, as I think, I shall make one consecutive writing of the waves &c—the interludes—so as to work it into one—& then—oh dear, some must be written again; & then, corrections; & then send to Mabel; & then correct the type; & then give to Leonard.

It occurred to me last night while listening to a Beethoven quartet that I would merge all the interjected passages into Bernard’s final speech, & end with the words O solitude: thus making him absorb all those scenes, & having no further break. This is also to show that the theme effort, effort, dominates: not the waves: & personality: & defiance: but I am not sure of the effect artistically; because the proportions may need the intervention of the waves finally so as to make a conclusion."
1930.12.23,"I will make this hasty note about being robbed. I put my bag under my coat at Marshall & Snelgrove’s. I turned; & felt, before I looked “It is gone”. So it was.

Its a young woman in brown fur.” Meanwhile I was ravaged, of course, with my own futile wishes—how I had thought, as I put down my bag, this is foolish. I was admitted to the underwor⁠[l]⁠d.

1930.12.27,"But whats the use of talking about Bernard’s final speech? We came down on Tuesday, & next day my cold was the usual influenza, & I am in bed with the usual temperature, & cant use my wits or, as is visible, form my letters. I daresay 2 days will see me normal; but then the sponge behind my forehead will be dry & pale—& so my precious fortnight of exaltation & concentration is snatched; & I shall go back to the racket & Nelly without a thing done. I cheer myself by thinking that I may evolve some thoughts⁠[?]. Meanwhile it rains; Annie’s child is ill; the dogs next door yap & yap; all the colours are rather dim & the pulse of life dulled. I moon torpidly through book after book: Defoe’s Tour; Rowan’s auto⁠[biograph]⁠y; Benson’s Memoirs; Jeans; in the familiar Diary of a Somerset Rector way. The parson—Skinner—who shot himself emerges like a bloody sun in a fog. a book worth perhaps looking at again in a clearer mood. He shot himself in the beech woods above his house; spent a life digging up stones & reducing all places to Camelodunum; quarrelled; bickered; yet loved his sons; yet turned them out of doors—a clear hard picture of one type of human life—the exasperated, unhappy, struggling, intolerably afflicted. Oh & I’ve read Q.V.’s letters; & wonder what wd. happen had Ellen Terry been born Queen. Complete disaster to the Empire? Q.V. entirely unaesthetic; a kind of Prussian competence, & belief in herself her only prominences; material; brutal⁠[?] to Gladstone; like a mistress with a dishonest footman. Knew her own mind. But the mind radically commonplace, only its inherited force, & cumulative sense of power, making it remarkable."
1930.12.29,"One of my trial runs to exercise my hands. (Still in bed). Skinner was bred to the Bar, but became, unfortunately, a clergyman. Unfortunately too his wife died, of consumption, leaving him with 3 children. Of these the only satisfactory one was Laura, who inherited her father’s love of collecting & tabulating, but also her mother’s consumption, so that before she had collected, in a very orderly way, many cabinets of shells, she died; & the other children were unsatisfactory.

Skinner was rector of Camerton in Somerset, & there he remained, year after year, without any aptitude whatsoever for the souls of the living. A clever, upright conscientious man, he did his duty by his flock, by perpetually admonishing them. That they were always bad, seems strange, but was to him true. A colliery was being formed at the village. The morals of colliers are perhaps loose. At any rate, no village in England seems to have contained so many insolent, wicked, ungrateful villagers. And Skinner was forever comparing them with the Romans. His only comfort was to dream himself back into Camelodunum, & to forget 1828. But being a disciplinarian, he was tormented by the need for reproving the living. His conscience refused to let him shut his eyes upon the sufferings of the halfwitted Mrs Goold, or the iniquities practised upon imbecile paupers at the workhouse, & he must perpetually go his rounds among the sick & dying, for accidents among the miners were frequent. He was always on the side of the afflicted; never on the side of the happy. He considered himself one of the worst treated of men, & imagined malignancies & insolences on all sides. Mrs Jarrett, the Squiress, was an arch-hypocrite. All her kindness had deceit behind it. Then he was sometimes asked to a ball—to a dinner party with French dishes. He much preferred solitude to the most brilliant society. Perpetually censorious, he found fault with French dishes, with dressing up, with all enjoyment—save only that of writing & writing, long accounts of places, catalogues of antiquity, & in special, his great work upon Etymology. He met with only ridicule here too. At a parsons dinner, he was asked to explain, on his system, the name of Bumstead, which he did—& then suspected that it was all a joke against him. Suspicion always came after a moments pleasure. Perhaps the only unalloyed pleasure was found in his visits to Stourhead, the seat of [blank in ms], where a party of antiquaries stayed for a day or two, giving themselves up to questions of Romans & Britons, of camps & buried cities. There, sitting alone in the luxurious library, he enjoyed the exquisite pleasure of copying extracts from—shall we say?—Ptolemy Theophrastus; & the good Bishop of Bath & Wells made him happy too in spite of a few suspicions—by asking him to spend the week end at Wells. These however were his only alleviations. Home life at Camerton became more & more sordid, humiliating, comfortless & by degrees violent. Jeered at & insulted by the rude peasants & farmers, who told him to his face that he was mad, his treatment was no better in his own vicarage, & from his own flesh & blood. There were terrible scenes with his sons. Once Joseph told him that he was making himself ridiculous by his writings, & was insane. Attempts to keep his son from drinking cider ended—so irritating was his manner—in violent curses. The sons were always being sent to stay with their grandmother at Bath. It was his temper that was at fault, he said; but they were at fault to irritate his temper. The servants left, because he wd. not let them walk out after dinner. The farmers cursed him because he suspected them of stealing his tythes; he nervously, irritatingly & imcompetently tried to exact his due of lambs & haycocks, He knew nothing of farming, nothing of country life. All he knew was that Camerton had been Camelodunum, & his obsession on this point made even the good natured Baronet protest that he carried Camelodunum too far. So at last—all he could do was to write & write & write. The blank pages of his diary alone neither sneered, nor hawked in his face, nor mocked him behind his back, nor plotted his downfall, nor called him mad. Eighty four volumes of antiquarian lumber & daily complaint & journalising were scribbled & put away in certain great iron chests which were bequeathed to the British Museum. At last his confidant was the future—in 50 years after his death, he said, these 84 volumes were to be given to the world—which world would understand his great contribution to etymology, & take his side against the Churchwarden, Mrs Jarrett, Owen, the servant girl & all the rest of his ungrateful perpetually afflicting tribe. Fame & comfort would then be his. No doubt this secret confidence kept him going, through the gathering miseries of life. For the unhappy man was not blind to his faults. His chief misery must have come from the struggle of love & irritation. He loved his sons—yet drove them away. They fell ill, & he became all kindness & consideration—& yet how could the unfortunate Owen endure to have his father with him?—his egotistic, exacting, morose, but devoted father? He gave pain even by his affection. And suddenly the diary, written in a crabbed & illegible hand, ceases to be copied out any longer. The brother whose task it was died.

Skinner went on writing, but nobody could read his script. Perhaps the knowledge that even this confidant had failed him finally decided him. At any rate, 7 years later, he went out one December morning in the beechwoods, & fired. They found his dead body & buried it—exacerbated, scarred, covered with infernal irritation—in the grave of his wife & Laura.

Now this little narrative being run off,—& Lord, how difficult to write in bed—I report that the machine is not seriously damaged; & if I can get out, & move about, & yet not get a headache, I daresay in 3 days I shall be beginning to play gently with the waves. I dont have the temptations here of London. Not normal, but being normal is I daresay rather a fetish. All Mrs Dalloway was written with a temp, of 99 I think. How difficult though to get back into the right mental state: what a queer balance is needed. This little Skinner sketch is in the wrong order; but I dont fumble for words. Could let my mind fly, am not as I prove now, used up by an hour’s exercise.

It rains. Nessa is driving from Seend today. Vita broadcasting. That bedroom voice, singing Bach, talking of the weather, has come in handy."
1930.12.30,"What it wants is presumably unity; but it is I think rather good (I am talking to myself over the fire about The Waves). Suppose I could run all the scenes together more?—by rhythm, chiefly. So as to avoid those cuts; so as to make the blood run like a torrent from end to end—I dont want the waste that the breaks give; I want to avoid chapters; that indeed is my achievement, if any here: a saturated, unchopped, completeness; changes of scene, of mood, of person, done without spilling a drop. Now if it cd. be worked over with heat & currency thats all it wants. And I am getting my blood up. (temp. 99)

But all the same I went to Lewes, & the Keynes’s came to tea; & having got astride my saddle the whole world falls into shape; it is this writing that gives me my proportions."
1931.01.02,"This is the turn of the tide. The days are lengthening. Today was fine from start to finish—the first we have had, I think, since we came. And for the first time I walked my Northease walk & saw the moon ride at 3, pale, very thin, in a pure blue sky above wide misty flattened fields, as if it were early on a June morning.

Here are my resolutions for the next 3 months; the next lap of the year.

First, to have none. Not to be tied

Second, to be free & kindly with myself, not goading it to parties: to sit rather privately reading in the studio.

To make a good job of The Waves.

To care nothing for making money.

As for Nelly, to stop irritation by the assurance that nothing is worth irritation: if it comes back, she must go. Then not to slip this time into the easiness of letting her stay.

Then—well the chief resolution is the most important—not to make resolutions. Sometimes to read, sometimes not to read. To go out yes—but stay at home in spite of being asked. As for clothes, I think to buy good ones.

This morning Sandies brought Miranda, & she is now stood in her alcove. We went over to Charleston yesterday, & I fought, rather successfully with the usual depression. Is it their levity?—a sneer? But nothing so bad as usual. Duncan there. We came in, & the scene had the usual red cave effect—red cave in the profound winter hollow."
1931.01.07,"Well, we have just got back, had our tea, Francis Birrell has called been dismissed, & there are two hours to dinner. What am I to do with two hours? I dont want to spend them fuming over my new established & respectable household—Nelly in the kitchen & Lottie attempting concealment in the bed room. And I cant settle to read The Enormous Room, nor Madame du Deffand either. L. is busy coping with Miss Belsher & correspondence.

My head is not in the first spring of energy: this fortnight has brought me no views of the lapping downs—no fields & hedges too many firelit houses & lit up pages, & pen & ink—curse my influenza. It is very quiet here—not a sound but the hiss of the gaz. Oh but the cold was too great at Rodmell. I was frozen like a small sparrow. And I did write a few staggering sentences. Few books have interested me more to write than The Waves. Why even now, at the end, I’m turning up a stone or two: no glibness, no assurance; you see, I could perhaps do B⁠[ernard]’s soliloquy in such a way as to break up, dig deep, make prose move—yes I swear—as prose has never moved before: from the chuckle & the babble to the rhapsody. Something new goes into, my pot every morning something thats never been got at before. The high wind can’t blow, because I’m chopping & tacking all the time. And I’ve stored a few ideas for articles: one on Gosse—the critic as talker; the armchair critic; one on Letters—one on Queens—

Now this is true: The Waves is written at such high pressure that I cant take it up & read it through between tea & dinner; I can only write it for about one hour, from 10 to 11.30. And the typing is almost the hardest part of the work. Heaven help me if all my little 80,000 word books are going in future to cost me two years! But I shall fling off, like a cutter leaning on its side, on some swifter, slighter adventure—another Orlando perhaps.

I looked out at dawn once or twice—a redness, like wood fire cinders, in a frosty sky; frost thick on the fields; the candles alight in some of the cottages, & so back to bed, wrapping my clothes round me. And every morning I took the bellows & chafed up my logs, & made a game of it, & almost always won my blazing fire by the time L. came up.

How I dislike servants voices & giggles. Enough—enough.

We shall play the Grosse Fugue [Beethoven] tonight—Ethel, I daresay, will ring up. I shall go down & get the post. Tom, Lyn & Ethel have written: I am asked to contribute to a symposium on Love—& thats about all. But already we are committed to ‘see’ 6 people before Monday—the only one of importance is John Lehmann. And shall I now write to Arthur Symons about his novel? O dear. What machine is there for making 1 hour & 35 minutes blaze?"
1931.01.10,"Rather stirred by reading my own essay on Poetry in Fiction I write here instead of breaking my back over Dante. (Its true, I get more thrill from Dante, read after an hours Waves, than from almost any reading—hence the effort). And Clive is looking in for 5 minutes to say good bye. “And to see how you are” he says. “And how are you?” I say. “Blind” he says, rather dolefully. Such is the state of our relationship at 10 to 6 on Saturday Jan. 10th 1931. Lord lord, what a queer thing life is!

We walked through the little dingy streets of Seven Dials Leonard & I this afternoon, to Charing Cross Road. What a mood of tears I was in—of pathos, for Leonard, for myself; & said to him Would you like half a crown to buy a squirrel? Suddenly one is overcome with sorrow for people.

But to be connected—Lehmann may do: a tight aquiline boy, pink, with the adorable curls of youth; yes, but persistent, sharp. Shall I be paid if I come as apprentice? Can I have the Hogarth Press books? Not much atmosphere; save perhaps that his eyes are imaginative: Lord knows. And we ask 4 or 5 thousand as his share.

Now those figures have driven away my stir & the spirit of delight, whose wings were brushing me. in spite of our solid middleclass household (servants again) & over cooked meat.

I think a little Dante is indicated—Canto XXVI."
1931.01.20,"I have this moment, while having my bath, conceived an entire new (This is Here & Now I think May. 34.) book—a sequel to a Room of Ones Own—about the sexual life of women: to be called Professions for Women perhaps—Lord how exciting! This sprang out of my paper to be read on Wednesday to Pippa’s society. Now for The Waves. Thank God—but I’m very much excited."
1931.01.23,"Too much excited, alas, to get on with The Waves. One goes on making up The Open Door, or whatever it is to be called. The didactive demonstrative style conflicts with the dramatic: I find it hard to get back inside Bernard again.

The speech took place; L. I think slightly exacerbated: an interesting observation if a true one. Two hundred people; well dressed, keen, & often beautiful young women. Ethel in her blue kimono & wig. I by her side. Her speech rollicking & direct: mine too compressed & allusive. Never mind. Four people wish the speeches printed. Naturally I am rather used up—cant make the effort this morning of going on with The Waves. And am 99: & get headaches very easily—Lord, how often this drains my last chapters of their strength! And now Open Door is sucking at my brain too. Such accidents cant be avoided.

Vita last night: “If I, who am the most fortunate of women, can ask What is life for?, how can other people live at all?” in a vague mood of depression. She says she gets more pain than pleasure from praise of her books, which I believe to be true. Never was there a more modest writer. And yet she makes £74 in a morning—I mean a cheque drops in for a story."
1931.01.26,"Heaven be praised, I can truthfully say on this first day of being 49 that I have shaken off the obsession of Opening the Door, & have returned to Waves: & have this instant seen the entire book whole, & how I can finish it—say in under 3 weeks. That takes me to Feb. 16th; then I propose, after doing Gosse, or an article perhaps, to dash off the rough sketch of Open Door, to be finished by April 1st. (Easter [Friday] is April 3rd). We shall then, I hope, have an Italian journey: return say May 1st & finish Waves, so that the MS can go to be printed in June, & appear in September. These are possible dates anyhow.

Yesterday at Rodmell we saw a magpie & heard the first spring birds: sharp egotistical, like [illegible], A hot sun; walked over Caburn; home by Horley & saw 3 men dash from a blue car & race, without hats across a field. We saw a silver & blue aeroplane in the middle of a field, apparently unhurt, among trees & cows. This morning the paper says three men were killed—the aeroplane dashing to the earth: But we went on, reminding me of that epitaph in the Greek anthology: when I sank, the other ships sailed on.

My memory of todays headlines is this: Gandhi set free. Pavlova to be buried at Golders Green. Ripper murder on Blackheath. Death of Lady St Helier—who was so d—d condescending to me, 30 years ago."
1931.02.02,"I think I am about to finish The Waves. I think I might finish it on Saturday.

This is merely an author’s note: never have I screwed my brain so tight over a book. The proof is that I am almost incapable of other reading or writing. I can only flop wide once the morning is over. Oh Lord the relief when this week is over, & I have anyrate the feeling that I have wound up & done with that long labour: ended that vision. I think I have just done what I meant: of course I have altered the scheme considerably; but my feeling is that I have insisted upon saying, by hook or by crook certain things I meant to say. I imagine that the hookedness may be so great that it will be a failure from a reader’s point of view. Well, never mind: it is a brave attempt, I think, & marks something struggled for. Oh & then the delight of skirmishing free again—the delight of being idle, & not much minding what happens; & then I shall be able to read again, with all my mind—a thing I haven’t done these 4 months I daresay. This will have taken me 18 months to write: & we cant publish it till the autumn I suppose.

William P. talked more of his new novel, the Autobiography or Experiences? of an Emigrant the other night than L. has talked of his books all his life."
1931.02.04,"A day ruined, for us both. L. has to go every morning at 10.15 to the Courts, where his jury is still called, but respited always till 10.15 the next day; & this morning, wh. should have dealt a formidable blow at The Waves—B⁠[ernard]. is within 2 days I think of saying O Death—was ruined by Elly, who was to have come at 9.30 sharp but did not come till 11. And it is now 12.30, & we sat talking about the period & professional women, after the usual rites with the stethoscope, seeking vainly the cause of my temperature. If we like to spend 7 guineas we might catch a bug—but we dont like. And so I am to eat Bemax [a tonic] &—the usual routine.

How strange & wilful these last exacerbations of The Waves are! I was to have finished it at Christmas.

Today Ethel comes. On Monday I went to hear her rehearse at Lady Lewis’s. A vast Portland Place house with the cold wedding cake Adams’ plaster: shabby red carpets; flat surfaces washed with dull greens. The rehearsal was in a long room with a bow window looking on, in fact in, to other houses—iron staircases, chimneys, roofs—a barren brick outlook. There was a roaring fire in the Adams grate. Lady L. a now shapeless sausage, & Mrs Hunter, a swathed satin sausage, sat side by side on a sofa. Ethel stood at the piano in the window, in her battered felt, in her jersey & short skirt conducting with a pencil. There was a drop at the end of her nose. Miss Suddaby was singing the Soul, & I observed that she went through precisely the same attitudes of ecstasy & inspiration in the room, as in a hall. There were two young or youngish men. Ethel’s pince nez rode nearer & nearer the tip of her nose. She sang now & then; & once, taking the bass, made a cat squalling sound—but everything she does with such forthrightness directness that there is nothing ridiculous. She loses self-consciousness completely. She seems all vitalised; all energised: she knocks her hat from side to side. Strides rhythmically down the room to signify to Elizabeth that this is the Greek melody; strides back; Now the furniture moving begins, she said, referring to some supernatural gambols connected with the prisoner’s escape, or defiance or death. I suspect the music is too literary—too stressed—too didactic for my taste. But I am always impressed by the fact that it is music—I mean that she has spun these coherent chords harmonies melodies out of her so practical vigorous, strident mind. What if she should be a great composer? This fantastic idea is to her the merest commonplace: it is the fabric of her being. As she conducts, she hears music like Beethoven’s. As she strides & turns & wheels about to us perched mute on chairs she thinks this is about the most important event now taking place in London. And perhaps it is. Well—I watched the curiously sensitive, perceptive Jewish face of old Lady L. trembling like a butterflies antennae to the sound. How sensitised to music old Jewesses are—how pliable, how supple. Mrs Hunter sat like a wax figure composed, upholstered [?], transfixed, with her gold chain purse."
1931.02.07,"Here in the few minutes that remain, I must record, heaven be praised, the end of The Waves. I wrote the words O Death fifteen minutes ago, having reeled across the last ten pages with some moments of such intensity & intoxication that I seemed only to stumble after my own voice, or almost, after some sort of speaker (as when I was mad). I was almost afraid, remembering the voices that used to fly ahead. Anyhow it is done; & I have been sitting these 15 minutes in a state of glory, & calm, & some tears, thinking of Thoby & if I could write Julian Thoby Stephen 1881-1906 on the first page. I suppose not. How physical the sense of triumph & relief is! Whether good or bad, its done; & as I certainly felt at the end, not merely finished, but rounded off, completed, the thing stated—how hastily, how fragmentarily I know; but I mean that I have netted that fin in the waste of waters which appeared to me over the marshes out of my window at Rodmell when I was coming to an end of To the Lighthouse.

What interests me in the last stage was the freedom & boldness with which my imagination picked up used & tossed aside all the images & symbols which I had prepared. I am sure that this is the right way of using them—not in set pieces, as I had tried at first, coherently, but simply as images; never making them work out; only suggest. Thus I hope to have kept the sound of the sea & the birds, dawn, & garden subconsciously present, doing their work under ground."
1931.02.14,"And I had my hair curled two days ago. With some difficulty I controlled my bottomless despair when Nessa disapproved. I will front the world curled, I said to myself at 6 o’clock a m: very valiantly; I like my experimental temper.

Janet Case yesterday, shrivelled, narrowed, dimmed, aged, & very poverty struck. I noted her cheap shoes & dirty old velvet hat. I suppose over 70 now; & yet I always think of her as 45. She clings to youth. “But we never see any young people” & so reads Tom Eliot &c: has her wits about her: but oh dear, the pathos when our teachers become our learners. She has had I suppose a far harder life than I knew—illness, poverty, & all the narrowness of living; alone with Emphie; without any luxury, & the thought—I dont know about this—of leaving E. or being left. She was staying with an old man of 91. A curious clutching anxious sense such old age gives one: her face has become pointed, whitened; shrunk; her eyes remain. How I used to wait for her lesson: & then the arguments, the excitements. I was 17 she said when she came. She felt unsuccessful."
1931.02.17,"And I feel us, compared with Aldous & Maria, unsuccessful. They’re off today to do mines, factories .. black country; did the docks when they were here; must see England. They are going to the Sex Congress at Moscow, have been in India, will go to America, speak French, visit celebrities,—while here I live like a weevil in a biscuit. The fog thickens. My electric lamp is broken; (because we are having fires put [in]). Lord, how little I’ve seen, done, lived, felt, thought compared with the Huxleys—compared with anyone. Here we toil, reading & writing, year in year out. No adventure, no travel; darker grows the fog. Here, by some invisible rope, we are bound. Add to this my gnats perception of filamentary relations. With Nessa for example. I think she plumes & prides herself: I think she exists self sufficient: I think her beauty is praised; I think she does not want me; I think a million things a minute. My boasts do me harm. My reality is unknown. So I go on—this is the truck [?] of The Waves. My ship has sailed on. I toss among empty bottles & bits of toilet paper. O & the servants: Lottie. Mrs M. [charwoman] Nelly comfortably installed for life.

And I am to write 6 articles straight off about what? And a story. About what? All I like is my own capacity for feeling. If I werent so miserable I could not be happy. And the Huxleys are now approaching Chesterfield, where they will interview managers. Aldous takes life in hand. Whether that damages his writing I dont know. He is ‘modern’. He is endlessly athletic & adventurous. He will be able to say he did not waste his youth. Some bitterness is the goad which drives him on. Death comes; nothing matters; at least let me see all that there is to be seen, read all there is to be read. I fancy no one thing gives him the immense satisfaction things give me. Thats all the comfort I find."
1931.03.09,"And then I went, more than a week ago to Lady Rosebery’s—blank sealit room, buffet, elderly butlers or peers. Lady R. young & shorn. Lord Revelstoke exemplary. Caviare. Lady Oxford. A curious fierce, dart in her eye: strung; pinioned. I knew your father: your mother.. &c. Is to come to tea. Wants me to write about her book. Sense of drum & blare: of Ethel’s remorseless fangs: her irresistible vanity, & some pang too for her child’s craving for a party—how tawdry how paltry: her facing out the failure of The Prison; her desperate good cheer; her one bouquet; her old battered wigged head. How mixed my feelings were—& how exhausted & windswept & disillusioned I was—with my ears ringing, & no warmth depth comfort slippers & ease anywhere: but all effort & strain: & the sense of the futility of it all."
1931.03.16,"These few & rather exacerbated entries show, I think, the back wash of The Waves. I am writing little articles of a morning, & should have been sketching the Houses of the Great this moring, but that I have not the material. This afternoon I shall try to see Carlyle’s house & Keats’ house. Tomorrow I lunch with George & Margaret to meet the Rothensteins. Miss Holtby is writing a book on me. So we go on, until, with the sun out & the birds singing as I hope, we end this lap of the year with 3 weeks holiday. I’m ready this year for holiday. I think indeed that I have seldom worked harder, one way & another. Emotionally there has been the slight perpetual restraint with Nelly; & one fine blaze, about Lady Rosebery’s party with Ethel—that valiant truculent old mosstrooper of a woman. She is so gritty to be brother with. And I respect her capacity for ignoring me. She took to reading Dean Inge, she says, when she assumed from my voice—exhausted, cold & gruff—that ‘all was over.’ Her strength of feeling is her power over one. This drives her headlong. Her Press has been catcalling—whistling. Never mind. She has other schemes on foot at once. A curious problem—what she minds, what she thinks, about her music. She descends to explanations in Time & Tide which seem deplorably low down. No, I cannot write this morning.

Barbara, Julian & Betty Jenkins the other night—Julian in a stew about his poems. And so my quiet weekend at Rodmell next week will be spent discussing Pope &c. How I grudge it—& yet cant deny the young. Ann Toby Henderson & I go to Tantivy Towers. But enough of this moping & groping.

There is no doubt that a low mood, betokening dispiritment is more enlivening to our friends than one blown with triumph & success:—"
1931.03.19,"Ethel yesterday, very uneasy about her character; & possible misrepresentations. I think deluding herself about her own motives in countering reviewers: (purely for the sake of other musicians, women in particular: I’ve nothing to lose: have suffered neglect &c all my life). I think uneasy about her own greatness, requiring assurance, & snatching it rather hastily from such vague remarks as I could make “Thats just what I wanted you to say”—she plays a losing game very gallantly. “But I detest Bohemianism. I want fresh air, above everything. Therefore I took care to afficher myself. I was the friend of the Empress. The Ambassador was an old friend of mine. I couldn’t afford to be déclassée. Couldn’t have borne it (about her standing in Roman society).

It seems possible to me that nature gave her everything except the power of expression in music: hence the race & violence & restlessness of her nature: the one outlet is stopped up. And she for ever batters at the door; it remains locked; she flows away over me, Lady Cunard—whoever it may be with the vehemence of a tortured & baffled spirit. But she would die rather than allow this. Hence her terrific egotism: her insatiable desire for praise, since she is denied the only true satisfaction. An exhausting companion, therefore.

Christabel last night.

I put Leonard higher than anybody here—above you, who are above the rest.

My fourth child is not by my husband.



Why these candours & confessions?

She did not like me, or trust me, last night

Desmond, Velinda Benita?, Vanessa, Raymond, Vita, Lord David Duncan Julian"
1931.03.25,"And here I sit, waiting to go to the Richmonds, having lunched with Clive, about to dine with the Wolves. Wine at lunch flushes me & floats me. So with Tom. A bad thing. My hair came down. Yesterday at the docks with Harold. Tomorrow, Ethel’s party at Nessa’s. Friday Tantivy Towers—wh. reminds me to write more letters before I change. Lord Lord."
1931.03.28,"Arnold Bennett died last night; which leaves me sadder than I should have supposed. A lovable genuine man; impeded, somehow a little awkward in life; well meaning; ponderous; kindly; coarse; knowing he was coarse; dimly floundering & feeling for something else. Glutted with success: wounded in his feelings: avid; thick lipped: prosaic intolerably; rather dignified; set upon writing; yet always taken in; deluded by splendour & success; but naïve; an old bore; an egotist; much at the mercy of life for all his competence; a shop keepers view of literature; yet with the rudiments, covered over with fat & prosperity & the desire for hideous Empire furniture, of sensibility. Some real understanding power, as well as a gigantic absorbing power.—These are the sort of things that I think by fits & starts this morning, as I sit journalising; I remember his determinat⁠[ion] to write, 1000 words daily; & how he trotted off to do it that night: & feel some sorrow that now he will never sit down & begin methodically covering his regulation number of pages in his workmanlike beautiful but dull hand. Queer how one regrets the dispersal of any body who seemed—as I say—genuine; who had direct contact with life—for he abused me; & I yet rather wished him to go on abusing me; & me abusing him. An element in life—even in mine that was so remote—taken away. This is what one minds."
1931.04.11,"Oh I am so tired of correcting my own writing—these 8 articles—I have however learnt I think to dash: & not to finick. I mean the writing is free enough: its the repulsiveness of correcting that nauseates me. And the cramming in & the cutting out. And articles & more articles are asked for. For ever I could write articles.

But I have no pen—well, it will just make a mark. And not much to say. or rather too much & not the mood.

We came back on Thursday. The sun at once rose⁠[;] all the leaves pushed; the grass in the Square was literally liquid emerald. And so on. Imagine my regrets for Monks House: & how I start in the night—my early mornings are terrible battles—Fight fight—yet later I cant remember what the fights about—saying Curse, oh God, curse: as I remember that hideous new house on the top of my down; the rampart so often looked at on my evening walk. They are building the garage now; so we dig ourselves in.

And I saw Pernel & of course, on top of Pernel Peter [Lucas]; so she was cross & he was pertinacious, & I had to skim the two of them with talk about Mrs Hunt’s life of E. Siddal: not what I wanted to say. But these lovers have the pertinacity of gnats round flames: must talk, even if not about Sheilah.

On Thursday we have our fortnight in France. I intend to keep a diary so as to make each day last longer. I think I shall like La Rochelle best: I shall want to live there. I shall take a house there: I shall dream of walking there when I am old & full of sleep.

Here I will paste in—though it is hardly worth the trouble, the fitful flying notes I made, generally very cold, rather wet, with a rug round my knees, for the weather—everybody is talking about the weather. The worst April for 50 years.

That we retrieved so much from it that was lovely, ravishing, amusing & had so many good hours, spinning along the wet roads, under a complete grey cloud, speaks well for the state of our souls. After being married since August 1912 1931

1912

19 nineteen years, how moving to find this warmth, curiousity, attachment in being alone with L. If I dared I would investigate my own sensations with regard to him, but out of laziness, humility, pride, I dont know what reticence—refrain. I who am not reticent.

April 16th 1931"
1931.04.16,"Newhaven: dinner, hotel lately done up in modern style. Guests surprising. 2 young men in trousers are women. One is Mrs Pilkington [unidentified]. Conversation on phone. “Oh darling Judy .. longing to see you—Ethel too marvellous. In bed at 2.30 this morning. Now at Newhaven”. Yet her stride & gestures male: check shirt. The other had feminine face: was the woman of the two: but trousers. Nobody stared. Ordered cocktails. Other guests, man like Tartarin: bushy black beard sprouting from chin: bare ankles: yatchting cap: but English. Others a newly married pair; bride in full evening dress. Rung up. Maybe the family—her’s presumably. Elderly married couples, crossing, like ourselves, looked too respectable in this comedy film star atmosphere—at Newhaven of all places. And a fairly good dinner."
1931.04.17,"Very wet: very cold: horrid seaside marine atmosphere: all drenched & shrubs blown as usual at Dieppe. Breakfast in the usual hotel [du Rhinet de Newhaven]. Started. Wind & rain: almost black air. Rain came through. At the ferry at Quilleboeuf L. saw blue sky. Great rejoicing. Lunch at Inn by ferry—cheap, coarse; burnt fish. Old man & woman country people lunching. He had a thimble of brandy in his coffee. On again. Cold but fine in bouts. Along country roads. No houses. Came to Alençon. A white elegant old town, with a great magnolia tree all stuck thick with flowers. Heard a loudspeaker in an old house, where a girl sat under rows of jars writing. Odd little scene. Vast bare Place for soldiers. Dined badly—save for wine; a whole bottle. Guests: 4 French businessmen & one Chinese business man: a girl like Fredegond [Shove, VW’s cousin] & very old man. Talk about trains to Paris. Cold water in our bath; for which we paid heavily. Bitter cold: but suffocated with hot air early in the morning. Started for Saumur. Drove more slowly. April weather, bitter cold. Not enough clothes on. Lunch at Sablé-sur-Sarthe: not good food yet. Little old town on river. Saw old castle at Durtal: turned into almshouses or hotel; dusty with waterproof peaked towers."
1931.04.18,"Saumur, cold & wet, with gleams, though. The Loire—vast, without a single boat. France very empty. Hotel improved, hotter water. Women said they had been wearing cotton dresses—weather unknown. Saw the big round church by the river. A market. Started; having forgotten change of time. Bad morning. Went to Fontevrault. Saw beautiful bare old convent church. Dont take off your hat, said man. Its not sacred. The tombs of Plantagenets: like Edith Sitwell: straight, narrow side by side: re-painted, blue & red. Now all this great convent where filles de France educated a prison. Prison bells ringing for their dinner. Fountain where the girls washed before dinner. The cold must have been worse then. The Abbesses had themselves painted in frescoes—fat, sensual, highnosed faces.

Went on in rain across country: narrow yellow roads: old women sitting in fields under umbrellas near sheep. Biblical. Behind time. Lunch at Thouars: the food still no better than food in English Inns L. says."
1931.04.20,"Gradual southerly feeling—men playing boules. Old men getting out of cars to pick flowers in the woods. Roads as straight as rods; some of them entirely lined with trees; their tops touching. But the worst weather so far. Car shut all day. Reached Niort at 6: determined to push on 40 miles to La Rochelle. Arrived at 7.30—so quick one drives: I forgot our 2 punctures. One at Thouart [Thouars]; kept us, as the man did not mend it while we lunched. I read Sons & Lovers [by D. H. Lawrence], every word: a merry go round. Wished for fur coat. Another puncture 10 miles later. Had to stand in rain & change wheel. Scraped a hole in the road. On & off again. Went into hotel on the place. Found them dancing: so came here (de France et Angleterre) Exactly right—very ciré floors: quiet: a garden: ruins; lilac; flower pot roofs; but still gray this morning. Window open though; & not actually raining."
1931.04.21,"To Marennes. Cold & dark at first; gradually cleared. Our finest day. People at once begin lounging: put shutters up. Went to Marennes, across an emerald green marsh: deserted, a cow or two: a tall spare woman dressed in black like a clergyman. At Bourgeant ? [Brouage]—a town in an old wall; tufted with grass. Lovely country, a ferry, aeroplanes looping loop. Church in Marennes; old ship slung from ceiling. The hotel of the oysters 2 Ki. on. Sat at green table in the sun & drank coffee: L. had 12 oysters: alive: twisted in his mouth he said; green: with distorted shells. A pine wood; all silent; no bungalows. low sea. boats out at oyster banks. Very lovely drive back across the marsh. Tall marsh grasses fine yellow like babies’ hair: broad brown river. Friendly men on ferry. Home. Now colder. Car jammed. First wholly fine day. Lunch off paté & croissants in the marsh. Hotel food soon bores."
1931.04.25,"Angouleme. Fair, concours agricole braying: a loudspeaker too under a vast blue & yellow cardboard tower, higher than this hotel, on wh. is written Huiles et Tourbeaux: they sell ices at a little opening. We have been to the concours: saw dogs: Belgian hares; mechanical saws; bees in hives. Then walked, in high wind & black clouds, round battlements. Slightly reminded me of Clifton—high airy terraces, overlooking breadths of cloud darkened country. Girls drinking port & eating cakes in Thé Salon.

Before this, we went to Castillon: an adventure, driving on narrow country roads, further south than Brantome. Arrived late. Asked for dinner at Boule d’Or. Walked by the Dordogne—of majestic brea⁠[d]⁠th, empty like all France, save for one racing boat. We slept here very well in soft warm beds, though there was no hot water & the cold was so great we had to go to bed. Next day was fine & warm. I went into the Church; after the school children had left. I always wonder at the immense fund of ancient piety, dragging these blocks into mere villages. Lovely spring day. Drove 7 or 8 miles to Montaigne. Rang at Castle door. No one came. Women tending cows in ancient stables. A tower at one end. A garden with flowering trees. The usual renovated peaked & black tiled Chateau: over the door Que S’cais-je—A woman came. Took us up narrow stone steps, worn; opened thick nail studded door. This is his bedroom; this is his dressing room. Here he died. Here he went down—he was very small—to Chapel. Upstairs again is his library. The books & furniture are at Bordeaux. Here is his chair & table. He wrote those inscriptions on the beams. Sure enough it was his room; a piece of an old wooden chair might be his. A circular tower, very thick; 3 small windows looking along the wall to another tower. All that remains of the fire wh. burnt the old Chateau in 1880—or thereabouts. We wandered on the terrace. Saw the vineyards below; the shaped reddish hills & terraces: one or two brooding brown farms—much his view—the curious musing man must have halted to look at what we saw. So lovely now; as then. Americans &c. Every day of the year the woman said. A dog went with us fetching a chestnut & putting it on the parapet to be thrown. So on, through lovely shaped fields, like the south, but subtler, to Bergerac, where we had our best—our only good meal L. says. Indeed when the novelty is gone, the food is ranker & commoner & less interesting than I remembered; save for this lunch; off Monbazillac wine; pâte; eggs & so on.

To Perigueux: old furniture shops: expensive chairs: a church with green domes; scraped; renewed. All worshippers are old women; all in black; all woollen; decrepit. A random priest ambling along with different gestures. Tom’s religion. (I must read his Lambeth tonight, having read myself almost out of books). So to Brantôme—in the evening sun. Man felling poplar in a flat meadow: boy fishing; a ring & loop of waters under old bridges; smoky cave dwellings lived in since Charlemagne. Cheap, clean, elementary Inn—no. Letters. Kauffer. Ethel. Vita—about my bibliography: papers: Nessa at Okehampton in floods; determined that England is intolerable—Children so excited she cant give up the tour.

Walk yesterday. Forgot the size of maps. Found Champagnac beyond us. Went wrong at Les Roches. Arrived at an old house on a green sward, with trees & walled garden. O to live here, we said. So much subtler, gentler, lovelier than Cassis. The land is flat & green as a lawn; with elongated quivering poplars just fledged; then the spade pressed hills I love; & the river, by which we walked—the river so deep, so romantic, taking the blue thunder clouds, the willows, twisting them nonchalantly, flowing on. Clumps of purple gentian in the reeds. An Elizabethan meadow—cowslips, bluebells. But the thunder roared out. We ran. We sheltered under a ruined cave of some sort. Then dashed home 2 miles of road or more; thighs aching; thunder & lightning at Cemetery. All the tin shelters & metal wreaths gleamed. Girls, mourners, took arms & ran. Home before the main shower, very heavy.

Fair. All the women in black with kids & sheep. Pens of pigs. Man said his sister in law said fish cheaper in Paris. Clerks from the Societe Generale for lunch. One black literary man. The other very southern; mobile⁠[;] talked about cars."
1931.04.26,"On to Poitiers. Went to Movies last night after a good dinner at the hotel we shd. have stayed at. Laughed violently at animals in hotel. A light risible method—the French—of telling the story of a cycle race—done by quick drawings on a sheet. Out into cold town—all spread for sun, which does not come. Cold windy drive this morning. Country might be Hampshire, save for emptiness. No cars. Poitiers for lunch. A Restaurant. Officers lunching & their young ladies—rather provincial. Enormous meal made by a thick slab of a man—painful to see soufflé disappear. Visited churches, heard women baa-ing responses like sheep. Rain & cold by fits; so came back to read & write till dinner. A quiet homely hotel; room looking onto courtyard, but still cold. [Written on 27 April:] No central heating that night; so had to go to bed for warmth, as before."
1931.04.27,"Cloud of Sunday lifted; but heavy in the skies. Drove over high ground to Chinon; showery: a discreet charming grey & white town. Got our letters. Pleasant to be asked to wire about making a speech; & know one cant answer. A first rate lunch—one of our great successes. No comparison with White Hart at Lewes possible. Climbed the steep path to Castle. Tapped at door. Went away relieved. No woman summoned us back. Explored castle alone as usual. Not a single tourist, & only 3 English the whole tour. Saw the high unroofed room in wh. Jeanne stood before the King. The very chimney piece perhaps. Walls cut through by thin windows. Suddenly one looks down, down on roofs. How did the middle ages get through the evenings? A stone crypt in wh. J. lived: people carve their names everywhere. River silken serpentine beneath. Liked the stone roofless rooms; & the angular cut windows. Sat on the steps to hear 2 struck by the clock wh. has rung since the 13th Century: wh. J. heard. Rusty toned. What did she think? Was she mad? a visionary coinciding with the right moment. Drove on; showers; cold; bad roads; never mind—cheerful enough, till we landed at Chateau le-noir [Château-du-Loir] hoping for a small country Inn. Women holding the ends of sheets in the hall. Perpetual washing & ironing at hotels. Small child in Bureau playing with paper. Good dinner of its kind. Then the Movies began in the courtyard—talk & laughing till 12.30 or so. This damp place did its best to rejoice—valiantly, unfortunately for us. And bad breakfast in the public room, smelling of wine. So off: the day cold, but rather brighter. They call this La lune Rousse. They say it happens every year. Whether red or Russian I dont know.

So to Le Mans. Another grey & white curved, dignified, flat windowed ancient town. Letters. The Cathedral. Bought umbrellas; pen tray; lunched. The tournedos underdone & expensive. Very little good meat in town restaurants I should say; at Chinon, though, whatever it was—duck I think—excellent. Here not much to pit against the White Hart Lewes—our staple comparison. In this great argument I am always for France; L. for England. Expense seems higher than 3 years ago. I voted for Dreux; so we went there—to Hotel de Paradis; & coming in heard the violins, & saw thinly dressed girls; cheap; rigged out in ready mades from the local shop. A wedding. Dancing already at 5.30. This is the Inn that has old cupboards. Had to dine across the yard, as the dining room was danced in. Strawberries for dinner. An ice; but remembering A. Bennett, refused it. All very slow & cold. People driving up in cars all the time. Little boys scampering about in black velvet. Small girl perfectly dressed & very prim. Whole families invited: small business people I imagine. The dancing went on till 11. Then we saw the wretched waiters carrying tables across—how cynical all waiters must be & chambermaids—how terribly aware of the transitoriness of life—& the music stopped. They ate. Then at 12 or 1 (I was woken) cars began tuning up: people shouting, laughing saying goodbye. I had seen the bride dancing—a pale girl in spectacles—& thought of her borne off to fulfil her duties in some small suburban house outside Dreux, for she was marrying a clerk I should think: & they now begin to replenish the race.

This morning was our finest. I put on my shady hat & left off my jersey. So did L. And I was cajoled into considering seriously a desk; £10: then stopped in Nonancourt: found a gigantic old furniture shop—cultivated man in knee breeches well cut—sporting—a connoisseur—too aware—perhaps shall buy a bed. Then lunched at our Clara’s Bois Joli—my word! A chateau furnished each room in its own period; a chicken turned over the fire on a spit; old custom; pretty maids in pretty dresses; the usual fake; amusing; American; she said of the cowslips “Look at these baby primroses—arent they cute?” How I hate foreigners bad French. Our lunch admirable: but cost £1.10. This is Clara’s idea of heaven. Not mine. A glorified Drusilla’s teashop. Sickened me of old French furniture. Lovely as they are, things lose infinitely from being preserved not used. The sham, & the effort to tickle our vanity & feed on our money disagreeable. Lots of ancient summer houses & Skittles. An old caleche the most pleasant thing—rolled off with some rubbish in a doorway—18th Century. So here: Caudebec: & the weather is now (our last day) set fine. So be it.

Yes, thats all very well; but how to begin, & why begin? I mean what do these diaries amount to? O merely matter for a book, I think: & to read when I have a headache. After all, Percy could burn the lot in one bonfire. He could burn them at the edge of the field where, so we think, we shall lie buried. That was our conclusion after attending Arnold Bennett’s funeral.

But now, say I have a 3 months lap ahead of me: the 3 summer months. What shall I do? We are going to regulate ‘seeing’ people. There is to be a weekly black hole; a seething mass of people all eating tea together. We shall thus have more evenings free. In those evenings I intend to walk; to read, Elizabethans; to be mistress of my soul. Yes. And I intend to investigate Edinburgh & Stratford on Avon. Also to finish off The Waves in a dashing masterly manner. D H Lawrence has given me much to think about—about writing for writings sake. Two days are to be set aside for reading MSS: & they are not to leak into other compartments. These two decisions—the Black Hole, & Hogarth Press MSS, will I think make for an orderly & satisfactory summer. Then of course, being now so well off, with 2 frigidaires & everything handsome, I need not fritter & fribble about clothes; & having little sense of the duty of society left, shall hope to take my way about unhasting unresting. I want to see the fields & flowers, one or two new places; to write some good articles. At the moment, I seem able to write criticism fearlessly. Because of a R. of ones Own I said suddenly to myself last night."
1931.05.13,"Unless I write a few sentences here from time to time I shall, as they say, forget the use of my pen. I am now engaged in typing out from start to finish the 332 pages of that very condensed book The Waves. I do 7 or 8 daily; by which means I hope to have the whole complete by June 16th or thereabouts. This requires some resolution; but I can see no other way to make all the corrections, & keep the lilt, & join up, & expand & do all the other final processes. It is like sweeping over an entire canvas with a wet brush."
1931.05.15,"But it is a happy life. Those rules I made have so far kept my week orderly. Yesterday I went to Mrs Hunter’s sale, & before I had been in the room 5 minutes had bought through Mr Marchment of Shepherds Bush a large old rosewood & satinwood secretaire for £6.16. Heavens! The wood alone was worth that. It was a sordid, emulative, exciting, depressing scene. The trade was there in force. Jews, smoking pipes. Many winks & nods interchanged. Poor old Mrs Hunter’s little odds & ends were peered at & snatched; everybody seemed to be finding out flaws, & offering the least money. Marchment kept saying to me “Buy it—buy it—it’ll grow into money”. Thus solicited I did buy a shawl for 35/- & a little cabinet for £3.15. This I regretted; & I let slip—oh never mind. One must take these bargains & slips philosophically, in order to attain the perfectly buoyant & energised life which is now my aim. O yes, I dont waste a moment: I am always on the hop, with so much licence too allowed for sheer frivolity. Most plans of life are far too strict. I allow a liberal margin for pleasure.

The faces of Mrs H.’s rich friends disgusted me. Nothing is quite so coarse, cruel, meaningless, & sensual as a fashionable woman’s face, who is about 50: has done nothing but scavenge about London in cars; eating & drinking; marrying; coveting, tittle tattling. The Smyth-Hunter circle centres I think round the shires; the golf courses; the purlieus of the Bath Club & Whites. They are horsey, dressy; but not aristocratic, not distinguished. They are very well off; but lose money largely—or so at least I diagnose them. But their philosophy requires them to take tumbles bravely. When we went in on Friday to look at the things, Mrs H. was sitting at the desk which I want to buy, as cool & self-possessed as if she were giving a house warming, instead of seeing all her possessions, beds & blankets, paper knives & pen trays, all go for two or three shillings. “I see you so seldom. Do sit down for a moment & talk!” And what was I to say, to a woman old enough to be my mother, in that predicament?"
1931.05.19,"A quarter of an hour:—yes, & what to say in a quarter of an hour. Lytton’s book: very good. Thats his line. The compressed yet glowing account which requires logic, reason, learning, taste, wit order & infinite skill—this suits him far better, I think than the larger scale, needing boldness, originality, sweep. I’m delighted too, to have an argument in favour of writing v. non-writing. Compare with Lawrence. These things wont tarnish & drop & let fall their petals. They hint at force; at reserve; at the strength to leave things unsaid; the strength required not to preach; not to extemporise. Like Max, though, a small talent sedulously cultivated. And I respect that. But I dont respect Logan. I loathe the vulgarity, the fribbery & frivolity of Logan (afterthoughts).

Lytton & Raymond to dinner tonight. Desmond t’other night. He needs £300. Cant handle his book—makes excuses for leaving it with us. Much obliterated in the struggle for life.

Mrs Hunt Hueffer: “I dont remember names after my illness. But I heard my mother talking to old Mr Black as I went upstairs. I did not know what it meant—intimate relations—at the time, afterwards I found out” as she has, Hugh says, with diverse people: perhaps Hugh; who winced at her name. William also (our first black hole) about his book: rather a disappointment—an Episode."
1931.05.28,"Soon after this, I started a headache—flashes of light raying round my eyes, & sharp pain; the pain cut into me by Ethel’s voice, as she sat telling me—“You’ve got to listen”—about Adrian Boult, & how he ordered her to leave the room. And then to Rodmell, where the same thing happened—the light round my eyes, but as I could lie still in bed in my big airy room, the pain was much less. If it were not for the divine goodness of L. how many times I should be thinking of death; always knocked over as I am; but now the recoveries are full of infinite relief. Moreover, on Whit Monday the sun blazed, making the grass semi-transparent. And space & leisure seemed to lie all about; & I said, not once in an exstasy, but frequently & soberly, This is happiness. Why should I feel now calmer, quieter than ever before? Partly my disposition of life; partly Nessa Roger & Clive being away so that I am not hauled about & ruffled. Partly The Waves coming to an end—partly—I really dont know.

We went to Firle last night & brushed the buttercups on to our shoes, walking through the Park. A lovely country, even counting the villas. At Monks House we had electric light, & the Frigidaire is—today of course—working. When the electric light fused, we could hardly tolerate Aladdin lamps, so soon is the soul corrupted by comfort. Yesterday men were in the house all day boring holes for electric fires. What more comfort can we acquire? And, though the moralists say, when one has a thing one at once finds it hollow, I dont at all agree. I enjoy my luxuries at every turn, & think them wholly good for what I am pleased to call the soul.

Four young people smashed into Beddingham level crossing gates on Saturday & were cut in pieces by the 9.40 train. One man was found stripped naked, save for the hem of one trouser. Disappointed, reading lightly though, by The man who died, D. H. L.’s last. Reading Sons & Lovers first, then the last I seem to span the measure of his powers & trace his decline. A kind of Guy Fawkes dressing up grew on him it seems, in spite of the lovely silver-bright writing here & there: something sham. Making himself into a God, I suppose.

I am much interrupted again by my wish to write A Knock on the door. For some weeks I have not thought of it. It suddenly forces itself on me, & I go on making up sentences, arguments, jokes &c. Then several people have written to me lately about A Room."
1931.05.30,"No, I have just said, it being 12.45—I cannot write any more, & p. 162 therefore halfway. in 26 days. shall finish by 1st July with luck. indeed I cannot: I am copying the death chapter: have re-written it twice. I shall go at it again & finish it, I hope, this afternoon. But how it rolls into a tight ball the muscles in my brain! This is the most concentrated work I have ever done—& oh the relief when it is finished. But also the most interesting. p. 137

A letter from Desmond this morning to say that he is sending his book to Putnam because, alas, it represents his life work; & though once he thought he could have done more, he now sees this is all, & therefore must seek a more durable publisher than the Hogarth Press.

To annoy me, Mary H⁠[utchinson]. rings up & says they are thinking of taking Southease this summer. Surrounded by fashion & bungalows, I feel like a fish in a frying pan. But no doubt shall skip out. I dont like the idea of meeting Mary & Barbara appropriately dressed on the downs. Happily, some menial of the Pritchards is now hammering, & I have an excuse to go up to luncheon."
1931.06.02,"Yes, it is very important to write a few sentences, or I shall forget how. All this correcting—all this hammer hammer hammer on the hard high road.

Ethel again—All my ills, such as they are, spring from liver: I am a very strong woman, who needs calomel. After swallowing this terrific insult to the celebrated sensibility of my nervous system, I try to find out what motive lies behind Ethel & her calomel. I think; (but then I am not a psychologist) that she wants me to be everlasting: that she wants me to be unhurt by any amount of talk about the Prison: that she wants to have things—to her own will: that she dislikes other peoples illnesses which interfere with her vitality; that she likes to rationalise everything: that she suspects, on principle, all shrinking, subtlety & sensibility. Also she is remorseful for having sent me the picture of a sick monkey, but feels that if she can prove that the monkey was not sick but shamming, she is absolved. I dont know. It is very characteristic, & akin to the methods she pursues about her music. There too, to explain her lack of success, she fabricates a theory (about her kinship with the common man, & her consequent failure to attract the sophisticated, who control the Ring, so that Bax Vaughan Williams &c—are done, but she not)."
1931.06.08,"Dreams.

I had three lately: one of Katherine Mansfield: how we met, beyond death, & shook hands; saying something by way of explanation, & friendship: yet I knew she was dead. A curious summing up, it seemed, of what has passed since she died.

Then the dream of Daphne Sanger, & how she was proved to be the heir to the throne of England. And Charlie was there. And another dream which L. coming in to say that Jean Stewart wants to come to tea, has caused me to forget. I diagnose, by the way, a coldness on the part of Ethel. No communications since last Tuesday save one rather formal card. I shall lie low & do nothing.

Oh dear me no—no quarrel at all.

Two notes: the woman in white stamping on bread in Kensington Gardens: the Indian looking woman ferreting in the litter box—both wild, outlandish, in shabby finery, within a hands pace. This was last week."
1931.06.17,L. finished the first volume of his book on Sunday: begun over 10 years ago. We shall bring it out in the autumn & a reprint of The Village. He has been asked to give 6 Broadcast talks in the autumn on politics.
1931.06.23,"And yesterday, 22nd June—when, I think, the days begin to draw in, I finished my re-typing of The Waves. Not that it is finished—oh dear no. For then I must correct the re-re-typing. This work I began on May 5th, & no one can say that I have been hasty or careless this time; though I doubt not the lapses & slovenlinesses are innumerable.

A dark kind of summer. The cloud that hung over La Rochelle in April still hangs over London. In spite of this, owing to good resolutions, my little life has been adventurous & more stable than usual. There was Duncan’s show; & considerable content, indeed a kind of bubbling rapture I think, in Fitzroy Street.! must ask Nessa why we are so happy. Clive is in Cassis. Julian has grown a bristling beard like a chimpanzee & is off with volumes of Pope in MS to France. Tonight we go to the Gala Opera with Christabel. Stalls costing 25/-each.

I mean to record some literal conversations one of these days. Goldie wrote a qualified letter of praise about L.’s book: new & important ideas: the style repetitive & tedious. I distrust this, since Goldie’s own mechanical style, the mould made in Greece, since considerably smoothed out, never takes my fancy: in fact I should not exaggerate if I said that I detest it: & its currency, plausibility & general first class aspect.

On Wednesday—tomorrow—Ethel comes, & we have a party. Such is life—so gliding on. It is 12.30."
1931.06.24,"Last night we went to the gala opera; sat in the stalls, 2 rows from the stage, with Christabel & a woman, who came in late, called Lady Abingdon. Her fortune has been spent on her face. Perfectly agile, direct, slim. She has only a thin rigid trickle of a mind, & no play, range, or more than an inch of depth. But she is perfectly energised: knew what she was after. Christabel, to weld these incompatibles (L⁠[eonard]. &c) told stories of Princess Mary at Mrs Marshall’s party: how she stopped, jerked; was short clumsy, dressed like the upper housemaid in peacock blue. In the interval, old bibulous Maurice Baring red as a turkey cock, a survival from the Regency as I feel, came following, to clear Gosse’s character; which he did—but Evan Charteris had already done it—amiably enough. He has pink eye starting, & long equine teeth. Then Mrs Grenfell, whose chin, as C. said (C. is witty in her skimming way, & exactly fits this kind of thing) should have an inch or two hammered off. People passing. Old women like Roman matrons, ample, tightly girt; girls wand like: many large clear stoned necklaces & long dresses. I got the feeling of this traditional English life; its garden like quality; flowers all in beds & rows; & the ceremony that has been in being so many years. Between the acts we all stood in the street; a dry brilliant night, with women all opening their cloaks: then came dribbling through us a draggled procession of poor women wheeling perambulators & carrying small, white haired dazed children; going across Waterloo bridge. I watched Lady A’s expression to see if she had children; but could only gather a momentary schoolboyish compunction. The women, involved in this garish feathered crowd, pushed on stolidly. There was Tom Bridges; a gallant, irresistible General, with one leg, his head on one side; off the stage as it seemed, so typical of the distinguished elderly Beau. He has broken many hearts said C. but I don’t like him. C. said she might be summoned away before the end of Prince Igor. And so she went, liking this little amorous mystery. Lady A. stalked off without a good night or glance in our direction. Each of her nails was red, & cut out like a small rose petal. L. who had been reading The Lady said this was considered in bad taste; & that men, according to The Lady, dont like it. So home, by cab. Oh & my hair stood the strain very well. I believe I can now with care master my hair.

The woman who has been standing in the square for some 6 hours daily came yesterday with a sword, upon which she leant as she pretended to read the paper. This finally got upon the household nerves, & Miss Talbot summoned her in. She then spoke (said Nelly) very nicely; regretted having annoyed anybody, & said she was waiting for Dr Rowe, of the Clinic, from which we infer that she is an ex-patient with a grievance.

I was also made to waste half an hour looking at silk stockings by Mr Lowe, & lost my temper, on being asked to deposit 3/- a thing I greatly enjoy, because it makes me seem so vigorous. Now to continue Rhoda’s speech. Oh this book!——"
1931.06.29,"I had an idea for a book last night—a voyage round the world, imaginary, hunting, climbing, adventurous people, shooting tigers, submarines, flying & so on. Fantastic. Some character: partly the result of L.’s saying if we go to America we shd. not make one bite of the cherry but go round the world. Then W.A. Forster said And write an Orlando of your tour."
1931.06.30,"Yesterday Nessa gave me the picture of Angelica.

Yesterday Ethel’s indignity reached its sordid & ridiculous climax."
1931.07.01,"Today Mary [Hutchinson] & Tommy dine with us & Ottoline comes in afterwards.

We go to Easdale’s concert at 3. & so on.

Jack, as a wedding gift to Miss Mary Ashton, has stopped, not only my allowance but Nessa’s & Adrian’s.

Our takings, what with the Press & my work, have given me a bonus of £860.

And now I must go up & find Ethel’s sentimental & hysterical sheets & underline the most sentimental & hysterical passages for her benefit. Pah—as people say in Shakespeare. And John Bailey is dead, aged 67. (which makes me think—no this refers to Jack—that I will read Stendhal de l’Amour)."
1931.07.07,"O to seek relief from this incessant correction (I am doing the interludes) & write a few words carelessly. Still better, to write nothing; to tramp over the downs, blown like thistle, as irresponsible. And to get away from this hard knot in which my brain has been so tight spun—I mean The Waves.

Such are my sentiments at half past twelve on Tuesday July 7th—a fine day I think & everything, so the tag runs in my head, handsome about us. L. is now floating on the tide of celebrity: odd how the strings all begin to tug at once: asked to Broadcast, asked to go to America, asked to write the Weekly Wayfarer in the Statesman. And I am not jealous.

But I am fearful of what I call (though this much puzzles Fraulein Guide) Life. (Fr. G. is studying my works in the Brit. Mus. & cannot be sure what life is, so writes to ask me.) Clive is back, & as I observe instantly on opening the door, favourably disposed towards me. For example he says What lovely flowers! Ethel has been penitent after her fashion for her letter. That is she came yesterday, after an intermission of almost a fortnight, & defended & explained herself in a speech which lasted 20 minutes by my watch. She raised her cup of tea 6 times to her lips but always thought of some new parenthesis or qualification & put it down untouched. Her zeal, sincerity & vitality of course convince; though I’m glad to drive my stake in firmly & so avoid complete overwhelming. I shout obloquies at her like gun shots. She takes them on her solid old body with a thud like that on an elephant’s hide. Staggers, recovers herself, & stands pendant & prominent—for she has a paunch—over me. I dominate by silence—a phenomenon to her very formidable. And off she goes at 6.45 subdued—like Pinka [the Woolfs’ cocker spaniel], L. says, when she has been grouting in the rubbish heap. We kiss—she passionately in the hall, while Miss Pritchard shelters behind her door, slightly alarmed I think. But what care I might be Ethel’s song: & for that I like her.

I am reading Don Juan; & dispatch a biography every two days.

So no more.

Long discussion the other night between Ott., Tommie, Mary & ourselves upon being in the cage: Mary rampant; like a horse when a train passes a field. Must escape. Must find a brazen man & go to Spain. Why dont we do anything? Change our lives? She live with L. I with Jack? Why this hedge of telephone calls daily? Why not expose a different self?"
1931.07.14,"It is now twelve o’clock on the morning of July 14th—& (Bob has come in to ask me to sign a paper to get Palmer a pension. Bob says … mostly about his new house, washing basins, can he use a candle still to go to bed with, Bessy is moving in today, he is off to Italy for a month, will I send a copy of my new book to Count Morra, all Italians are Counts, once he showed four Counts round Cambridge, Palmer … & so on: shuffling from foot to foot, taking his hat off & putting it on again, moving to the door & returning. O & about Desmond’s book. Desmond stole some of the articles—Putnam wrote him a very severe letter—)

& I had meant to say that I am now (here Nelly comes in with a bill for 4/6 to pay for my shoes)

I had meant to say that I have just finished correcting the Hampton Court scene (This is the final correction, please God.)

But my Waves account runs, I think, as follows:—

I began it, seriously about September 10th 1929:

I finished the first version on April 10th 1930

Sept 10th to Apr

7 months

9

3

19 months I began 2nd version May 1st 1930.

I finished 2nd version Feb. 7th 1931

I began to correct the 2nd version May 1st 1931

finished 22nd. June. 1931

I began to correct the typescript 25th June 1931

Shall finish. (I hope.) 28 June 18th July.—

Then remain only the proofs."
1931.07.17,"Yes. This morning I think I may say I have finished. That is to say I which I then lost have once more, for the 18th time, copied out the opening then lost sentences. L. will read it tomorrow; & I shall open this book to record his verdict. My own opinion,—oh dear—, its a difficult book. I don’t know that I’ve ever felt so strained. And I’m nervous, I confess, about L. For one thing he will be honest, more than usually. And it may be a failure. And I can’t do any more. And I’m inclined to think it good but incoherent, inspissate: one jerk succeeding another. Anyhow it is laboured, compact. Anyhow I had a shot at my vision & if its not a catch, its a cast in the right direction. But I’m nervous. It may be small & finicky in general effect. Lord knows. As I say, repeating it to enforce the rather unpleasant little lift in my heart, I shall be nervous to hear what L. says when he comes out, say tomorrow night or Sunday morning to my garden room, carrying the MS & sits himself down & begins “Well!”"
1931.07.19,"“It is a masterpiece” said L. coming out to my lodge this morning. “And the best of your books”. This note I make; adding that he also thinks the first 100 pages extremely difficult, & is doubtful how far any common reader will follow. But Lord! what a relief! I stumped off in the rain to make a little round to Rat Farm in jubilation, & am almost resigned to the fact that a Goat farm, with a house to be built, is now in process on the slope near Northease."
1931.08.07,"Monks House Rodmell

I have just written those august words, Rodmell. August 1931. And its as good, no better than I thought. Who else in the whole of Sussex can say that? Weather all sorts; river running; boat swimming; loud speaker, camera, Electric Light, frigidaire—thus I run through those material blessings which one ought to say make no difference. Yet they do—Heal beds too: my wide empty room to wake in; to go to bed in crossing the garden by the pale flowers—the garden lit by our bright lights. We were at Oare, & I like this country better for comparing it. And I made no note of Sydney, save that he has been given the tip by God—a queer feeling; spreads round him an oily surface of superficial calm. Then I sat to Tommie. Oh dear, what a terrific hemp strong heather root obstinate fountain of furious individuality shoots in me—they tampered with it, Nessa & Tommy—pinning me there, from 2 to 4 on 6 afternoons, to be looked at; & I felt like a piece of whalebone bent. This amused & interested me, at the same time I foamed with rage. T. was late. T. couldn’t change his plans & so on. And I had to plod along the dusty streets there.

And Rosamond Lehmann dined with Lord David; & I liked her; & at last, at last, at last, on Thursday 30th we got into the car, slammed the door, & made off. And how satisfactory it has been, is being. I writing Flush of a morning, half seriously to ease my brain, knotted by all that last screw of The Waves: L. doing his broadcast & correcting proofs, no one coming, except Bells: no one ringing up; no one to say dinner’s ready, or to be stumping about in the kitchen. Annie, composed, neat, nimble, has everything disposed of by 3—which reminds me I must go & put the pie in the oven, I think. And lights & shadows & walks—today over to Northease & back by the marsh; almost forgiving the pink slate abortion on the Telscombe horizon. Goat Farm isn’t so much of an eyesore as might have been. True, one day I was frittered into fury by Worthing & Mrs W. & her sudden curious revival of arch airs that had charmed diamond merchants in the 70s. How odd that sudden spurt of sex in a woman of 80! How repulsive to me that flutter of rather cheap attractiveness—that value for Mr Legge’s good opinion—he had taken her to the Pavilion & hired a special car. “Nice eh?” she laughed, as if she were on some beach with other Jewesses 50 years ago. So it seemed. And then one saw her old & pink & wattled & overdressed, demanding amusement, pleasure, cakes, drives—but enough (as they say): I wrote these very words last summer, & this summer all will be over, with one smashing family tea, by the 25th.

Lovely are the curves of the grey clouds sweeping; & the long barns lying; Vita writes this morning about K M’s letters & says how she longs for all poets in a garden; no more; whereas Harold is becoming, they say, editor of a new morning paper & has resigned from the Standard. And are you fond of me? she asks."
1931.08.10,"No I will not let this day be a bad one, though it has every sign of so being. First an argument with L. at breakfast about seeing his family: the usual rather embittered argument: which deprives me of my box⁠[?]; & then a headache is incipient; which is caused, partly, by Charleston; where we were very gay; & I gave away prizes; & then involved myself in one of my miserable edge sitting tenebrous exquisitely uneasy dialogues with Raymond: shd. I ask him to stay—should I not? Nessa did: Nessa who has Roger, & will have Jean. And now we were to ask R. to come; & now I sit in the lodge this grey pale morning & will not go on with Flush, because of my head; & we have a day in London tomorrow; & should begin to correct my first proofs; & perhaps shall when I’ve done this. No, I say, I will not let this day be a bad one: but by what means? Quiet & control. Eating apples—sleeping this afternoon. Thats all. And now for Waves.

I have now 10.45, read the first chapter of The Waves, & made no changes, save 2 words & 3 commas. Yes, anyhow this is exact & to the point. I like it. And see that for once my proofs will be dispatched with a few pencil strokes. Now my brood mounts: I think “I am taking my fences.. We have asked Raymond. I am forging through the sea, in spite of headache in spite of bitterness—I may also get a box⁠[?].” I will now write a little at Flush."
1931.08.15,"I am in rather a flutter—proof reading. I can only read a few pages at a time. So it was when I wrote it, & Heaven knows what virtue it all has, this pressed [?] ecstatic book. All I note here though is that I feel vibrational; get violent impressions from Roger Raymond, Sibyl, Vita. Sibyl came by her own request yesterday; & I wondered after 2 hours jerking barren gossip, what satisfaction she got from it. Once she looked at the downs. The worst of being Sibyl is that one suspects every action of some motive. “I am proving myself a woman who loves the country”. One never feels, This is what she likes, as I do when Vita stumbles over the marsh & hardly has a word to say. S. looks at chairs & tables; sums one up: has a magpies eye, a larder of facts which she will hand on at her next meeting. Nobody scarcely will let themselves be themselves: & I am a sinner sometimes. Then, as we stood at the door, she tried to make us invite her to stay. And I resisted; why should she want us to ask her to stay? I asked. She had been at the Gages’, again, I suppose, self invited. As you see, S.’s company does not lead to lofty reflections; does not put one on one’s mettle, except to show off. Old Vita shaggy & stiff, writing another novel; but as careless about it all as ever. Eddy had written to abuse A.P.S. She was annoyed; then tore up his letter. Harold is starting a new paper Action on Oct. 1st: costing 2d. Cold, wet, lights at luncheon; the cat kittened in the coalhole; the valuable spaniel bitch died in childbed next door. A wet wild August, the coldest for 14 years; & the farmers here burning their hay. Meanwhile the country is in the throes of a crisis. Great events are brewing. Maynard visits Downing Street & spreads sensational rumours. Are we living then through a crisis; & am I fiddling? & will future ages, as they say, behold our predicament (financial) with horror? Sometimes I feel the world desperate; then walk among the downs. Last night, after Sibyl, after thunder & rain, specially [?] various, tender, fleeting, evanescent, I stood by the gate & watched Asheham hill cloud & kindle like the emerald it is. And all round the hills lay, low in cloud."
1931.08.16,"I should really apologise to this book for using it as I am doing to write off my aimlessness; that is I am doing my proofs—the last chapter this morning—& find that I must stop after half an hour, & let my mind spread, after these moments of concentration. I cannot write my life of Flush, because the rhythm is wrong. I think The Waves is anyhow tense & packed; since it screws my brain up like this. And what will the reviewers say? And my friends? They cant, of course, find anything very new to say.

L. is in the house making his Index & printing the photographs we developed last night.

The reason why Colefax is so dull is that she never feels or thinks for herself. That is why I should suffocate of dust if she spent a night here. Also she is forever collecting facts about one, not from interest, but from curiosity. It is a warning not to go to places like Argyll House again, * The poor woman today Wednesday writes a pathetic letter about other summers & regrets, & how all the same they drank (A. & she) their delights to the full; & the sight of us tho’ it stirred these sorrows comforted her because one is expected to make some return.*

It is a good idea I think to write biographies; to make them use my powers of representation reality accuracy; & to use my novels simply to express the general, the poetic. Flush is serving this purpose.

We had a perfectly happy day yesterday. I set up some of Dadie’s poems in the new room; walked on the marshes. L. cut the apple trees; it was a lovely day—indeed this broken weather has the merit of an extraordinary capricious beauty. I doubt that I have ever seen the downs lovelier. I am in a fix though about Ethel, who with considerable brutality to back her, asks if she may come here. When people—G.L.D⁠[ickinson] for instance—put us off, we are almost shocked; & then feel an amazed relief. Is it possible that there is someone who does not want to see us? Such royalty we have become—in our set, as Ethel says. She annoys me by telling Lady Craik that I live in a set, & am a recluse. Now, alas, I must back to Bernard (on P⁠[ercival]’s death)

One of Sibyl’s sayings, or insinuations: “Ah, if only Arthur & I could afford a country cottage”—with her Rolls Royce & her chauffeur at the door."
1931.08.17,"Well now, it being just after 12.30 I have put the last corrections in The Waves; done my proofs; & they shall go tomorrow—never, never to be looked at again by me, I imagine."
1931.08.19,"My proofs did go: went yesterday; & I shall not see them again."
1931.09.01,"And so a few days of bed & headache & overpowering sleep, sleep descending inexorable as I tried to read Judith Paris, then Ivanhoe. A note on Judith Paris: its a London museum book. Hugh bouncing with spurious enthusiasm—a collection of keepsakes bright beads—unrelated. Why? No central feeling anywhere—only “I’m so vital—so big—so creative”. True, its competent enough, spare in the wording—but words without roots. Yes thats it. All a trivial litter of bright objects to be swept up.

Scott: a note. A pageant. And I know the man (I forget his name) will hit the mark. So I’m not excited. Almost incredible that my father shd. have taken this scene seriously. But I think some roots. A perfectly sincere desire surely to amuse, now & then ruffled (but oh how seldom!) by some raid from the sub-conscious—only in the humour tho. Rowena, Rebecca, hairdressers ornaments—Madame Tussaud sham jewels. Its the design thats interesting—all flat, daubed. But I think I trust him & like him, better than Hugh. Question of morality. That we are all moralists; with a temporary standard. My anger that S⁠[cott]. wont be more intense partly the result of England’s crisis this summer, (if summer it can be called).

Man came this morning when I was in my night gown to put up Nessa’s tiles in the top room. L. in London. Joyce’s birthday. Hot still September morning. Rooks gathering, cawing"
1931.09.03,"I am taking, this is the last day—my weeks holiday, with very good results. My brain is soft & warm & fertile again, I feel fresh & free with energy for talk. Yes, I can even envisage ‘seeing’ people without a clutch & a shudder. Odd how I drink up rest—how I become dry & parched like a withered grass—how then I become green & succulent. By the way, Elizabethan prose is magnificent: & all that I love most at the moment. I bathed myself in Dekker last night as in my natural element. Surely this is a nobler instrument than Scott or the 18th Century. We listened to a Bach concert with the clouds thickening purple over Caburn, the lights springing, & the pale cadaverous glow in the chalk pit. At one moment the brown horses stampeded—flinging out their great legs wildly. The worst of it is that my brain fills too fast—overflows. Waiting for breakfast I read Montaigne this morning & found a passage about the passions of women—their voracity—which I at once opposed to Squire’s remarks & so made up a whole chapter of my Tap at the Door or whatever it is, just when I was hoping to let my mind slide off on to a second Common Reader, & the Elizabethans. No letter from Vita, to whom I wrote from my bed; & none from Nessa, to whom I sent £50. A few letters from American lunatics which I must answer, must I?—& stop writing. Will I write a statement What I believe for the American Nation. No. But what do I believe? Other people do this sort of thing. Why not I?

And what was I saying? Oh I was annoyed with Desmond’s usual sneer at Mrs Dalloway—woolgathering. I was inspired to make up several phrases about Desmond’s own processes—none of which, I suppose, will ever be fired off in print. His worldliness, urbanity, decorum as a writer; his soft supple ways. His audience of teaparty ladies & gentlemen. His timidity. How he wraps everything in flannel. (Browning said this of a cold morning in Paris). And there’s truth in what I say of Desmond, not only spite. Then his ridiculous hesitations & nervousness as a writer, about publishing. His perpetual condescension. His now permanent stoop in the back. His aloofness—in the bad sense. I mean he never takes a nettle by the leaves: always wears gloves. His garrulity. Well, let me hope that all his 8 volumes will fail, that he wont be able to pay his income tax & that Michael will be eaten by leopards. Then I shall meet him & my eyes will fill with tears. But its true—a snub—even praise—from Desmond, depresses me more than the downright anger of Arnold Bennett—it saps my vitality.

I open this book again to record the fact that this is the 3rd of September. The battle of Dunbar: the battle of Worcester, & the death of Cromwell. A heavy flagging windy cloudy day with breadths of sun: not actually raining. Its odd how I always remember father saying that at St Ives on this day, & how I am always writing something in a diary on this day & generally it is crisp & clear."
1931.09.15,"I have come up here, trembling under the sense of complete failure—I mean The Waves—I mean Hugh Walpole doesn’t like it—I mean John L. is about to write to say he thinks it bad—I mean L. accuses me of sensibility verging on insanity—I mean I am acutely depressed & already feeling rising the hard & horny back of my old friend Fight fight. This was true: Hugh wrote to say he thinks it “unreal”. It beats him. Never mind. Here I need not disguise my tumult of feelings. Lord how I hate that Hugh shd. be running about London saying the new V W. is a disappointment—about nothing—exquisitely written of course. Ought I not then to say that Brace thinks—Oh well, do let me try to give up weighing opposite impressions. Anyhow my mind is crammed with books, & Lord, I tried to speak the truth, bombastic as the remark sounds, wrung it drop by drop from my brain. So essentially I am not horrified. But The Waves, I predict, marks my decline in reputation."
1931.09.16,"Oh but this morning I’m like a bee in the ivy bloom—cant write for pleasure. John says “But I loved it, truly loved it, & was deeply impressed & amazed by its achievement in an entirely new method…. There seems to me only the thinnest wall between such a novel & poetry. You somehow maintain the speed of prose & the intensity of poetry…” And its very difficult he adds; & so on. But my brain is flushed & flooded & I’m at once inspired to write a Letter to a Young Poet. Lord what a weathercock—no a wave of emotion is in me."
1931.09.19,"And the last few days have been heavenly—At last some heat; & then, with this book done—for I don’t feel much anxiety now—think that John has hit off the cultivated view—I’m calm; oh & walk; oh & have to record the horror of 2 bungalows on the top of the hill. Yes. This iniquity is being inflicted on the downs for ever by our ‘prospective labour candidate’ [Hancock]. He shan’t have my vote. I swept off into dreams of a house far away in Dorsetshire. But O—again—how happy I am: how calm, for the moment how sweet life is with L. here, in its regularity & order, & the garden & the room at night & music & my walks & writing easily & interestedly at Donne of a morning, & poems all about me. I’ve come to read poetry with intensity—bought Skelton at Tunbridge Wells. For we went to the Easedales one fine hot day & saw the stuffed wolf; & I must now change for Angelica’s birthday party. George & Margaret [Duckworth, to tea] yesterday."
1931.09.21,"Here am I writing about Donne, & we have ‘gone off the Gold Standard’ this morning. Maynard & Kahan like people in the war. We sat talking economics & politics. Guards out: Tower defended (this a joke on M.’s part). Telephones: late edition of the paper. We’re off, & I write about Donne. Yes; & what could I do better, if we are ruined, & if everybody had spent their time writing about Donne we should not have gone off the Gold Standard—thats my version of the greatest crisis &c &c &c—gabble gabble go the geese, who cant lay golden eggs."
1931.09.22,"And Miss Holtby says “It is a poem, more completely than any of your other books, of course. It is most rarely subtle. It has seen more deeply into the human heart, perhaps, than even To the Lighthouse…” & though I copy the sentence, because it is in the chart of my temperature, Lord, as I say, that temperature which was deathly low this time last week, & then fever high, doesn’t rise: is normal. I suppose I’m safe; I think people can only repeat. And I’ve forgotten so much. What I want is to be told that this is solid & means something. What it means I myself shant know till I write another book. And I’m the hare, a long way ahead of the hounds my critics."
1931.09.27,"Lyn & the Kingsley Martins are in the house, & I have crept out here, as I say, to write letters. But talking jangles the nerves at the back of my head. And we had the Easedales too. “Mr E. was one of those jealous gentlemen, & so he left me”. Silence on my part. “I was very young, & should have taken a stronger line.” “How terrible that a friendship like that should have been broken off!” said Joan. And we went round the garden.

Ethel must be in fine feather. General, & I think sincere praise of The Wreckers. I telegraphed—dont want to write. Dotty’s mother dead. Vita going off abroad with her. And we shall publish on 8th in spite of the G⁠[eneral].E⁠[lection]: dont expect sales anyhow."
1931.09.30,"I have come up here on this the last evening to clear up papers. All is softly grey: L.’s yellow dahlias are burning on the edge of the terrace. I have been over to Asheham, in the clear pale autumn afternoon, along Mandrill walk, which we walked the night of our marriage. How proud I was of my new despatch box, I remember! So its over, this summer too; & I regret it, & want to stay on, & soothe my mind with (here a wretched little post comes in) with Elizabethan poets. Instead we go up tomorrow, & doesn’t the lift of my heart tell me that strain, about The Waves, friends, reviewers, sales, &c. will then begin to make a fiddle string in my side, stretched tight, on which lots of people will carelessly twang this winter. No help for it—So it always is with a book out.

And it will be out in one week tomorrow. But I am slightly less naked than usual, as I’ve had 3 outside opinions & shan’t I suppose get any very great variety of praise or blame. I must make up my mind about the autumn lap, & my bearing. And do some quiet work: & ‘see’ people not so wearily.

But here I am saying the summer is over—the wet, driven, rather headachy summer—so August was. September improved. How happy I was writing about Donne, up here, how happy a dozen times on solitary walks, in what a rage the day I found Hancock’s horror building on the hill, & then we had many & many a game of bowls, & there was the great financial crisis, & then going to Dotty & the Easedales, & the tremendous talk carnival—which I went through with shut lips—I mean looking for no pleasure—last week end. And now apple baskets are filling in the drawing room, & I must seriously set to & destroy & mass together two months of papers."
1931.10.05,"52 Tavistock Sqre.

A note, to say I am all trembling with pleasure—cant go on with my Letter [to a Young Poet]—because Harold Nicolson has rung up to say The Waves is a masterpiece. Ah hah—so it wasn’t all wasted then. I mean this vision I had here has some force upon other minds. Now for a cigarette, & then a return to sober composition."
1931.10.08,"Well, to continue this egotistic diary: I am not terribly excited: no: at arm’s length more than usual all this talk, because if The W. is anything it is an adventure which I go on alone: & the dear old Lit Sup. who twinkles & beams & patronises—a long, & for The Times, kind & outspoken review—dont stir me very much. Nor Harold in Action either. Yes; to some extent; I shd. have been unhappy had they blamed, but Lord, how far away I become from all this; & we’re jaded too, with people, with doing up parcels.

I wonder if it is good to feel this remoteness—that is, that The W. is not what they say. Odd, that they (The Times) shd. praise my characters when I meant to have none. But I’m jaded; I want my marsh, my down, & quiet waking in my airy bedroom. [LW] Broadcasting tonight; to Rodmell tomorrow. Next week I shall have to stand the racket."
1931.10.09,"Really, this unintelligible book is being better ‘received’ than any of them. A note in The Times proper—the first time this has been allowed me. And it sells—how unexpected, how odd that people can read that difficult grinding stuff!"
1931.10.14,"A note. For since The Waves my brain wont stand hard writing-writing that must fetch a compass. I’m muscularly strained. So I stop my Letter to John & note that The W. has beaten all my books: sold close on 5,000; we are reprinting: so far, save for Hayward & Ethel, no letters. None of my presentees have written. This silence always lasts a week or two. The reviews I think the warmest yet. And so on. But Vita found it desperately dull—anyhow for 100 pages. What shall I say to Virginia? I cant get through it. Up rings Dotty. Cant get through it. Two hours later “I’m getting along better” Still, V. finds it absolutely intellectual: all one person speaking: profound loneliness of the soul; will never like it as much as the others.. Dear me, I spent 20 minutes dashing off a cooks talk—so much I need random rollicking humour. Oh what a grind that was! It comes over me now. Literally I have a pain in my head—but my head has many pains—when I try to stretch another book—And yet of course I envisage The Tree. But help help, stop stop I cry to my brain. Dont torture me again. Wreckers tonight & supper with Vita, L. & Ethel at the Eiffel Tower afterwards."
1931.10.15,"Conversation last night. Stulik at the Eiffel Tower. I am talking about Schnitzler: I tell you he had six potatoes here & a bag of flour. He said “Give them to my people. I do not want them.” He had six potatoes & a bag of flour. He said “My people are starving. I do not want your alms.”….

E⁠[thel] S⁠[myth]: But they have not heard of Schnitzler. We are not musical … the English are not artists. You belong to the only race where every man one meets in the street is an artist.

Of course these people have heard of Schnitzler … And he said Take them—I do not want them. Give them to the people who are starving. He had six potatoes & a bag of flour …

Stulik has had a fit & was mildly drunk.

My heart beat when I saw you—(bowing to me with his hand on his heart) come in .. It is long years since you used to come here—you lived in Bedford Square—you had a studio—& there was Lady Utto—she used to come—And my heart leapt, Sir, when I saw you again after all these years. When you came into the room, I felt….

Going through contortions like one swimming with his arms crossing themselves on his breast There sat Rex Whistler & Malcolm Bullock in a corner. E. held forth about Parsifal; & our quarrel—dressed in pale blue with white shoes pinned with safety pins. And some of the W⁠[reckers]. was vigorous & even beautiful; & active & absurd & extreme; & youthful: as if some song in her had tried to issue & been choked [?]."
1931.10.17,"More notes on The Waves. The sales, these past 3 days have fallen to 50 or so: after the great flare up when we sold 500 in one day, the brushwood has died down, as I foretold. (Not that I thought we should sell more than 3,000). What has happened is that the library readers cant get through it & are sending their copies back. So, I prophesy, it will now dribble along till we have sold 6000 & then almost die, yet not quite. For it has been received, as I may say, quoting the stock phrases without vanity, with applause. All the provinces read enthusiastically. I am rather, in a sense, as the M’s would say, touched. The unknown provincial reviewers say with almost one accord, here is Mrs Woolf doing her best work; it cant be popular; but we respect her for so doing; & find The Waves positively exciting. I am in danger, indeed, of becoming our leading novelist, & not with the highbrows only. To show how slow a book it is, not only do Vita & Dotty find the first 100 pages boring in the extreme, but I have as yet (10 days after publication) had only 3 letters about it. Nessa’s enthusiasm is the brightest spot. And, to annotate further, the lack of sales has had the providential effect of steadying & quieting me, so that I can get back to work, & have already lost the flush & flutter of what seemed like complete success. So now, what shall I work at? So many works hover over me."
1931.10.20,"I trotted out yesterday & laid in a stock of Elizabethans. I should like to write a chapter called Some Ethans as prelude to the 2nd Common Reader.

I had a visit from Peter Lucas t’other night. No, he had not read The W. But he has written an Epic. He is working as usual like a miner—bright red all over—egotistic—nice, charming, boyish, hard, imperceptive, not a writer I mean, though set on writing, & indeed has a play being acted. Both our books move slowly; but L.’s I suspect with a giants foot, like an elephant through the undergrowth. Laski says, as reviewers say these things, it is a masterpiece. We makers of masterpieces remain very calm, very well content. We went to the Motor Show, for instance, last Saturday (autumn deepening) & approved The Star, which indeed we could buy if we wished. It’s a queer reversal. Here’s Lottie out of a place & Mrs Hunt wont accept fees as places aren’t to be had. How things have spun these 2 or 3 years then!

Oh its blue again over my skylight—please God it stays blue over our week end, the blessed Rodmell week end. Vaguely looking for houses again, & turning over plans for removing. All houses pale though before this one. I’m asked to be Godmother to Noel Richards’ daughter. Yet she wont dine here. Election rampant. Plomer & DoBree dined the other night. He a nimble secondrate man: his grandfather the pawnbroker in Vanity Fair."
1931.10.23,"Oh but I have been made miserable—damped & disheartened—this is no exaggeration—because the Lit Sup. only gave half a column of belittlement to After the Deluge. Not that I should have cared more than a moments damn at them for the usual insignificant spiteful methods—wreaking their politics upon books they dont agree with. But L. says—& honestly believes—that this puts an end to the book—Yes he says no less than that. He says his ten years work are wasted, & that he sees no use in going on. His argument is that he wrote this book for the wider public; that this public is at the mercy of Librarians; that librarians take their orders from the Lit Sup; that they judge by the length of the review; that no librarian will advise spending 15/- after this review; so that, however Laski & the experts may applaud, as they do, in the serious weeklies, his book is dead; his work wasted. He remains with a public of experts who are poor; his sales wont reach 500 in 6 months & so on. For my own part I think this a very curious illustration of his psychology. On Sunday he told me that this was bound to happen; yet we have seldom been happier—True he said he expected one col. or one & ½ of abuse instead of ½;—Oh but the arguments which we have beaten out I daresay for 6 hours, walking in the Sqre, sitting over the fire—utterly cloud my mind. Its his curious pessimistic temper: something deeper than reason, strangling, many coiled, that one cant deal with. Influenza has exactly the same effect, liberating the irrational despondency which I see in all Woolves, & connect with centuries of oppression. The world against us &c. How can one laugh off the ½ column therefore? And when I say this morning incautiously, “I’m reviewed in the M⁠[ancheste]⁠r Guardian” L. says “Is it a long review?” And Isay, feeling like a mother to a hurt & miserable little boy, Yes. Lord what human beings are!

Now it pours; & are we to go to Rodmell?"
1931.10.30,"Happily that morbidity of L.’s is over. Other things have intervened, & praise & some sale And the General Election which has returned I think 26 Labour members to Parliament. But as I went to James’s to hear the results, was in the midst of a chattering crowd (Nina Hamnet drunk) my head aches. I rubbed the ache in dining at the Woolf family party last night. Cant write, cant read. Oh—yesterday we made an offer for 47 Gordon Sqre—a house where we may die; for its a 24 years lease. Strange to anchor there again. In order that these notes may remain solid I make them; but cannot comment."
1931.11.16,"But we are not to live & die in 47. The Bedford Estate wont house a publisher; would create a precedent; vans would stop at the door. Unexpectedly complaisant, though, Mr Upton told us that we may stay on here past our term: the side of the Sqre is to be pulled down; but times are bad for building; & they will treat us with consideration. So we stay on, anyhow this next year. With John doubtful (I murmur this in secret) it is wisest so: & Lord, how I love the chance of any escape—from what? to what?

I’m disoriented; have been to the City & seen St Bartholomew’s. Came back to wait Vita. Vita has to take Dotty to a nursing home, so cant come; my evening spoilt—mind cant settle. Whats to become of Lottie, still out of a place? Nessa rings up. Will Clive have her? I am reading Clive’s book.

Here I will give myself the pleasure—shall I?—of copying a sentence or two from Morgan’s unsolicited letter on The Waves:—

“I expect I shall write to you again when I have re-read The Waves. I have been looking in it & talking about it at Cambridge. Its difficult to express oneself about a work which one feels to be so very important but I’ve the sort of excitement over it which comes from believing that one’s encountered a classic”

I daresay that gives me more substantial pleasure than any letter I’ve had about any book. Yes, I think it does, coming from Morgan. For one thing it gives me reason to think that I shall be right to go on along this very lonely path. I mean in the city today I was thinking of another book—about shopkeepers, & publicans, with low life scenes; & I ratified this sketch by Morgan’s judgment. Dadie agrees too. Oh yes, between 50 & 60 I think I shall write out some very singular books, if I live. I mean I think I am about to embody, at last, the exact shapes my brain holds. What a long toil to reach this beginning—if The Waves is my first work in my own style!

To be noted, as curiosities of my literary history: I sedulously avoid meeting Roger & Lytton whom I suspect do not like The Waves. I suspect that it is dubbed a failure also by Ottoline, Colefax, Mary, & Christabel. Lord David does not care for it, nor Hugh Walpole. I sit tight here in my fastness, only sedulously avoiding any meeting with Roger & Lytton. Why do I imagine that they are both hostile towards me, because of The Waves? It is unlikely—No; I disliked Lytton for writing Q. Eth. I remember.

But oh the happiness of this life—

I was thinking to myself today, few people in Cheapside can be saying “It is too good to be true—that L. & I are going to dine alone tonight.” Then of course, for no reason, L. is rather silent & sad at tea; Vita does not come; I cant get on with Philip Sidney; & so my perfect crystal globe has a shadow crossing it. L. is now printing; & perhaps dinner will be all I planned. And if its not, my happiness is too substantial to be tarnished. [Added later:] But dinner was very good.

I am working very hard—in my way, to furbish up 2 long Elizabethan articles to front a new Common Reader: then I must go through the whole long list of those articles. I feel too, at the back of my brain, that I can devise a new critical method; something far less stiff & formal than these Times articles. But I must keep to the old style in this volume. And how, I wonder, could I do it? There must be some simpler, subtler, closer means of writing about books, as about people, could I hit upon it.

[Added later:] (The Waves has sold more than 7,000. The Deluge is selling very well)

Theres always somebody playing a concertina if one has the window open at the back—a kind of bagpipe concertina. That reminds me, I scribble a page of what is called, I think, Diary or Calendar every morning, before setting to upon Harvey, in which I catch such reflections—& shall one day publish them in a square grey-papered covered volume, very thin: a kind of copy book, with a calendar of the month stamped upon it."
1931.11.17,"Yes I forget, why do I want to write here, what do I want to say? with half an hour to lunch. A foggy morning; & Vita rings up; & I say (chiefly owing to my dream that she had gone off with someone, very markedly, at a party, in a small house whose room I was about to make into my study by knocking down a wall—I still see it: I hear Nessa saying She’s tired of you: then my teeth broke; then as I say Vita went off triumphantly with somebody, being sick of me; & so I woke, about 4.30, & decided that I would be firm if she rang me up & asked me to lunch with her & Gerald Heard. In truth she did do this: & I was firm; & she was charming & warm & trusty & friendly, & said she would come in this evening then, as she so much wanted to see me. Really my firmness was due to my dream).

Isnt it odd that I’m really, I believe, ostracised by some of my friends, because of The Waves, & lifted to the highest pinnacle by others, because of it? Dadie, for instance, & Goldie: but Morgan is the only one, either side, that matters.

Friday Xmas morning

Lytton is still alive this morning. We thought that he could not live through the night. It was a moonlit night. Nessa rang up at 10 to say that he has taken milk & tea after an injection. When she went to Hungerford yesterday they were in great despair sitting round. He had taken nothing for 24 hours & was only half conscious. This may be the turn, or may mean nothing. We are lunching with the Keynes’. Now again all one’s sense of him flies out & expands & I begin to think of things I shall say to him, so strong is the desire for life—the triumph of life.

A soft misty morning.

After writing the last page, Nov. 16th, I could not go on writing without perpetual headache; & so took a month lying down; have not written a line; have read Faust, Coningsby &c. & seen Clive, Christabel, Nessa, Miss Bowen, Alice Ritchie: until the last 14 days, when I heard about Lytton. He has been ill a month. I have lived through again all grades of feeling: then the telephone; then Angelica coming; then going to see James; then coming here last Tuesday, a dark drive, a tree reminding me of Lytton. Brighton yesterday. All very quiet, misty; a blue sky & white clouds last night. Talk to L. last night about death: its stupidity; what he would feel if I died. He might give up the Press; but how one must be natural. And the feeling of age coming over us: & the hardship of losing friends; & my dislike of the younger generation; & then I reason, how one must understand. And we are happier now."
1931.12.23,"Last night—I go to Miss Dixey’s to telephone—“the improvement continues”. I say this must mean that the stout Strachey constitution has triumphed. For 48 hours L. has been better, & now, Nessa says, realises that he is better, & eats; whatever he is allowed. I am therefore freely imagining a future with my old serpent to talk to, to laugh at, to abuse: I shall read his book on Sh⁠[akespea]⁠re; I shall stay at Ham Spray; I shall tell him how L. & I sobbed on Christmas Eve.

But this page is one of my trials to test my brain. If successful I shall go out to the Lodge tomorrow, light my electric fire, & potter about. I am cross with Desmond, for talking about dreaming subjectivity & The Waves; I have been making phrases about his damnable tepidity—he who neither loves nor hates—in short I’m in a healthy condition. And it is, remarkably, April the First. L. cant come in. I’ve been pacing the terrace. The sun is flooding the downs. The leaves of the plant in the window are transparent with light. My brain will be filling. We shall go to Lewes tomorrow. All is again released, though I shall have some trepidation about the telephone. Lunching with the Keynes, they took Lytton philosophically. “Is he alive?” Lydia asked. She had 3 helps of turkey. Maynard said that Lytton’s last relations had been very thin. He was not sure when he saw him last. He was not really changed; nothing of importance had happened. They did not go to Ham Spray because Lydia disapproves of the immorality of Carrington. She is a dog in the manger. The relationships are hypocritical.

And what d’you feel about immortality, Maynard? I asked. “I am an idealist,” said Maynard, “& therefore on the whole I suppose I think that something may continue. Clearly the brain is the only exciting thing—matter does not exist. It follows therefore…. but one is very vague.” So, more or less, he said. And L. said death was stupid like a motor accident. And M. said that Mrs Courtauld was dying, might be dead that moment. And he wished one cd. die at once: there should be death arranged for couples simultaneously, like himself & Lydia, me & Leonard. But he always supposed he would die before Lydia, & I, I said, before Leonard. Then Lydia & Leonard will marry. They will combine all these dogs—(dogs were wandering about.) And so home. And I kissed Maynard. And they are coming to tea.

I can write so far, if it is to be called [writing,] not an effusion of this old pen, without racing or pain. But when it comes to the screw—the screw that I give, & Desmond doesn’t—"
1931.12.29,"Lytton is, if anything, better. I need not ring up Nessa today, which is a matter of exquisite relief. It seems as if he were now to be seriously ill with ups & downs for some time. They say it is positively not typhoid but ulcerated colon. Well, we have lived through every grade of feeling—how strong, how deep—more than I guessed, though that cavern of horror is well known to me. Soon the whole being can suffer no more: I cant feel anything, I say as I lift the receiver, sitting on Miss Dixey’s bed & eying with intensity her shining table & the two pale blue wine glasses; the tea caddy; & the gilt framed picture of a Victorian lady. There was also a little pile of books, a few letters, & The Dog World. In these acute states emotions are much simplified—there is none of the complexity that I feel this morning about Lytton, when I expect him to recover. I feel annoyance, humour, the desire to laugh with him.

It is a bitter windy morning, & Caburn, when I came in was white with snow. Now it is black. Shall I ever ‘write’ again? And what is writing? The perpetual converse I keep up. I’ve stopped it these 5 or 6 weeks. That excitement, which becomes a habit, is over. Why take to it again? I am dispassionate. Books come gently surging round me, like icebergs. I could write a book of caricatures. Christabel’s story of the Hall Caines suggested a caricature of Country house life, with the red-brown pheasants, Then there’s Flush: theres the Knock on the door; there’s the appalling novel; theres Common Reader … there’s my little letter to a Poet. But I’m deficient in excitement; dont feel, as I did after many such illnesses, if I dont write I shall whizz into extinction like an electric globe fused.

That makes me think that our 3 black swans came last night. I will finish this book, & begin another for 1932. And now I have a vast choice of reading matter, & feel no sort of inclination to reply to the flattering invitation of Chatto that they should reprint my books. So Faber wishes too. And L. has sold his 450; & I 9400—what figures!"
1932.01.01,"This is to be quite frank the 1st Jan. 1932, but I will pretend that it is still 1931: so that I may spend the 25 minutes to lunch writing here. I will bring a new book down tomorrow. The truth is I cannot write—but must scribble. My attempt to polish up John’s letter in the lodge yesterday was a failure. Am I more severe, deeper, less of a flibbertigibbet now than of old, so that writing exacts a closer screw?—& my head is twisted with the effort? I think that possible. Anyhow, I must sail over the 7 days left here as smoothly, vacantly, serenely as may be. And use this page to sail on.

Waves have sold 9,650—Deluge 440 (?)

Yesterday we had Keynes’s & Bells to tea. Mrs Courtauld is dead. Lytton, as I must believe, very slowly mending. And I must repay a vow made in my sorrow—to send £10 yearly to old Sophie. Only when my brains dry up I feel nervous. Action is dead—O these dogs—thats my present curse. And one must learn to overcome it somehow. This irregular sharp bark is the devil. Ear stoppers? Clive as bright as a bullfinch. We talked of going to bed in front of Angelica. And of Desmond’s maniacal lies—“I have posted the article” when he hasn’t written it. And of the Stracheys;—Nessa’s description of the lounge at the Bear filled with Stracheys reading detective novels in despair. In comes Ralph. Silence. “Would you like to come, Pernel?” Pernel elongates herself & goes to get ready. “Gently fading away?” says Oliver. Ralph nods. Dorelia is summoned to be with Carrington, who will commit suicide they think. She leaves. Wires for a little bag with some money that she took out of John’s dressing gown—he might be annoyed. A man appears with the bag. Is this yours? They look & find £300 in notes inside. (I am now stopped against the dogs; but it is difficult to write stoppered; & foolish; & an extravagant demand on me by Miss Dixey; & if a knock were to come I should not hear—& the dog after all may stop barking.) Carrington moving about scarcely knowing people: Pippa violently self-controlled; Saxon helping by—I forget what; Tommie helping, too, but summoned to comfort his parents for the death of Garrow in an air spill; & the Stracheys, all grey, all woollen, all red nosed, swollen eyed, logical, quiet, exact, doing cross word puzzles; thinking of Lytton. And that afternoon (Christmas Eve) Lytton said “If its only keeping me alive a little longer, dont”. And so they did nothing; but then he drank tea & milk with brandy & enjoyed them, & the Dr happily had some serum, injected it, & so the turn—if turn they call it—began. This is a scene I can see; & see Lytton too, always reasonable, clear, giving his orders; & dying as he thought; & then, as reasonably, finding some strength returning, deciding to live. And L. & I sobbing here. And I expect Nessa & Clive sitting over the fire late, with some tears, at Seend.

During the last days here, they have been putting up a great erection of girders on the bank opposite Asheham. Is this an overhead railway or an engine house? So another view of the downs is lost forever. And Anny repeats vague gossip that there is to be a series of factories between Newhaven & Lewes: are we doomed to go—or to stay on & be worried out of all walks, all views, & become crusted over with villas?

[Diary XXI]"
1932.01.13,"Oh but this is, as I always say, making an apology myself to myself, not the first day of the year. It is the thirteenth, & I am in one of those lassitudes & ebbs of life when I cannot heave another word on to the wall. My word, what a heaving The Waves was, that I still feel the strain!

We came back from Rodmell last Sunday afternoon—a wet evening, & comfortable to be back, here high up in the air, beyond barking dogs. “I shall go bankrupt if those dogs bark any more” I said to Anny with some vehemence, & this, implying her ruin, made her speak to Elsie, & the dogs fell silent. Miss Belsher is reported ‘very ill’. L. is to see father No: it was to get money—she was a notorious swindler who did Hugh out of £70. Belsher this afternoon, & I am to see Mrs Thring ‘on a private & confidential matter’ which I guess to be the printing of a little book of poems by herself. Time—3.30 to be exact—will prove. Then Miss Cashin is ill too; the press is supported on 2 legs, one the stout leg of good-natured Walton. John labours too, more nervously, & feels jaded, & wants a week off, & wants also, to be our manager, not partner, but to stay in that capacity. So, perhaps, & perchance—for I make no rash boasts—the dear old Press to which I owe so much labour—witness the pile of MSS before me—& fun—oh yes, a great deal of variety & oddity, life on tap down here whenever it flags upstairs—may now settle down for life. For our lives. How long will they be? Can we count on another 20 years? I shall be fifty on 25th, Monday week that is; & sometimes feel that I have lived 250 years already, & sometimes that I am still the youngest person in the omnibus. (Nessa said that she still always thinks this, as she sits down.) And I want to write another 4 novels: Waves, I mean; & the Tap on the Door; & to go through English literature, like a string through cheese, or rather like some industrious insect, eating its way from book to book, from Chaucer to Lawrence. This is a programme, considering my slowness, & how I get slower, thicker, more intolerant of the fling & the rash, to last out my 20 years, if I have them. Lytton goes on, now better, now not so well. And one has taken him back after those sepulchral days when he seemed vanished as part of life. Leonard said “We must make up our minds that we shall never see Lytton again”;—or something like that, which made us feel bereft; the end of a section; & now I say it is not the end.

And Vita supports the weight of the Nicolsons on her shoulders, working, working working so that she cant sleep o’nights, Ethel says Hilda says. But why? People should ride life like a horse. This money accumulating, keeping sons at Eton & Long Barn & Siss⁠[inghurs]⁠t in full swing seems to me a little servile: save that she loves generosity & is industrious, & has that queer vein in her of thinking the slogging money making ant like worker, the independent, the professional, romantic. And so she scribbles reviews, broadcasts—pray heaven I may never fall into the money-trap!"
1932.01.18,"And then we heard that Lytton was very ill again—they had thought him dying on Sunday. “Give him morphia—it makes no difference” the Dr said. So down we went to Ham Spray on Thursday. So hot, so fresh. The larks singing over the petrol pumps I remember on the Great West Road as we stopped to fill up. They were strained, silent, held in a lock [?]. Then tears—Pippa sobbing on my shoulder at the Bear after lunch—hopeless almost—he is so ill—how can he get better? Then back to Ham Spray—how lovely, with its flat lawn, & the trees grouped & the down rising & the path climbing the down: this I noted, with envy thinking of my dogs barking, my downs ruined, as we sat at tea. I long sometimes for this sealed up, silent, remote country: long for its little villages; its muddy roads, its distance from Brighton & Peacehaven—the roads that go on to Bath, to Oxford, driving through solid England. And so home again, leaving them in the frail lovely house, with hospital nurses popping in & out, all orderly arranged as after long weeks of illness: a light in Lytton’s room, the shadow of a screen. He said he liked our coming. Odd to come thus, after all these years. Again today Carrington writes he is slightly better."
1932.01.21,"And last night Lytton was dying “much worse” Oliver telephoned; & this morning “much better again”. So we go to Angelica’s party in fancy dress. It is like having the globe of the future perpetually smashed—without Lytton—& then, behold, it fills again."
1932.01.22,"Much better was much weaker. Lytton died yesterday morning.

I see him coming along the street, muffled up with his beard resting on his tie: how we should stop: his eyes glow. Now I am too numb with all the emotion yesterday to do more than think thoughts like this. Well, as I know, the pain will soon begin. One toys about with this & that. How queer it was last night at the party, the tightness round everyone’s lips—ours I mean. Duncan Nessa & I sobbing together in the studio—the man looking out of the mews window—a sense of something spent, gone: that is to me so intolerable: the impoverishment: then the sudden vividness. Duncan said “One misses people more & more. It comes over one suddenly that one will tell them something. Then the pang comes over one, after years”. Nessa said, What would one like if one died oneself? that the party should go on. He is the first of the people one has known since one was grown up to die she said. It was very hopeless. One knows now how irremediable—but no: I cant think of any words for what I mean, & yet go on writing, numb, torpid as I am. We are going down to Rodmell this afternoon I think. Pippa & James come up today. Carrington & Ralph tomorrow. What is to happen now to Carrington? Yes, 20 years of Lytton lost to us, stupidly: the thing we shall never have again."
1932.01.30,"Oliver to dinner last night. His cheeks are softer, fatter: he looks a codger, a card; an old buffer. I am alert now to take these signs, as if I saw us all becoming figures: rigid, inert. Well: we talked. “Never never have I known so odd a character as Karin. Women want children. Ray wants babies. I wont have them. Theres no money for anybody. Of course I’m odd—so cold, unemotional. I haven’t any feelings as a parent. I saw Ruby in November—after 10 years. Oh yes we shall meet. Why shouldn’t we? She was a liar—thats all—couldn’t tell the truth. But very attractive. The boy is Hunter’s son. But they call him Strachey on his birth certificate. Do you know both the boys are Stracheys—said Ruby. She’s had 5 children, never by the same man. Lytton was a great man. Oh the excitement. I came back from India starved, & found—all that.” Lytton has left all books printed before 1841 to Senhouse. Why before 1841? “Some private joke I imagine. Senhouse might have preferred £1000. The unfortunate thing was that Lytton fell in love with Ralph…. You know what Jeans says? Civilisation is the thickness of a postage stamp on the top of Cleopatra’s needle; & time to come is the thickness of postage stamps as high as Mont Blanc. Possessiveness is the devil. Inez is a little too possessive. The ideal is to cease being in love simultaneously & then it passes into another state. Nobody can be in love for more than 5 years. They cant leave Carrington alone. She says she will kill herself—quite reasonable—but better to wait until the first shock is over & see. Suicide seems to me quite sensible. We’ve been born too early. Soon they’ll have found a way of curing these growths. Yes—there was an autopsy. Pippa came down—we had kept it from her—& said Oughtn’t we to have one? It had just been done. It was cancer, an early stage. Nobody guessed it—nobody could have guessed it—” This led to a long argument about doctors. Oliver is a tough old buffer: with one flame inside of him. What the Americans call ‘culture’. “Thats the only thing: to realise the legacy thats been left us. To read. To do nothing from 18 to 22 but read. Thats what we did. Thats why we shant grow old—we shant come to an end. But you cant do it if you dont do it then. A great man, Roger. He made things transcendent—showed them lifted up. He was at Yattendon—oh that was the greatest time of my life: & then there was the Aholibah; & then the Easter at Corfe: Lytton, Henry & I at one Inn; Ray Elly &—at another. Lytton had the mumps. Ottoline came down & stood beneath his window, & he leant out & they blew each other kisses. She used to take the stiles in one stride. “Such long legs” said Lytton “She cant be a woman”. Henry was his most serious love affair. Senhouse is a very nice young man—nice looking, nice manners—but no character, nothing. No Mary [Hutchinson] was rude to Inez; cut her in the street, so I cant see her. Its all a question of little Mary, nothing abstract. But I like her—only not that way of life—so absurd—that fun: but I like old Jack’s stories. Well I must go. Thank you, Virginia.”"
1932.01.31,"Having just finished, as I say, the final version as I call it, of my Letter to a young poet, I can take a moments liberty. From the cynical tone of this sentence I see that my finality is not secure. Writing becomes harder & harder. Things I dashed off I now compress & re-state. And for purposes which I need not go into here, I want to use these pages for dialogue for a time. Let me race down the subdued & dulled interview with my mother in law. Oh the heat in that rose pink bed sitting room, with 3 fierce lights on, the tables crowded with flowers; & with cakes, a fire blazing. Mrs W. sitting upright with her feet on a stool on a high straight backed chair: more pink silk cushions behind her: pearl necklaces swinging. I came in late; she was talking about—I forget: had been talking about the girl whom Cecil might have loved: the daughter of a solicitor at Colchester: Oh yes: she had had influenza & gone to a house kept up by funds left by Mr Andrews. And she was reluctant at first—a home you know. But when she got there what was her amazement? All gentlewomen: flowers everywhere; a cupboard with tonics & sweets to take after them; & Georgian silver on the dinner table; & a garden; & a saloon car to take them out; & grounds; & hot milk at eleven, or chocolate; & the wireless, & a page boy coming for orders; & gardeners. Everything you could wish & not a penny to pay for it! Thats so rare—charity that is really thoughtful; charity for educated women with nice feelings who have fallen on bad times. Well Virginia—& whats your news? Oh & there’s Captain Steel: every Christmas he has a card from the Duke of Gloucester: & he now sells Hoovers for £2.10 a week. But what can one do, in these days? One must do what one can. And what is your news, Virginia? Exodus? Dont you know Exodus? I sometimes scold myself that I haven’t read the Bible lately. Deuteronomy? Oh yes—thats about the building of the Temple. I dont say its all true; but what stories to tell children! I shall never forget telling Bella. Of course a first child is always a wonder child. She used to have her dinner with me when she was 2. And she said what a pity it was summer when Eve stole the apple. If it had been winter, there wouldn’t have been an apple. And she said too: I know where gold comes from—that’s in the ground: but where do picture frames come from? We had large gilt picture frames with family portraits in the dining room. (V.) Well why dont you write about your children? Oh no: I couldn’t say all I think about them. And you’re going so soon? But you haven’t hardly come. And you’ll dine with me next week? She came down to the hall, & was I think going into the lounge to talk to some flushed women playing cards."
1932.02.01,"Last night at Roger’s: present; ourselves, Gerald Heard, Igor. Roger rather sunk & aged after influenza. G.H. in full discourse: about the experiment made by the Yorkshireman who married 4 millions, in Devonshire.

H⁠[eard]. Its intensely interesting (all he says becomes dust). I went round the works with him. The Germans send a man all charges paid for a week. But the vats aren’t ready. All the machinery comes from Belgium. They say it’ll be delivered on a certain day: & it is. The English make excuses: always some reason why they cant deliver. He says he can keep his community supplied all except oranges & (perhaps) dates. Give him 3 months & he could supply Plymouth. Wood planting neglected in England. He buys woods ahead—9 acres, 4 acres, here & there: then the fields with stumps—whats to be done? No aboriculture in England….

Helen here captured me with questions, flattering, sub-acid, about my writing. And about Roger: & not seeing us; & Baba. She lies in bed & talks about Leonard: he was with the esquimaux & gnawed the shoes of the wives, & so sent for a puppy—her delirium. All youth is mad, I said …

Heard said something highly well informed about a Satanic picture. He is a lean starting eyed lobster man: a man of the future, without senses. In with Wells, Plunket &c: but essentially a nobody. Duncan feels this strongly. Science running thin as magnesia or quinine in his veins. Story telling about Thrings &c began & feeling his irrelevancy, for he knows all facts & no feelings, has no humour, no richness, only advanced ideas, he left. So the air became riper. Roger talked about games; children; his design for a curtain; & N⁠[essa] & D⁠[uncan] were almost too severely malicious."
1932.02.02,"Conversation piece: Monday Feb. 1st 1932. 5.30 pm.

I am reading Wells’ science of life, & have reached the hen that became a cock or vice versa. Nelly talks at the door. I hear a characteristic slow & heavy stamp. Then a bold tap at the drawing room door. In comes Ethel Smyth in her spotted fur, like an unclipped & rather overgrown woodland wild beast, species indeterminate. She wears, as usual, her 3 cornered Frederick the Great hat, & one of her innumerable relay of tweed coats & skirts. She carries a leather satchel. Before she has sat down she is talking. “Really I think that building of the kind you describe at Rodmell is worse than death. After all one may say of death its natural: but this is a wanton desecration. Why your downs? Oh I know L. wouldn’t agree; but theres my Rupert Gwynne. He said, he pounced like a wolf on the fold the other day when they were talking against landlords—We, & I hope all my family for ever, he said, refuse to sell our land. We think beauty is something to keep. We sacrifice money—Well—Yes I’m exhausted—Two hours injection .. Not tea, no: but vermouth. It wont make me tipsy? Oh I’m worn out (but she looks like a ruddy sea captain or old apple woman.) Now—questions. But I had such a good visit from Eddy. He’s writing a novel to show that the virtues of the aristocracy, in which I firmly believe though L. doesnt—must survive. Why not in his own person then I asked? Be noble magnanimous serene, instead of petty spiteful & egotistical. Oh thats his digestion: I assure you he’s a phenomenon. Musical. How I pity him! forced to live in England with that gift—you dont know the loneliness. Compare the people at [illegible]. They talk of cricket golf: in Berlin, they have their ham & beer & talk of the way the violin plays the G sharp. Eddy has the duties of his position—a very great one: very real duties. He’s a man of the world—L. despises that. I love it. What was I going to say—He played Der Wald. He said nobody knows Ethel Smyth till theyve heard all this. Who made the theme? I did. Well its the pure flower of the romantic movement. And we sat reading our books & he played & played. He has a character of his own—an original point of view. Oh yes I agree. And he has a deep feeling for you. But how could I make anything of Mary Dodge under four years he said? She’d look wild, & hook the salt cellar to her with her silver claw. V. would make something very amusing of it. Does not everybody take a back place once you’ve known V. I asked. Poor Eddy pumped up the necessary affirmation. Oh my dear dont I know it all—(reference to Lytton) those poor Stracheys: & you who care for so few people. But I must catch my train this time. I’m taking care of myself. I’m worn out. Here are the tickets for the lecture tomorrow in case you can come. My dear V. dont freeze me off—I beg of you. No I cant write to you—I’m completely taken up—three treatments a week. Beecham rang up at eleven. He’s going to do the Prison this year. And I wrote to Mrs Snowden—I’m old enough to be your mother. You say…. (these final words were rattled off on the doorstep)."
1932.02.03,"These conversation pieces are artfully contrived to assuage me, about 11.30, after toiling at correcting Donne, who is to introduce the second volume of the Common Reader. I cant go on squeezing my sentences dry of water; & so write here for 20 minutes; then I think read Donne; then finish with a [unidentified ms] novel upon Hamlet, clever, oh yes—novels about Hamlet always are. Then lunch: then—Oh Ottoline this evening. Yet I am so much interested in Donne, or in my views that I cannot begin.

Last night then, at Clive’s. Roger, Nessa, Duncan. Clive in his brown tea cosy with the strap hanging down indecently like a tail between his legs. Roger rather shrunk up. Sherry. Lottie says dinner. Down we go to the lovely gay room with blue & white chairs. The character of Gerald Heard. D. makes a subtle distinction. “No its not that he prevents me from doing my little owl. Its not that I dislike his facts—I can absorb facts from some people. It is that he sets up no relation between himself & me so that I cannot relate his facts to anything.” R.: But he has passion of mind. V.: He is an ascetic. He refused my cigar. R.: Yet he doesn’t disapprove of the senses. D. He sees nothing. Clive: He loves me, but I find him dryer, more juiceless than a banana. He walks down Bond Street with Raymond & says What a wonderful companion Raymond is because he notices the flags. (Van:) “he notices nothing sensual. We live in our senses. He pours forth all those intelligent remarks about the Satanist picture.” Here I saw Clive look at Lytton’s picture. “Dont have it moved. Have it cleaned, by all means, but it looks very nice there. Its the best thing of Lytton. R. And that horrid vulgar picture by Henry is the one people will know him by. Thats rather summary of course (to D.) Vir: But its far the most like. R. I did a portrait of Lytton, writing E. Victorians at Durbins. Vir: I’m a little annoyed that he left all his old books to Senhouse. Clive. And his will? I’ve heard nothing. No, Roger, I dont think you understand. Nothing, humanly speaking, is more unlikely, in fact impossible, than that R⁠[alph]. should go back to Carrington. He opened his heart to me once … D.: Well, I’m fonder of Frances than of any of them; but I think as a human being, she might have behaved differently. I think so. C. But you dont understand, Duncan. She was passionately in love—is still—with R. So when it came to the point—I mustn’t come this week end—one shade of pressure from him—how could she resist it? Lytton’s letters couldn’t be published—they would hurt everybody too much. We protested. Well what about the Nortons? “I’ve just met a youth who has been a bugger since the age of puberty?” Vir: Oh buggery’s exploded—nobody could mind that now.

Wells on life: facts: Roger & I love to have facts poured over us. Clive only likes facts if they are related to something human. A great many small vegetables, handed by Lottie. The ice too hard.

So we went upstairs & then we said—that France was combining against Japan. L. gave his views on the subject of war with China & Japan. We said that war is the dullest of all things. Not naval war, said Duncan. He had a cousin Admiral Arbuthnot, who lost all his ships. That was exciting. Only for ten minutes, I said. Roger said could we not get up a society of artists to protest against the protection of works of art. Meninsky is ill & has sent the hat round. There is no public fund for helping painters—only writers. What about William Jowitt said Clive, rubbing his hands. Thats a good joke—Poor William’s off to the West Indies. I’m glad morality is vindicated, I said. No, I dont think politics ought to be a matter of Oxford & Cambridge, said Roger. Thats what I wrote & told him when the row was on, said Clive. Lesley liked it—she liked dressing up & being at Court. It was she who forced him to it—telephoning from the basement among the black beetles, I said. Good Earth is a wonderful book, Roger said. It has a quality of objectivity & calm; a new kind of beauty, though the woman’s name is Pearl Buck & she’s an American. Baron Corvo is a good writer said Clive. Once when I was editing the Athenaeum he wrote & said he cdn’t get absolution & though not destitute required more money in order to write. He had my entire sympathy.

Roger went early; stopping his car by the pillarbox, venturously; twice he left the room to see if it were stolen. So to stories of Julian, the war game, Quentin’s love affair, & so all talking we parted, Clive to be away in Rome for two months."
1932.02.04,"One of the curious things I am now proving—now that I am going through the stages of Lytton’s death—is that for us fame has no existence. We say we cant publish Lytton’s letters for 50 years, if at all. We can’t write about him. He has no funeral. I dont know where his ashes are buried. There is no commemoration any more, except when we meet & talk; or in the usual ways, alone at night, walking along the streets (but these states in my case have yet to be verified: all sensation now: I mean what Lytton’s death means I dont yet know). Hence to think of fame is superfluous: what people will say when I’m dead. The solid statue that father left—that exists no longer.

Talk yesterday with Ottoline. Philip discovered in the dining room, with its yellow cloth, reddish shades, reading letters & eating scones. Ott out—selling Lawrence first editions (how I’d like to tell that to Lytton!) We discussed Dryden: P. said he can do nothing but read poetry, gets into an exalted state. I had been buying Dryden for Julian. Talk of celebrated passages. In came Ott: she had toast & tea. Talk of Bertie’s autobiography, private: he devotes a chapter to abuse of her. Katherine Mansfield had disillusioned him. “I heard them discussing me all night through the floor.” She uses too much scent & powder. She had meant nothing to him. “This he sends me—I could only write back Et tu Brute?”—I’ve had Lawrence, Aldous, Cannan, Osbert—now Bertie. He replied he was astonished I should mind, but that he always hurts those he loves … So to the yellow drawing room. So to Lytton: his charm, long thin fingers, “time I knew him about 1908, with Henry [Lamb] … But no letters could be published. He was so considerate. I wrote to him last summer—he answered with great affection, about the past. One could always count on that, though one never saw him much. I’ve asked James to send back my letters. Sprott told me he had read them—I dont want them to be handed round. And do you think he was happy? with Carrington? with Senhouse?”

So to Tom & Vivienne [Eliot] & the dog that makes messes: to Molly [MacCarthy] & her deafness; to The Waves—Jinny made me think of Mary—& Rhoda made me cry with a vision of you. But how could you write that book? the strain, the intensity—at which I kindle, as always, & say I will give her Johnson’s Lives of the Poets. And she says she is reading Eth Bowen who tries to write like me, & will L. come & meet Hodgson who breeds bull dogs; & I say I am an aristocrat in writing; & she confirms this & abuses Vita for writing about Knole, being ignobly conscious of noble blood, & I praise Vita—denounce her novels; & Philip ‘works’ next door; & there is Ott’s pug like a small Chinese lion on the chair in the hall; & Philip pops out with a copy of Dryden’s poems in double columns, & I think how I would describe this to Lytton, & so home, embraced, loved perhaps—anyhow here’s a letter this morning to ask me to think well of her when she’s dead. & to send her The Waves."
1932.02.08,"Why did I ever say I would produce another volume of Common Reader? It will take me week after week, month after month. However a year spent—save for diversions in Greece & Russia—in reading through English literature will no doubt do good to my fictitious brain. Rest it anyhow. One day, all of a rush, fiction will burst in. These remarks are jotted down at the end of a long mornings work on Donne, which will have to be done again, & is it worth the doing? I wake in the night with the sense of being in an empty hall: Lytton dead, & those factories building. What is the point of it—life, when I am not working, suddenly becomes thin, indifferent. Lytton is dead, & nothing definite to mark it. Also they write flimsy articles about him. Jack Squire for instance—as if he had not mattered very much.

And we go on—at Rodmell for the week end; & went over to Caburn, & walked among those primeval downs, like a Heal bed, L. said, so comfortable: bowl shaped shadows; half circles; curves; a deep valley. Quentin last night: how mature, in some way; speaking with deliberation. Calmly explaining his situation with John. All Nessa’s sense, & Clive’s shrewdness. Suddenly he asks in his drawling childish voice for books upon Italian history, for some account of some armament deal; for he is notably objective, interested in politics, in behaviourism, in psychoanalysis. This was what our talk was of. And Benita, he says, is too much afraid of me to send me her memoirs. Some reproach implied—unless this is merely the result of “Mrs Woolf’s palpitating sensibility unmatched since Sterne”—a phrase from an article on music in the M. Guardian, rather tickling my vanity."
1932.02.11,"My mind is set running upon A Knock on the Door (whats its name?) owing largely to reading ‘Wells on Woman’—how she must be ancillary & decorative in the world of the future, because she has been tried, in 10 years, & has not proved anything. So in this mood I record Mary’s telling me last night how she loved cigars; but Jack refuses to let her smoke them—against his idea of what his wife should do—silly affectation—or to let her dress in a dress cut low at the back. Cant go out with you in that frock. Go & put on another. Its indecent—yet will praise Diana [Cooper] for wearing the same. “I threw everything out of the window once” she said. “He treats us—Barbara & me—as if we were tame leopards—pets belonging to him”. As indeed they do, since neither has a penny except of Jack’s earning & giving. She burst into tears, about Lytton: her best, her most intimate friend—“And now I live merely with barbarians. I have nobody to talk to. Lytton came every week. He told me about all his boys. He sat sobbing bitterly, when Roger [Senhouse] was cruel to him. Oh he loved him—just loved him—Thats what I couldn’t understand, & you could, I said. And he was so brilliant, so alive, last winter. I went to him about a fortnight before he was ill. I was in an ecstasy. I said You’re wonderful, wonderful—He was so vigorous, giving a party to five young men. We stood in the hall. There was a letter from one of them refusing to come. And he kissed me. He was so sweet. He would come in. There was the coat he wore. He would talk of everything; tell me everything. And all the time there was this growth in him; & here Virginia & Mary sit talking of him & he’s dead. I cant believe it”"
1932.02.13,"I break off from my plain duty which is to read the Anatomy of the World, to record Roger’s lecture: last night. Roger rather cadaverous in white waistcoat. A vast sheet. Pictures passing. He takes his stick. Gets into trouble with the lanternist. Is completely at his ease. Elucidates unravels with fascinating ease & subtlety this quality & that: investigates (with his stick) opposing diagonals: emphasises the immediate & instantaneous in French art. Here a Queen about to fling out her fingers: here a mother “turning to look at something & losing herself in pensive & tender reverie, while her child struggles to look the other way, & she restrains it, unconsciously, with perfect ease & control.” In the interval we talked to Mary, about the affair of Potocki which is filling our house, & making ring our telephone. (This man is sentenced to 6 months prison because he submitted for private publication the MS of a poem dedicated to John Penis in the Mount of Venus, to pay for which effusion Leonard has committed himself to find £20). Up drifted Nessa & Duncan & Raymond in a tiger sweater; & so back to more lecture; & so home, through icy streets—winter is on us—I write with both sides of my fire on, & my winter jersey—so to Nessa’s, where the stove was kindled, & there was hot soup & cold meat, & coffee & biscuits—all with the usual skill & organising capacity. There we laughed & exaggerated: about the lecture; about Bob & his outburst—‘I cant stay in your house—I must leave, if you impute such motives to my friend—he’s dying—a better socialist than you are—I am appalled at the meanness of human nature. Heres Allen, the wisest political thinker of our time—& you’ve nothing but abuse of him for taking a peerage. It dont matter of course—he’ll kill himself—he’ll be dead by next year. No I oughtn’t to say this—I’m sorry I lost my temper. I apologise’ (eating muffins; seizing the teapot, like some shaggy, surly, unkempt old animal—And then we had to give him a lift to Chelsea ..)

And we talked about a new life of Jesus, which offers two proofs of his existence—witness Roger’s intellectual vitality after speaking to the Queen’s Hall for 2 hours—really excited about the reality of Jesus. Quentin quoted French with a nice accent. Duncan had bought a pine apple with the extra 25/ I paid on his money for the screen—that now lights up the drawing room. I brought it home on Thursday. Bob never noticed."
1932.02.16,"And I have just ‘finished’ I use inverted commas ironically, my Donne, a great but I think well intentioned grind. And I’m fuming, slightly, over Nelly’s typical servant meanness. After you said you didn’t want Lottie hanging about here,—but I didnt say that Nelly—Oh we thought thats what you meant—not very nice to hang about—you said you wouldn’t have her doing that—of course I told her she must take a place at once: she’s gone to the lady at Victoria—this to revenge themselves on me: to make me feel uncomfortable. But I promptly lost my temper, a great relief, & told Nelly that this is the last time I help Lottie or interest myself in their affairs—whereupon she cringes & withdraws, & says she meant nothing. Then Miss McAfee has rejected my article on Skinner, & asks for one on Q. Elizabeth instead, which she shant get; then I have to dine with Ethel Sands tonight, & must go to Bradleys to try on; & must have my hair curled. And I’m quivering & itching to write my—whats it to be called?—“Men are like that?”—no thats too patently feminist: the sequel then, for which I have collected enough powder to blow up St Pauls. It is to have 4 pictures. And I must go on with the C. Reader—for one thing, by way of proving my credentials. To sit to Nessa; gay & debonair; to tie up parcels; to the Busch Quartet where I met Elena R. & reflected upon the transiency of human beauty, passion, & illusion; & so up to lunch."
1932.02.26,"Now I have ‘finished’ the Arcadia, & have 25 minutes in which I ought to correct my Letter to a Young Poet & give it to John. John is fractious & irritable, said to be the effect of love. And what a mint of people I’ve seen; dining with Ethel, having Desmond & Lord David & Ottoline & the Keynes’, & going to Monks House—so march-white & lovely, the fields, & the river where the man caught a large sea trout, trout die if you draw blood, he said, speaking very slowly, wind bitten, that bitter cold day: & then I saw—oh the Keynes—yes—they say Julian’s dissertation is no good, quite uneducated—& talked of Lytton, & how Maynard thought we really carried unconvention too far—no service, no farewell. When Ramsey died his friends went to Golders Green & the coffin was carried through them. But with Lytton there was no mark to say This is over. And he met Senhouse a fortnight later & was the first to tell him that Lytton had left him his books.

Then I’ve not seen Ethel this 2 weeks, because of the rush; & today Sibyl & Hugh & Eth Williamson all come, knocking on each others heels to tea; & we go to the Camargo on Sunday; & must go in to the Woolf 50 birthday—this will happen yearly now⁠[—]⁠after dinner tonight. And to the French pictures.

And Ka shut me in the middle class bedroom effectively last night—so condescending, so self approving, with her docile stories of respectable lunches with the Cornish aristocracy & Mrs Leverton Harris. Who is Mrs L.H.? “Oh dont you know—she signs letters on George Moore’s 80th birthday. And I do hope you will do more Common readers. I prefer them to ——” This little bit of patronage annoyed me more than it should. The day Ka came too we sold the ten thousandth copy of The Waves: which thus beats all my novels, unexpectedly."
1932.02.29,"And this morning I opened a letter; & it was from ‘yours very sincerely J. J. Thompson”—the Master of Trinity; & it was to say that the council have decided to ask me to deliver the Ford Clark Lectures next year. Six of them. This, I suppose, is the first time a woman has been asked; & so it is a great honour—think of me, the uneducated child reading books in my room at 22 H.P.G.—now advanced to this glory. But I shall refuse: because how could I write 6 lectures, to be delivered in full term, without giving up a year to criticism; without becoming a functionary; without sealing my lips when it comes to tilting at Universities; without putting off my Knock at the Door; without perhaps shelving another novel. But I am rather inclined to smile, as I lunch with Miss Dodge today, & she gives me a book with Donne’s autograph; as I buy a pair of shoes at Babers; as I sit down dutifully to correct an article for the Common Reader. Yes; all that reading, I say, has borne this odd fruit. And I am pleased; & still more pleased that I wont do it; & like to think that father would have blushed with pleasure could I have told him 30 years ago, that his daughter—my poor little Ginny—was to be asked to succeed him: the sort of compliment he would have liked."
1932.03.03,"And now, Thursday 3rd March, I am rather upset because the devil whispered, all of a sudden, that I have six lectures written in Phases of Fiction; & could furbish them up & deliver the Clark lectures, & win the esteem of my sex, with a few weeks work. True, L. says since the middle 4 were published in America I could not do this without complete rewriting; & I ought therefore to dismiss the whole thing. Yet, such is the perversity of my mind, I can now think of nothing else; my mind is swarming with ideas for lectures; things I can only say in lectures; & my refusal seems lazy & cowardly. Yet two days ago I was repugnant to the thought: longed only for freedom in which to write a tap at the door; & was convinced that I should be a time serving pot hunter if I accepted. I’ve no doubt the fizz will subside—still what should I do if some friendly fellow of Trinity asked me to think it over? Soberly, I know that if I sat down to rewrite Phases of Fiction it would mean complete immersal for some weeks: I should have to re-cast, re-read: I should be impregnated with the lecturing manner: its jocosity, its emphasis; then I should be jaded by the time I approached a tap; & when I had done A tap, I should be 2 or 3 years distant from The Waves. Anyhow, I’m thankful that I wrote decidedly in the mood I was then in, before the devil whispered, & I went to my drawer & found that old MS; so well written, so full of thought—all the work done for me. The sensible thing to do would be to talk it over quietly next week end with Dadie. Moreover, L. is definitely against it. But then Nessa & Alice Ritchie were instinctively in favour."
1932.03.08,"Oh but I am too tired to write this morning—cant finish my Dorothy Osborne, all because of the Polish Count & Court yesterday."
1932.03.10,"And the peaches were bad last night.

And we had Roger Jack & Mary to dine. And they said the saddle was raw, but it wasn’t.

And oh dear I had lunched with Raymond to meet Mrs Keppel; a swarthy thick set raddled direct (My dear, she calls one) old grasper: whose fists have been in the money bags these 50 years: but with boldness: told us how her friends used to steal, in country houses in the time of Ed. 7th. One woman purloined any jewelled bag left lying. And she has a flat in the Ritz; old furniture; &c. I liked her, on the surface. I mean the extensive, jolly, brazen surface of the old courtezan; who has lost all bloom; & acquired a kind of cordiality, humour, directness instead. No sensibilities as far as I could see; nor snobberies: immense superficial knowledge, & going off to Berlin to hear Hitler speak. Shabby under dress: magnificent furs: great pearls: a Rolls Royce waiting—going off to visit my old friend the tailor; & so on—But I’m fuddled with talk, & we’re starting for Ham Spray to talk to Carrington—dear, dear—a lovely day though.

Oh & Eddy says The Waves is a failure: a miss. Eddy pushed his way in; & I liked him for pushing, once I had done hating him. How formidable I must be."
1932.03.12,"So we went to Ham Spray—a lovely bright day, & got there at 1.30. “I thought you weren’t coming” said C. She came to the door, in her little jacket & socks with a twisted necklace. Her eyes were very pale. “I sent a telegram; but I do everything wrong. I thought you didn’t get it”. She was pale, small, suffering silently, very calm. She had hot soup for us. I looked at the trees. We sat in the cold dining room. I didnt light the fire, she said. She had cooked us a nice hot lunch, succulent, with her own hands. We talked of Mary & Lytton. She had discovered whom Mary loves, owing to an indiscretion. But Lytton made her swear not to tell. So she didn’t. We talked with effort; did she want us? Did she resent our coming to spy on her? She was bitter, laughing at Barbara [Bagenal]. “She asked how she could help. I told her to cut sandwiches. But she took an hour, talking to Tommy.” Then we sat on the verandah. We asked her to make us woodcuts for notepaper. And to do designs for Julia’s book. We tried to gossip—about Mrs Keppel: about Saxon; she laughed once or twice: & her eyes seemed to get bluer. Then it got cold & we went & sat in Lytton’s study—all beautifully neat, his notepaper laid out—a great fire; all his books exactly fitting the shelves, with the letters over them. We sat on the floor round the fire. Then L. suggested a walk. She took us to her grove. She said the trees had a flower wh. smelt very sweet in summer. She said she had some notes to write & would we go by ourselves. We only walked to the bottom of the long low down. Then L. went to do the car, & I wandered in the garden & then back into the sitting room. I was taking out a book when C. came in & asked if we would have tea before we went. She had made it. She & I went upstairs, arm in arm; & I said Let me see the view from the window. We stood looking out—She said Dont you think one ought to keep a room exactly as it was? We went to Dorothy Wordsworth’s house. Her room has been kept exactly as she left it. There are even the same prints & little things on the table. I want to keep Lytton’s rooms as he had them. But the Stracheys say this is morbid. Am I romantic about it d’you think? Oh no, I’m romantic too, I said. And we went back to L.’s sitting room. She burst into tears, & I took her in my arms. She sobbed, & said she had always been a failure. “There is nothing left for me to do. I did everything for Lytton. But I’ve failed in everything else. People say he was very selfish to me. But he gave me everything. I was devoted to my father. I hated my mother. Lytton was like a father to me. He taught me everything I know. He read poetry & French to me.” I did not want to lie to her—I could not pretend that there was not truth in what she said. I said life seemed to me sometimes hopeless, useless, when I woke in the night & thought of Lytton’s death. I held her hands. Her wrists seemed very small. She seemed helpless, deserted, like some small animal left. She was very gentle; sometimes laughing; kissing me; saying Lytton had loved his old friendls best. She said he had been silly with young men. But that was only on the top. She had been angry that they had not understood how great he was. I said I had always known that. And she said I made too much of his young friends. She said Roger was “as Lytton said, very dim in the intellect.” He could never have a real intimacy—it wasn’t sharing everything—only Roger was very high spirited & liked going to Rome, & rather liked Lytton reading aloud to him—but they couldn’t talk. And this last year Lytton made up his mind to be middle aged. He was a realist. He faced the fact that Roger could not be his love. And we were going to Malaga & then he was going to write about Shakespeare. And he was going to write his memoirs, which would take him ten years. It was ironical, his dying, wasnt it. He thought he was getting better. He said things like Lear when he was ill. I wanted to take you to see him the day you came, but I was afraid to—James & Pippa said one must not run any risk, & it might have upset him. “No, of course not” I said. “Roger will take the books of course—he will have to.” And what else did we say? There was not much time. We had tea & broken biscuits. She stood by the fireplace. Then we said we must go. She was very quiet & showed no desire for us to stay.

Then, as we were leaving the room to go she suddenly picked up a little French box with a picture of the Arc de Triomphe upon it & said “I gave this to Lytton. Take it. James says I mustnt give away Lytton’s things. But this is all right. I gave it him.” So I took it. There is a coin in it. How frightened she seemed of doing wrong—like a child who has been scolded.

She came down into the front of the house. She kissed me several times. I said “Then you will come & see us next week—or not—just as you like?” “Yes, I will come, or not” she said. And kissed me again, & said Goodbye. Then she went in; & turned & I waved & she waved back & she went into the house. Next morning at 8.30 the gardener heard a noise in her bedroom. He went in & found she had shot herself through the thigh. She died in 3 hours. She was conscious when Ralph & Alix & Bunny came.

(She also took me into Lytton’s bedroom. I saw his great bed; & the Anrep mosaic; his cupboard & things.)"
1932.03.17,"So Carrington killed herself; & again what L. calls “these mausoleum talks” begin again. We were the last to talk to her, & thus might have been summoned to the inquest; but they brought it in an accident. She maintained this, even to Ralph. Her foot slipped as she was shooting a rabbit.

And we discuss suicide; & I feel, as always, ghosts (dwindling) changing. Lytton’s affected by this act. I sometimes dislike him for it. He absorbed her⁠[,] made her kill herself. Then the romantic completeness which affects Mary, ‘a beautiful gesture—her life & her death’. Nonsense says Leonard: it was histrionic: the real thing is that we shall never see Lytton again. This is unreal. So we discuss suicide, and the ghosts as I say, change so oddly in my mind; like people who live, & are changed by what one hears of them. Now we have to see Pippa, & James & Alix. Then to Rodmell: then—perhaps—to Greece with Roger & Ha. A venture that would be: & I think we’re both in the mood for ventures after this morbid time; so much talk of death; & there death is of course.

We went from Cambridge on Saturday to Kings Lynn; through the lovely lonely coast that lies between that & Cromer, where I intend to go again: green meadows against the sea; & trees, & complete solitude, & now & then a line of little old houses: & Stiffkey with its hall; & some village spread out, as in a mediaeval picture, upon the rise of a dune; & lovely stubborn unknown place names; & wild roads; & Blickling, Holt, & Coke of Norfolk & Houghton; & the Pastons—all this jumble somehow shadowed by Carrington’s death: the name Partridge of course appearing on tombs & grocers’ shops."
1932.03.18,"Last night at William Plomer’s: talk, talk talk. Let me try to remember: on cooking: breadmaking; peaches rotten; Glaspells: going over the house; Tony’s studio; Tony bald, innocent, blue eyed & slow stumbling; William compact & robust. An eye for furniture. Tony’s tables, beds & sofas, in the Empire style. Gas fire. Talk of The Fountain. Oh & Tony’s fathers first wife died of apoplexy in C⁠[onstantino]⁠ple, through running to catch the boat on a hot day, a very fat woman. Mary Butts. “I cannot say anything of my sister—She is a bad woman—pretentious—I can see no merit in her books—pretentious. She corrupts young men. They are always committing suicide. She now has married Gabriel Atkins—without any character. They were given 25 decanters for their wedding.” Tony is ashamed of Mary, who thus defiles the Butts blood. In came Louise Morgan, the interviewer, nerve drawn, lined, crimson, agile; & Mrs Paul Robeson, negroid, vivacious, supple, talking like a woman on the stage: chiefly to L. about negroes. And Janin, who admires my books, & has a friend who wants to translate; a thin skinned Frog all gesture & wrinkle; a coffee merchant ex diplomat; despises society; stories of Colefax, French Embassy. The Duke of Vendome—“Que c’est mélée, mon monde!” Talk, talk, talk. And cold; & a glass of green water; & so home to bed. William rather pompous, ceremonious, & considerate.

Tea with Nessa, Julian & Mrs Ramsey: the dissertation: Nessa wishes him to give it up. Robustly [?] satisfied with him whatever he does. How dull this is to me—who like faults. Talk of Carrington: how long shall we talk of Carrington? Dispute as to how she got her gun. Mary’s story of the 3 rabbits on the lawn."
1932.03.24,"I am not sure of the precise day, save that it is Thursday & tomorrow is Good Friday & therefore we are at Rodmell on the loveliest spring day: soft: a blue veil in the air torn by birds voices. I am glad to be alive & sorry for the dead: cant think why Carrington killed herself & put an end to all this. True, they are building the vast elephant grey sheds at Asheham, but I intend to see them as Greek temples; & Percy says they are building 60 cottages—but we wait to see if this is so. And the country is lovelier & lovelier; more friendly, charming, brilliant, still with great empty spaces, where I want to walk, alone, & come to terms with my own head. Another book? What? Merciful to be free, entirely to think this out; needn’t write a line I dont want to, or squander a moment on repetition. Two books on Virginia Woolf have just appeared—in France & Germany. This is a danger signal. I must not settle into a figure.

Perhaps we are becoming more sociable. Mrs Hawkesford wants to bring her daughter to tea. I think we shall go to Greece with Roger & Margery. And—well, we go to tea with M. Baring on Monday.

I’m drowsing in this heat & quiet. Cant correct any more C.R. articles; nor write letters; yet it isn’t lunch time yet. And there’s the paper to read. Odd that Lytton didn’t write more. Which life should one lead—the life one likes. I like writing. I like change. I like to toss my mind up & watch to see where it’ll fall. Nessa off to Cassis. Clive coming back. Then the London Season: then here again. A happy life. But encompassed by solitude—human life I mean. Miss Bowen, stammering, shy, conventional, to tea [on 18 March]."
1932.03.25,"Such is the atmosphere of days, that I thought this was Sunday, because it is Good Friday. The weather is Sunday weather—divinely good, warm, unclouded—Oh how lovely my view would be if it weren’t for the grey galvanised sheds—how am I to absorb them into the view? And I want to write a little story, before I go into Good Friday goose. I’m tired of my own criticism—But isn’t it futile to get away into that life—where all the proportions are different—when I still have Lord knows how many brilliant articles—all cut out rounded, coloured, like magic lantern slides, to correct? An odd gulf between the one world & the other. I think I’ll go into the house & fetch my de Quincey who comes next. I am sober & desultory, cant string all my ideas on one thread. Leonard is in a pickle with Wells, & cant get hold of the facts with which to confute him. On the other hand, the dogs are thinking more & barking less, the result of my letter. One poor beast is they say ‘taped’—has his mouth—sealed: not altogether: barking again. A good walk might be wholesome. Percy steals the anthracite, & says didn’t we hear Pinka barking all one night—a rustic attempt at mystification which fails to convince. Why is there always this relationship between master & servant?—Maynard says its the same in offices. Always deceit & distrust. Our Transition Age, perhaps. Perhaps we go to Sissinghurst tomorrow: there are 2 people with their house for life."
1932.03.29,"We went to Sissinghurst—I’m so tired with correcting Dr Burney that I must run my pen here—& it was a fine goose grey morning. Odd the merging of Sussex into Kent. The sloping hop oasts do it, I think: then the little sunk away villages: what led people to pitch on the 18th century where they did? A tudor house, alone; on the road: why build there? L. notices the way; I these little facts. Harold came out in a torn jacket: Vita in breeches & pink shirt. We went over the grounds. H. said I’m getting nobler & nobler as we get poorer. I’ve refused an offer to write for the American papers. Oh but there are myriads of things to do here. “Yes we want to turn those stables into guest bedrooms: & build a library across the courtyard”, said Vita. All is planned. H. has drawn it in his note book. Walls have been built & turf laid. Lunch in the boys cottage. Talk of Beaverbrook’s party to wh. H. went with Enid Jones—Oh so lovely—the clothes; then to Heinemann: people seemed to have dust scattered on them. Enid became quite upset. How she wants to write, but has to give parties for her husband. And I was sleepy & afraid the Rolls Royce wd. get to the Temple too quick & she’d not have finished her story. But she had finished it. And next day I got a letter to say that she had almost—killed herself? I suggested—no, broken down. She wants to be a writer. Envies the genius of Mrs Belloc Lowndes.

So we ate cold salmon & raspberries & cream & little variegated chocolates given by Lady Sackville, now at their feet, & drank oh lots of drinks; & then climbed Vita’s tower; lovely pink brick; but like Knole, not much view, save of stables that are to be guest rooms. So home. And then a very wet Sunday & a prodigious reading & drowsing—I’ve now carried to perfection the art of sleeping & reading & make up half my book in the wildest way asleep, improvising, & then surprised to wake up & find none of it true.

Yesterday we went to Rottingdean to tea with Maurice (as I’m now to call him.) He & Elizabeth [Williamson] in a long sunny room full of books, tables, plants; rather bad taste; rich; nothing very nice to look at; two sweating dusty footmen brought in innumerable plates. In came Ethel: in grey tweed; & a chinless Cavalry Captain called Grant, who is Peter Davies’ partner: the very spit & image of a soldier in Punch: many peoples ideal, I daresay; so suave, masculine, foolish; exactly a round peg in his hole. All the slang right & the snobbery & the culture & the self-possession. Had killed animals in every part of the East. Talk, of course, wildly detailed & emphatic & useless about Greece. You must see Meleora—where’s the map? You get out of the train—you get a car—no we couldnt—go to Giolman in Athens—oh & dont forget Aegina: you must hire a boat—oh that evening.. &c &c. And then talk about publishing: & I slipped my anchovy sandwich into my bag, & took it out, thinking it was my lighter. Ethel balanced by the fire: told us stories about Empresses: Maurice prompted: laughed at her. “I’ve known him 40 years & he’s always shocked—feels what people feel at the other end of the room. Nice feelings. I haven’t any. I’m going to write a book called The Mole, the Cesspool & Mrs Woolf. You’ve kept my letters you say—Yes she’s a strange woman—loves getting letters—so I write, sheet after sheet. Nothing I like better. I used to keep a diary. Since I knew her, two years ago in February, I’ve written only letters…”

And Mrs Woolf we want you to write a biography for us in 30,000 words. You’d pay a devil £15 to get up the facts for you. Then you’d have nothing to do but dash it down. You’d do it in two months. By way of bargain I’ll offer you the MS of a gardening book. Oh we’ve lost heavily over our expensive books. Dizzy’s edition fills our cellar. I’ve come in to make us less high brow. I want novels. Ideas. Thats whats the fun. Making suggestions to authors—That chinless man to suggest to me. Pah! So home; after seeing M⁠[aurice]’s bedrooms &c. A shy, lobster coloured skinless man; tripping about the room to fetch things. Keeps his house, I think, for his friends. Drinks. Sentimentalises. Would like to be taken seriously."
1932.04.11,"The eddy of travel—wisps & straws—is already whirling round. I have a list of things to buy on my table. We start at 10 on Friday; shall be sailing down the Dalmatian coast this time next week. Embedded as I am in Tavistock Sqre I cant make much play with this. Also it is fiendishly cold, wet, blowing, like last year in France. I like this adventure of Greece all the same; & the fact that we are sociably going with Roger & Margery; & that—intimacy—will be part of our journey. The result of Lytton’s death—this desire to be with friends. I am muddled headed. This perpetual criticism tires my brain. I’ve almost done de Quincey though, & am well on with the book.

As for external facts—it seems likely that our John will not stay. That is he wishes to work half time in order to write. Elizabeth Williamson is a possibility—rain rain—it drums on my skylight. L. is doing Press accounts & it looks as if we should net £2000.

Hail now; & camel coloured sky. I am waiting for lunch. Dear me, I ought to read some hideously obscure poems. Tomorrow we go to Monks House to take Pinka. This is a little girls writing—like a childs letter. I’ve seen the Nicolsons, & Ethel, & Kingsley Martin. Harold up to be looked at for that job. And James & Alix. Lytton left masses of poems & unfinished plays—not much good, James says. And box upon box of letters. Ours still lost. What to do? said James. He said nasty things about everyone. How can they be published? Could one extract a philosophy? He had meant to write one more book for money on Washington & then burn his boats: declare himself & live abroad. Declare what? Everything. His hatred [?] &c. Sex: love: But I doubt it. There was Ham Spray."
1932.04.18,"On board the Tevere, off the coast of Italy. Yes, but I’ve forgotten to get out my ink pot, & thus the splendour of these first words is committed to the gold pen.

My mind—but is this to be a record of ’my mind’—truth is I’ve not thought of a form for this book—shall it have one—or none? I was so knife-splitting, flower expanding that morning at Victoria: I felicitated myself upon being a writer. Whatever I saw was so complex. There was a bride, dressed in the colours of the Union Jack, brand new handbag. And Helen [Anrep], the full blown rose petals dewed with moisture, come to say Good bye: & the Yak that is M⁠[argery Fry]: for she is thick as an oak, & wears a rough white pelt, constrained by a girdle—the Yak said “If you’d brought a dog I should have said Good bye.” I divined antagonism. This has developed only into a pervasive inferiority complex. I’m one of those superior beings, she thinks, who exist by virtue of their white petals; this little nervousness I vanquish by visiting her in her carriage alone, while L. & R. play chess & teach each other Greek. R. is sweet, rich, accommodating, infinitely serious, & rolls out rich Italian commands to the gondoliers, all waiting for foreigners who dont come, for no one travels this year, by the canal, at the end of St Mark’s. We take a gondola for one hour, & so cross to San Giorgio; & see the miraculous apse, & peer; & climb; & smooth our soles on the red yellow rosy pavement, raying out like the sea, with inlaid flowers: & Venetian light is pale & bright: the palaces, says R. pretty frauds, examples of inlay & carpentry. That old fraud Ruskin—we were now in St Mark’s Square, looking at Adam & Eve. There are chapters about that. He was too virtuous, thats a great pity, everything had to be squared—even these finicking palaces must be morally Good—which theyre not—oh no—merely slices of coloured stone. Dinner at the Cavallo—the old one gone bankrupt. Out after the play, in the theatre slung with green glass beads, onto the black tossing water, so silent, so swaying: & the poor people asked us not to overpay the traghetto; & there were cactuses; & a man singing in the morning; & R. & I went to the Tiepolo church; & the thick yellow service with the priests weaving a web in incantation, & the little boys & the reverence & secularity & ancientness made us say This is the magic we want: & magic there must be; so long as magic keeps its place. So on board our spacious orderly well found ship, now passing the coast of Italy."
1932.04.21,"Athens [Hotel Majestic]

Yes, but what can I say about the Parthenon—that my own ghost met me, the girl of 23, with all her life to come: that; & then, this is more compact & splendid & robust than I remembered. The yellow pillars—how shall I say? gathered, grouped, radiating there on the rock, against the most violent sky, with staring ice blue, & then cinder black; crowds flying as if suppliants (really Greek schoolchildren). The Temple like a ship, so vibrant, taut, sailing, though still all these ages. It is larger than I remembered, & better held together. Perhaps I’ve washed off something of the sentimentality of youth, which tends to makes things melancholy. Now I’m 50 (I signed this boldly in the hotel book—the good Yak refrained—another proof of inferiority complex), now I’m grey haired & well through with life I suppose I like the vital, the flourish in the face of death. Then there’s Athens like crumbled egg shells beneath, & the black grey bush tufted hills. “The Germans come out like things hidden in a pocket” I said. Sure enough, when the storm passed over, out they came, honest [?], perspiring unattractive people, claiming, we thought, more of the Acropolis than any other nation. We wandered; Roger said Awfully swell, awfully swell. At the Museum in the morning he said They dont compose. Thats a star fish shape. Look at the thinness of the lines: & no background. There were—& still are—myriads of Greek black & red or red & black pots, each capable of inspiring a volume, & before them trail tired children, tired mothers, the oddest shabbiest raggiest housemaids & clerks, whose whole fortune has been spent on the ticket, & they’ll go home, & dominate some little suburban street on the strength of “I was in Athens in April 1932”: witness the pure white marble bust after Pheidias on the mantlepiece. This is depressing in museums.

I like Athens about 7, when the streets are hurrying clamouring, flitted across by all those black whitefaced women, & shawled women, & dapper little men who come with the bats & the evening primroses in Southern towns, ari lalagos. Margery, listening to the talk at Averrov tonight said the pitch is the same as the English. She is full of reasonable & well instructed remarks—as that Christ is never painted being washed; that the priests are allowed hairpins gratis, since they wear their hair long & might be tempted into effeminate ornament. This was said by the garden where all the flowers were this morning—ranunculus like pink & violet shells many folded; the flapping black white specked irises. The other remark was made in the Byzantine Church at Daphni. “Oh awfully swell—better than I’d any notion of” said Roger depositing his hat stick pochard & two or three guides & dictionaries on a pillar. Then we all stared up at the white vindictive Christ, larger than a nightmare, in blue & white mosaic on the ceiling. We liked that Church very much. It is high & rugged, & arched, & the mosaic is mostly peeled. And one looks out of the door on those tufted green trees which seem each tufted with a sun lit & clouded wave—so bright so dark are the green waves in the wood in which we walked. A Greek family keeps the church—middle-aged men & women, sitting in town clothes (the men) with overcoats & gold rings reading a paper at 3.30. Such idleness, such aimlessness I’ve never seen in England. At last the youngest, a woman, in shawl slippers & cotton dress, strolls off, climbs a ruined wall & begins to pick yellow flowers—nothing else to do. So we drove on down to the sea—& how lovely the pure lip of the sea is touching a wild shore; with hills behind, & green plains, & Eleusis in the distance & green, & red rocks, & one steamer starting."
1932.04.22,"It was bitter cold. That one always forgets. The wind whistled through the uncovered sides of Giolmann’s Hupmobile. L. sneezed: I shivered. All the floor was covered with painting boxes. We lunched on a table in the sun at Suniun—the chalk white pillars set high like a lighthouse. The flowers all in miniature made a bright turf—M. uprooted little irises. What did we say? Nothing much. After a week one talks only at dinner. And then drove home; that is through the plumed trees, by the red shaped fields, with the sudden carpets of deep red poppies, past the gipsies huts, made like wigwams out of pressed ferns; there a girl wandered spinning from a lump of sheeps wool; & women sat at the door—I thought of Piccadilly at this hour. How strange the patiently amenable flat land is, set with biblical trees, grazed by long woolled sheep, & not a house to be seen. This is England in the time of Chaucer. So at Sunium, the sea breaks upon green stone & red stone, & the slate-coloured slanting sailed ships go by—all as in the time of Chaucer or Homer, not a pier, not a parade; no one looking. At Salamis the Greek Army were carrying little sacks of earth to the top of the Tomb of the dead soldiers to make it [word illegible]. A tuft of flowers was on the top. Oh the cold, the cold."
1932.04.24,"Oh the rain, the rain! That was next day at Aegina. That lovely shelving island with the baked narrow path, the sea & the beach, the little pink & yellow houses, the thyme, the steep hillside, the Temple, skeletal, dominant, the bays flowing filled with sea—all this was nothing but chill, mist, rain, Americans clustering round a thin professor; & we cowering under a pine tree which let the rain on us. Even so—Roger said awfully swell; this is superb—a sandstone temple better than Sunium. Marvellous what genius can do in a little space—heres the perfectly moving proportions—& the rain drove us down to our boat as soon as we could. They had caught red fish & octopus. How? Well they put onions, bread & so on down, & the fish settle on them, then they drop a charge & pouf!—it goes up like that, & the fish come to the top dead, & they spear them. Its not allowed. But nobody can see you, round there. Such was the account given by the stoker with the lovely Greek smile—the smile the muleteers have & the taximen. For R. & M. were mounted, & very queer they looked, jolting up the hill—the polie makria [far distant] hill, as the bright faced girl called it. For the people are desperately poor, & come, offering flowers, & are given the remains of lunch.

Today—how happy today was—at the little round Byzantine Church on the slopes of Hymettus. Why cant we live for ever like this, I said to myself, not that it was hot enough; but the rain blew over; & life seemed very free, & full of the good things—wildness, thyme smelling, cypresses, the little courtyard where R. & M. sat absorbed painting; with the great marble white dog asleep in a corner, & the usual frail slippered women padding about in their swallow rooms built upstairs, with old bits of carved marble for the doorposts. I got a handful of wild anemomes & orchids. One drives the dull part & scrambles when the ruts throw us too violently backward & forward.

Talk today about Max Eastman’s book: Roger’s theories of art; & stories. M. tells stories of falling off a horse in Canada; of Julian’s life; of Mrs Masefield—unintimate stories, for she has no foothold among us; & will slip off this rock into her obscure waters when we go back—not that she needs us. She is punctilious about trains, & has a passion for cheese—We start tomorrow early for Nauplia, in a car."
1932.05.02,"Well it is five minutes to ten: but where am I, writing with pen & ink? Not in my studio. In the gorge, or valley, at Delphi, under an olive tree, sitting on dry earth covered with white daisies.. L. is reading his Greek grammar beside me; there goes, I think, a swallow tail. Shelves of grey rock rise opposite me, each set with olive trees, & little bushes, & if I follow up, there comes the huge bald gray & black mountain, & then the perfectly smooth sky. And so back to the hot earth, & the flies sitting in yellow hearts of the daisies. There is a tinkling of goat bells; an old man has ridden off on his mule—we’re right at the bottom of the hill on top of which is Delphi, & Roger & Margery sketching. And a locust has just perched on the olive tree.

Thus I try to make visible this scene which will soon be gone forever. & perhaps too try to avoid that demon which says, perhaps so unnecessarily, that one ought to write down how we went to Corinth, Nauplia, Mycenae, to Mistra to Tripolitza, & so back to Athens, when the sun blazed, & I wore a silk dress, & we went to the gardens, & then started at 7 on Saturday morning for Delphi. I ought to write about all these places, & try perhaps to solidify some of these floating sequences that go through my mind as we drive. For the drives were very long; Oh & the wind & the sun, & how ones lips swelled & blackened & cracked & one’s nose peeled, & one’s cheeks were hot & dry as if sitting unshaded by a hot fire. All vanity has long died out. One is becoming a peasant. This reminds me of the start of joy with which I saw a tolerably well-dressed woman in the Salon at the Hotel Majestic drinking with a voluble old Greek gentleman the afternoon we came back, dry dusty red, gold, black, brown, creased, (M.’s wrinkles are marked like the stripes on the coat of a wild beast). After four or five days of the peasants & their solid draped beauty, the sharpness & subtlety of civilisation excite one’s upper scale of nerves—the violin notes.

Greece then, so to return to Greece, is a land so ancient that it is like wandering in the fields of the moon. Life is receding (in spite of that donkey). The living, these worn down, for ever travelling the roads Greeks, cannot master Greece any longer. It is too bare too stony, precipitous for them. We met them always on the high mountain passes padding along beside their donkeys, so small, existing so painfully, always marching in search of some herb, some root, mastered by the vast distances, unable to do more than dig their heels in in the rock. Such solitude as they must know, under the sun, under the snow, such dependence on themselves to clothe & feed themselves through the splendid summer days is unthinkable in England. The centuries have left no trace. There is no 18th 16th, 15th century all in layers as in England—nothing between them & 300 B.C. 300 B.C. somehow (dominated) conquered Greece & still holds it. So it is the country of the moon; I mean, lit by a dead sun. If one finds a bay it is deserted; so too with the hills & the valleys; not a villa, not a tea shop not a kennel anywhere; no wires, no churches, almost no graveyards.

But to be accurate, Nauplia & Mycenae lie in a rich soft prosperous plain, there are even occasional villages, where we stop & R. & M. get out their paint boxes, because the accent is there right for painting—where there is a house; for there there are aspens & cypresses & roofs to stand against the plains & the mountains.

What then happens (we’ve been a walk still further into the valley which still winds itself deeper & deeper, left leaves to mark the path, coming back lost it, peeled a stick for me & here we are, having shifted, owing to the sun, higher, under the olive tree; & I’ve taken off my shoes for coolness) what then happens is that the villagers come up & begin, like friends, to talk about things in general. Last night on the hill above Delphi in the evening light with Itea beginning to flash & sparkle by the sea, one ship in the bay & the snow mountains standing out in the background, & the foreground still running rich green & red brown, where the goats & sheep were grazing, & the cars passing slowly on the winding road beneath, last night as we sat there, the goat girl came bounding up as if to rick her sheep, but it was only to talk to us. No slinking past, no tittering, no shyness. She stopped before us, as a matter of course. M. made her look through her glasses, first the right way, then the wrong. Then she told us words for things. Skotos her rough thick coat, ourands the sky, a flower lullulin (?) [luludi] my watch orologe [orologiou], the car—I’ve forgotten. She shouted with laughter. She was small brown, will make a shrewd broad old woman; unconstrained, friendly. Her brother came, 18, quick, shrewd, small eyed. I took his stick & water bottle. Then there was the difficulty about the coins. First she wouldn’t take them or M.’s handkerchief: then followed us, putting her hand on her chest, asking complaining, but about what? L. repeated his gift. She took it. But not with joy. And the boy brought us a great saucepan of yaot [yoghurt]. & so home, with the electric lights coming out; & they danced after dinner in the public house, young men, punctiliously, bowing & twisting & keeping their feet on the right spot, dressed in trousers & shirts.

halfway up. It occurs to me that the ridge seen from the top is like a badly peeled pear, when lines of peel are left on the edges.

Also that Lawrence writes his books as I write this diary in gulps & jerks: & has not the strength to come down in one blow: no welding, no shaping—the result of a false anti-literariness perhaps.

Also that the male virtues are never for themselves, but to be paid for. This introduces another element into their psychology—to be paid for: what will pay. This can be sublimated but the alloy remains. (I’m thinking of the book again)"
1932.05.08,"Here it is, the last evening; very hot, very dusty. The loudspeaker is braying; L. reading, not with sympathy, Ethel Smyth; it is 2 minutes to 7 & therefore I have about 30 minutes in which to fill this book. I’ve only used 10 of my 100 nibs: my ink is still deep; how many white pages remain. This is the result of the best holiday these many years. It was so nice going off to the Post Office after our plain roll & honey; & it was so hot, & then there was always something doing. (I dont like Sundays, not even here: the little yellow cardboard looking boys are now drumming, & the dogs barking).

We went to Aegina [on 6 May]: sun & blue gradually rolling up the mist; & L. & I found a desert bay lapped by water pale & pure—no—not pale—but pure as some liquid jelly, laid quivering over stones, & shells, & anemones. L. went staggering out across the stones & flung himself in; I paddled. My bare feet burnt on the sand. I dried them by letting them burn a minute. And this was virgin sea. The island looked from the Temple like a south sea island with naked natives gathering to see the boats come in. M.—whose humanity grows & waxes, or perhaps is allowed fuller expression, became sad by the number of donkeys provided, & we only took two. Here the girls [?] pulled my hands—Ride ride they kept saying, very hot, very steep. So we pretended to shiver—said riding was too cold. And the children came pressing irises & yellow poppies.

Even so, I shant fill my book—even by writing so quickly. I’ve scarcely read either—only Roger’s Eastman, & Wells, & Murry. Oh but I’ve thought too much, about my little book. The truth is this sight seeing, this sitting, as we’ve just sat, in the [Zappeion] garden & watching the whiskered maniac against the wall laughing, as if his insanity were merely too much ripeness, & the woman with gold teeth, & the love struck boy who ate a chocolate cake, while M. painfully commiserates the poverty of the Greeks, who look anxious, she says, & the hotel keeper she says has consumption—Couldnt she give the bootblack our toast—oh yes, she cant resist the little boy with a roll of peppermints—this is her suppressed, half Quaker, half virgin attitude to the world—as I was saying while I watch all this, & wonder what the hectic lady with rouged cheeks is laughing at—is it my straw hat trimmed of half its brim last night, or can it be Roger’s paintboxes with which he’s painfully slung—as I meditate such important events, as they slip & slide & catch on the surface of my mind, I’m subterraneously sunk in scenes for my little book: make up arguments, see pictures, keep dropping something new into the cauldron, which must bubble as richly as possible before its poured & stilled & hardened—as I do this, & accept whatever suggestion the shaking cypresses & aspens, the orange flower smell, the man selling penny toys of monkeys on sticks offer me, time passes: I’m not sure if I’m in Greece or London: but think it more likely I’m in Greece, happy, easy, friendly with everything swimming easily forward. L. discussing prison reform with Marjorie, informing Roger about the break up of the atom. And then behold we come to a stop before an aviary. L. picks a tassel of grass; & the budgerigars find it & peck it to bits. On we loaf again. Its odd why khaki is used I say: & R. says thats how they see the country; then we watch a mediæval soldier in white leggings, & tufted shoes, & kilt. R. has been painting in the Parthenon, hadn’t liked to ask him to sit. We spent 3 hours a day eating says M. M. wants to give away our food says L. & Roger runs across the road for it. These are our jokes: kindly sensitive jokes. M. is still conscious of inferiority, likes to talk of her parents & to palliate R.’s severity. Would like to begin life again, I think. What is lack of charm? I ask myself. Why dont these good qualities cut more ice? And whats just [?] untied the bunch in her so that shes ineffective? Yet has every art at command; can compell yaot to breed in her house; travels; sketches; has sympathy far more widely than I have for beggars, children, state of the people. But not charm.

Then I had the vision, in Aegina, of an uncivilised, hot new season to be brought into our lives—how yearly we shall come here, with a tent, escaping England, & sloughing the respectable skin; & all the tightness & formality of London; & fame, & wealth; & go back & become irresponsible, livers, existing on bread yaot, butter, eggs, say in Crete. This is to some extent a genuine impulse, I thought, coming down the hill with easy strides; London is not enough, nor Sussex either. One wants to be sunbaked, & taken back to these loquacious friendly people, simply to live, to talk, not to read & write. And then I looked up & saw the mountains across the bay, knife shaped, coloured, & the sea, brimming smooth; & felt as if a knife had scraped some incrusted organ in me, for I could not find anything lacking in that agile, athletic beauty, steeped in colour, so that it was not cold, perfectly free from vulgarity, yet; old in human life, so that every inch has its wild flower that might grow in an English garden, & the peasants are gentle people; & their clothes, worn & burnt, are subtly coloured, though coarse. Now there are sympathies between people & places, as between human beings. And I could love Greece, as an old woman, so I think, as I once loved Cornwall, as a child.

For this reason then, that we shall come back, & because L. wants to go to dinner, & I think there is a hair in my pen, I doubt that I shall make any more ceremony about coming to an end—‘Now get ready & dont talk so much—’ I must end.

Still the last night, & L. playing chess still with Roger, & I’ve lain in one of those interesting torpors on my bed, with Lawrence to read, & have now woken & cant but try to fix these last minutes for L. will be in then—if I can. The Greeks, who dont dine till 9, are now at it—that is are chattering, hooting, driving in the street. I hear them though our window opens on the back.

It is a fine still night. Now & then a few single words become audible. The top half of a building is cadaverous. Now the loudspeaker begins, & will so reel hoarsely through a few bars, & then suddenly stop. Everything rattles & jerks as if it were a jingling ill jointed but rapid cart.

So the days in Athens will get hotter & hotter—tonight they were dining on the pavement at Costis—& the nights will get noisier & gayer. I forgot to write about the Parthenon yesterday—all a glare—an oblong of blue sky made oblong by white pillars—the compact rush of the Parthenon—a slip of shade along the Erechtheum, in which we sat. And a loose lipped good tempered blue eyed man lounged up & said might he look at L.’s stick (the ringed one, bought at Sparta). So he picked at it & we said it was Greek, & he said no. It was a banana cane from Canada—had never been made in Greece. From that he went on to talk about Greek peasants. To see how they live would make you cry he said. Always working & nothing to eat but black bread so hard you cant cut it, (this with excruciated gestures) & perhaps they make a little cheese & come & sell it but there is plenty of wine always. So to the war. Everything has been wrong since then. Before the pound was stable & so was the drachma. Now one day theyre up: another down. What does sugar cost by the kilo in England? A kilo is 3 lbs: well, its cheaper in Greece. The Government protect it. But anything that comes from abroad is dear—shoes, clothes. And we make hardly any flour. All this in tortured French, with the young French officer sitting beside us & his wife & sister reading a guide book. A French battle ship was in the bay, & an Italian, & soon the English would come & the sailors would walk about the town & say they had seen Greece. Indeed here came a guide leading the French sailors. Only French sailors would know the names of pediments & columns, said Roger, always in love with the French. The French would cook this better or do that better. Now the French President has been killed by a White Russian. M. pricks up her ears commiserates & reflects intelligently what effect this will have on politics. So we went to the hill which the driver called Phillipappos [Philopappos], all in one gulp, but it was wired off, & we therefore turned back & went on to the theatre [of Dionysos], with its curved marble seats each cut with the name of a priest seat holder as they stick cards on the boxes at Covent Garden. One, the pawed one, the lion one, was for the priest of Dionysos, & had a carving of goats prancing & vines pendant. Here L. sat & we said that Sophocles Euripides & Aristophanes must have sat here & seen—Anyhow the hills were before them, as before us. And if the 2000 years have laid a few light rubbishy stucco houses on the earth, in the way, very little has been done to damage the view—nothing solid & immense & lasting has been built. Poverty & war & misery have prevented any obliteration—here or elsewhere. Indeed one might ask for more care, & more custody, not less. This afternoon the Greek raggamuffin boys were shying stones at a marble ruined arch, & pitting it, so that in some years it will be irrecoverably damaged. And the graves are nettled, tin-canned, dirty, dissolute, though the Greeks made the tombs with their own hands—no the land is too exhausted even to guard its own interests any longer—no doubt Lord Elgin’s excuse for stealing the statues from the Parthenon & the pillars from the tomb of Agamemnon at Mycenae.

Still L. plays chess & it is nearly twelve. But Athens shows no sign of sleep, so I can’t complain. A howling whistling sound is made by the trams. This time tomorrow we shall be nearing Salonika: I shall be turning on my shelf, L. on his, & so for 3 nights till we reach Rodmell & sleep in our soft beds, in the cool English May:"
1932.05.10,"Only the most hardened scribbler could attempt to write in the Orient Express—for the letters are swept out of my hand—heads & tails. Here we are, 10.30, in Jugo Slavia, a tamer more subjugated country far than Greece, the last of which we saw last night—crossing a terrific stone gorge on a crazy bridge & looking down till I quivered from our window, sitting down to dinner with Venus colliding with the moon, & a shepherds hut, & two men in long coats lit up by the electric lights of our restaurant car. Curious contrasts! Our sufficiency & civilisation drawing all compact through want, poverty, desolation, shepherds, sheep, torrents, lonely rivers winding through rocks. We dined, on the usual smoke grey china. Another bride & groom on board. Gathered in the salon at the station were all their friends come with boxes of chocolate. She said in English “Looking through my things I found this belt” & gave it to the young man with the choc. box. A few sentences—specially intimate—arch—coquettish?—in English; then a babble of Greek again. A language one doesn’t understand is always unaccented, sibyllant, soft, wavy, unidentifiable with words. Last night was bad. Very hot. Then interruptions. At Salonika (1.30) they came in to ask about money. We had been advised to hide all except 600 drachmas—where? In the electric light bell he said. An impossible idea—so we disposed them all over—in the pockets of Baedeker, in an envelope. In Yugo Slavia the same question. So on, stopping & starting all night. We woke, & washed, looking at mountains. But the time had changed back & we had to wait 2 hours for coffee. Now for Rousseau."
1932.05.11,"again this heroism in the attempt at pen & ink; but I am tired of reading Rousseau: it is 6 o’clock; & we have just said that by this time tomorrow we shall be in Monk’s House. L. will be talking to Pinka. As it is, we are shaking & rattling through Lombardy towards the Alps: & shall wake near Paris. It is a flat country set with small red houses. All is tame & rich & civilised after Greece. We went out in the rain & walked up the broad stucco streets of Belgrade yesterday: we saw nothing but very tall men in tight fitting clothes: two women in looping breeches & Turkish handkerchiefs; & so back to the train again. We saw Trieste in the same way this morning, but hot sunny [?], with its sea spread silky & boats & there attached ourselves to England by buying The Times. The paper reads empty & provincial—these good Englishmen making such a bother about the Academy & motor cars when all the time there is Athens & the Greek islands. In kindness to my eyes now & to come I stop."
1932.05.15,"And now, Whit Sunday, here we are at Monks House, & Greece is perceptibly melting: just for a moment England & Greece stood side by side, each much enlivened by the other. When we landed, the English coast seemed long low sweeping empty. I exclaimed at the extraordinary English green—with its silver mixture; & L. said the earth had an unbaked look—no red in it; & the lines of the hills so sloping. Now our road seems a garden path. This was Greece still active in our eyes. But its force is waning. Already my mind is hard at work (in my absence) arranging, editing, bringing forward, eliminating, until it will present me, unasked, with visions, as I walk, of Aegina, of Athens—the Acropolis with the incandescent pillars; the view from the goatherds hill at Delphi—no, the process is not yet complete enough for me to have detached pictures. Last nights gossip at Charleston has further strewn sand over Greece. And my head has settled down; & my body is rapidly using itself to arm chairs & soft beds & English meat & Jam.

1932.05.17,"What should be is the right attitude towards criticism? What ought I to feel & say & do when Miss B. devotes an article in Scrutiny to attacking me? She is young, Cambridge, ardent. And she says I’m a very bad writer. Now I think the thing to do is to note the pith of what is said—that I dont think—then to use the little kick of energy which opposition supplies to be more vigorously oneself. It is perhaps true that my reputation will now decline. I shall be laughed at & pointed at. What should be my attitude—clearly Arnold Bennett & Wells took the criticism of their youngsters in the wrong way. The right way is not to resent; not to .. be long suffering & Christian & submissive either. Of course, with my odd mixture of extreme rashness & modesty (to analyse roughly) I very soon recover from praise & blame. But I want to find out an attitude. The most important thing is not to think very much about oneself. To investigate candidly the charge; but not fussily, not very anxiously. On no account to retaliate by going to the other extreme—thinking too much. And now that thorn is out—perhaps too easily but then of course John interrupted."
1932.05.19,"John has interrupted to some purpose. All last night Nessa put his case for him & against the irascible Leonard & the hard work & the underpay. And today we have to discuss with him his ‘feelings’—I’m not specially sympathetic, thinking of all the time we’ve spent. And Hilda M⁠[atheson]. lunches tomorrow; with a view to—Oh dear, the Press, the Press—how much time it has cost us."
1932.05.23,"Here is a little scene that I will write, bored as I am with refurbishing Dickens.

Yesterday we were driving home [from Richmond]. As we came to Mortlake Bridge I saw some heads bobbing in the river. I thought they were boys bathing; I thought it odd; why bathe on Sunday under a bridge! And then I saw a boat flopping on its side; & then a crowd; & then putting two & two together realised that this silent bobbing scene meant that here was an accident. We stopped & got out & watched three or four people swimming very slowly in full dress the few yards to shore. Then a sound of snoring sobbing was heard. Nobody moved. Nobody was excited active or amused. One red faced dishevelled woman was lying on her back. A man was pulling & pushing her. At last they touched shore; & a bright eyed elderly man scrambled up the steep bank, ran quickly, dripping in black trousers plastered to his legs, to the parapet, where he had left a hat & an overcoat. It was a sordid, silent spectacle—this heroic rescue. Middle class people in full Sunday dress immersed in cold water. I thought of a picture of a miracle; people fully dressed floating: there was a touch of the grotesque; none of terror or sublimity. The boat lay like a log boat, on its side.

So home: & Hilda is willing; & therefore, late last night John comes & renews his application. The mixture of emotionalism & grasping is so odd: as hard as nails, & then quivering."
1932.05.25,"Now I have “finished” David Copperfield, & I say to myself cant I escape to some pleasanter atmosphere? Cant I expand & embalm & become a sentient living creature! Lord how I suffer! What a terrific capacity I possess for feeling with intensity—now, since we came back, I’m screwed up into a ball; cant get into step; cant make things dance; feel awefully detached; see youth; feel old; no, thats not quite it; wonder how a year or 20 perhaps is to be endured. Think, yet people do live; cant imagine what goes on behind faces. All is surface hard; myself only an organ that takes blows, one after another; the horror of the hard raddled faces in the [Chelsea] flower show yesterday; the inane pointlessness of all this existence; hatred of my own brainlessness & indecision: the old treadmill feeling, of going on & on & on; for no reason: Lytton’s death; Carrington’s; a longing to speak to him; all that cut away, gone. Eddy’s idiotic letter; the peevishness & egotism of Eddy; of John; the hardness & competitiveness of life; no space which one can expand in & say Time stand still here; L.’s goodness, & firmness; & the immense responsibility that rests on him. What to do about the press, about Hilda, about John; women; my book on professions; shall I write another novel; contempt for my lack of intellectual power; reading Wells without understanding; Nessa’s children; society; buying clothes; Rodmell spoilt; all England spoilt; terror at night of things generally wrong in the universe; buying clothes; how I hate Bond Street & spending money on clothes; worst of all is this disjected barrenness. And my eyes hurt; & my hand trembles.

A saying of Leonard’s comes into my head in this season of complete inanity & boredom “Things have gone wrong somehow”. It was the night Carrington killed herself. We were walking along that silent blue street with the scaffolding. I saw all the violence & unreason crossing in the air: ourselves small; a tumult outside: something terrifying: unreason. Shall I make a book out of this? It would be a way of bringing order & speed again into my world."
1932.05.26,"And now today suddenly the weight on my head is lifted. I can think, reason, keep to one thing, & concentrate. Perhaps this is the beginning of another spurt. Perhaps I owe it to my conversation with L. last night. I tried to analyse my depression: how my brain is jaded with the conflict within of two types of thought, the critical, the creative; how I am harassed by the strife & jar & uncertainty without. This morning the inside of my head feels cool & smooth instead of strained & turbulent."
1932.05.27,"Last night at Adrian’s evening. Zuckerman on apes. Doris Chapman sitting on the floor. I afraid of Eddy coming in—I wrote him a sharp, but well earned, letter. Adrian so curiously reminiscent—will talk of his school of Greece of the past as if nothing had happened in between: a queer psychological fact in him—this dwelling on the past, when there’s his present & his future all round him: D.C. to wit, & Karin coming in late, predacious, struggling, never amenable or comforting as poor woman no doubt she knows: deaf, twisted, gnarled, short, stockish—baffled, still she comes. Dick Strachey. All these cold elements of a party not mingling. L. & I talk with some effort. Duncan wanders off. Nessa gone to Tarzan. We meet James & Alix in the door. Come & dine says James with the desire strong in him I think to keep hold of Lytton. Monkeys can discriminate between light & dark: dogs cant. Tarzan is made largely of human apes. People have libraries of wild beast ‘shots’ let out on hire. Question how the lion fight was done. Real. Probably the lion was doped or had its claws cut. Talk of Greece. Talk of Spain. Dick was taken for a ghost. A feeling of distance & remoteness. Adrian sepulchral, polite, emaciated, elongated, scientific, called Adrian by Solly; then in come rapid small women, Hughes, & I think his wife. We evaporate at 11.20: courteously thanked for coming by Adrian. Question what pleasure these parties give. Some, presumably, or these singular figures wouldn’t coagulate. A pouring wet day, & we’re off to Rodmell for the week end. As for the Press, we’re to see Harold’s woman on Tuesday & contemplate a re-arrangement: no John, no Hilda, but competent underlings; Belsher coming back after her holiday. Now for more articles. But I think one fortnight will see me through."
1932.06.01,"(Derby day.) Oh dear, oh dear, I dont like dining with Clive—not altogether. It is true I conquered, at 8, my profound trepidation about my clothes. “I wont wear my new dress I said, in case I should be laughed at”. This philosophy shivered on the doorstep, when I saw two 20 horse power cars drawn up, apparently, at his door. Again I fluctuated & shivered, like a blown candle flame, when I came in & found only steamy, grubby inarticulate Rex Whistler. Why have I dressed at all I asked. Then Lord David, then Bea Howe, then Mrs Quennell. Thats all. So to dinner. And the boasting! Clive rattling out noble names. Memories of Cecils, & Godolphins: how Jack Caermarthen was engaged to Mary Baker: how the deaf duchess gondoled with the deaf Mrs Baker: but I played my tricks: jumped over the candlestick; & co operated with Clive in the great business of impressing, I think it was, Mrs Quennell. She could only remember diplomatic society in Tokio. Clive luxuriated in the Embassy at Rome. “Lady—I’ve forgotten her name oh of course, Cynthia Graham”. Then, drawing round after dinner, he put me through my paces about Eddy. And he became teasing, malicious; & he said “But you’ve never known anything—once you were out of your mind—that’s all.” & he said “Now tell the truth. You were extremely disagreeable to Eddy .. Well, well; these little hooks only scratch the surface; & there were moments of brilliant fluency which I enjoyed; when I said its far better to be here, rubbing my wits with these charming people than reading Rousseau in my drawing room; then I revoked that opinion; then I floated again; then I landed in the scrannels. No, I dont think I like Clive’s partys anymore—though theyre stirring enough. I pick up too many thorns, one way & another. His oblique method of getting his own back always exacerbates. His own—what did I steal 20 years ago that he should never feel the debt paid? Anyhow, why not refuse the next party, & rummage on my own? My own pie is full enough: Mary, Christabel, Ld David tonight, Peter Lucas, Ethel tomorrow: &c."
1932.06.02,"Lord David’s party last night. Half across London. Derby night. Great motors full of men with buttonholes. A rose pink girl tripping across Sh⁠[aftesbur]⁠y Avenue hand in hand with a young man: all fluff & roses. Edwardes Sqre very large leafy silent Georgian refined: so too no. 41 with its white & green; its one print—but nothing definite eno’ for my taste: Ly Salisbury by Sargent over the mantelpiece; a butler; an orange cat; Ld D. & Eth Bowen talking by the fire; then Puffin, then John Sparrow. Not a good dinner: meagre; exiguous; & I took too many asparagus. All adroit kind nice talk—the note of the Asquiths & Cecils. ‘How very true’—‘Yes, I agree entirely’—so different from B⁠[loomsbur]⁠y. Theres more body to us. Still I dont complain. A little confabulation about Eddy: then about crying at crowds, at theatres, at films; what is tragic; about football. Sp⁠[arrow]. is a bailer, a solid young man, just called to Chancery Bar who writes a life of Donne after dinner. Talk about Auden & Naomi Mitchison: her review of Auden read aloud: Aeschylus “& all that lot”. How she went to a party with corn in her hair: how her group knocks people down; how they pig in the Ellis’s [?] hotel; how she loves, poses, writes but its not really good, says David. Then they talked about the German youth movement: about bad people: about—Lindsey who likes lice in the head; about Murry; & I wore my new dress, too white & young perhaps; & so came home across London, & must now wash for Maynard’s lunch & the Bernard Shaws—oh damn, oh damn—not an idea in my head or a wish to be brilliant"
1932.06.03,"I dont like old ladies who guzzle. My comment upon Ethel Smyth last night—no doubt a harsh one. But she champed & chopped; & squabbled over her duck; & then was over eaten & had to go home.

My comment upon the Shaws:

he said “I am not sufficiently fond of myself to wish for immortality. I should like to be different. I should like to be a performer in music, & a mathematician. So I dont keep a diary. I destroy all my letters. So did [blank in ms.] He had had letters from every great man. He took them out in the garden & burnt them. But I couldnt burn Ellen Terry’s. They were works of art. It would have been like burning a page of the Luttrell psalter. The handwriting was a work of art. She scribb⁠[l]⁠ed them—never thought of a phrase. But I admit that when our correspondence was published I thought—I admit—I shall be the hero: not a bit of it: I have to admit that Ellen was the superior. She comes out far the better of the two. Frank Harris—his life of me was a life of himself. Theres no truth in it about me. No life of me has a word of truth in it. They say my father was persecuted, & that I was persecuted, as a boy—sent to a Wesleyan School. Desmond MacCarthy says he’s going to write my life—well, he may say so. He comes & talks—I cant tell the truth yet, about myself. The Webbs looked lonely somehow going off to Russia. He’s not growing old—no, I dont find that. I’ve always quarrelled with the Webbs. You see Webb has a gigantic faculty for absorbing information. He could have gone to Oxford—found some flaw in the statutes—proved it to the examiners. But didn’t go: only wanted to be in the right. And so, when I first knew him, I had to overcome an immense amount of useless knowledge. He had to forget things he had learnt. I always tell a story to illustrate this. When I was a boy I asked my father “What is a Unitarian” And he thought for a time & then he said, “Unitarians believe that after Christ was crucified he got down off the Cross & ran away on the other side of the hill.” Years later, when I was 30 or so, I was staying with the Trevelyans at Wellcomb; & the talk got upon Unitarians, & it flashed upon me, this cannot be the true story—but I’d always seen Christ running down the hill all those years. Webb would be much more effective if he’d one drop of the artist. But he has, not one. Beatrice is in despair about it. Cant make a good speech therefore. People think my style as speaker is spontaneous, colloquial. Its the most artificial ever known. I’ve taken long railway journeys & spent them saying the letters of the alphabet aloud so as to make my vowels strike out. Then they forget I’m an Irishman—I think quicker than the English. No I dont mug things up—when I write history I dont read it. I imagine the sort of things people would have done & then I say they did them & then I find out facts—one always can—that prove it. The great pleasure of the Broadcasting to me is that I can sit at home & conduct The Meistersinger myself. I sit with the book of the score & conduct & I’m furious when they dont follow me. That way one finds how often the singers make howlers—come in a bar early or late. Beecham—(here he sang a piece of the Magic Flute) turned that—which is solemn, slow, processionly [?]—into a hornpipe. I leapt in my seat (he leapt up his knees & clasped them in agony— he is never still a moment—he clenches his fists—he flings himself this way & that; he sprang up to go, as if he were 22, not 74 as L. remarked. What life, what vitality! What immense nervous spring! That perhaps is his genius. Immense vivacity—& why I dont read him for pleasure. His face is bright red; his nose lumpy: his eyes sea green like a sailors or a cockatoos. He doesnt much notice who’s there. Told stories about the fortunes of plays to Maynard who was rung up 3 or 4 times at lunch by his colleagues at the Savoy. The ballet starts on Monday & he has no notion if it will crash or flourish. People no longer book ahead. Shaw said they used to book 6 weeks ahead.

(I skipped this page, so will insert here how I heard Maynard say to Mrs Shaw “Well, we’re about as bad as we can be. Never been so bad. We may go over the edge—but as its never been like this, nobody knows. One would say we must”—which was uttered in the low tone of a doctor saying a man was dying in the next room; but didnt want to disturb the company. This referred to the state of Europe, while we lunched—very well too."
1932.06.04,"And last night we stopped the car in Hyde Park & I watched a people on the verge of ruin. How many Rolls Royces, & other low, pink, yellow, very powerful cars werent booming through the park like giant dor-beetles, with luxurious owners, men & women, lying back, on their way to some party. A Rolls Royce means £5000 a year. Then the children in perambulators with nurses. Then the strollers & saunterers. Then the mauve grey green trees, flushed with livid pinks & yellows; the may & the laburnum scarcely burning, like colour under water that cloudy, rainy, thunder yellow evening. So back through the West End—more cars blocked; & we on the verge of a precipice.

This is written, not so much for the sake of its historical interest, as to get the taste of Madame Bolotine’s memoirs out of my mouth. The influence is perceptible. Queer, the pervasiveness of bad writing. And still queerer, the fact that this emotional, unreal badly written, flimsy book is dearer to the writer than a child, has to be delivered by hand, & is the record of a tempestuous violent Russian life yet feebler than Mrs Bartholomew’s memoirs."
1932.06.06,"Last night, Sunday, dining at Clive’s. Just back from Wiltshire. Brown. Good tempered. Nessa heating dinner. C. cross with Lottie—too many dishes—too much fuss—does the napkins into shapes—chatter, gossip; ballet; attack on Bolitho’s Price Consort; Quentin thinks Emperor Napoleon attractive; Clive swears he’s wrong; story of Merimée in love with the Empress Mother; so to Tommy & Raymond. Some acrimony. Duncan says “Raymond needs an arboreous bush”. Nessa says T. wd. appreciate that; Raymond wouldn’t; I say T.’s a screeching gull, & ought to be happy in a lovely young wife; Nessa laughs; they say thats the agony—he isn’t happy. What worse torture? says Clive. One would agree to try living with her in Lambs Conduit St. & then the memory of happier days (always thus lyrical about lovers). And he’s falling flat says Nessa: Angus no longer loves him, nor Barbara. Raymond can make a story out of life, T. cant, I say, for all his sitting in public houses. Oh but he can, says Nessa. Raymond only sits in drawing rooms, says D. testy. (He has been testy about Cassis gossip). So to bed: a man says I lunched with Mrs —— & she has a heavenly bull pup 7 weeks old"
1932.06.13,"Back from a good week end at Rodmell—a week end of no talking, sinking at once into deep safe book reading; & then sleep: clear transparent; with the may tree like a breaking wave outside; & all the garden green tunnels, mounds of green: & then to wake into the hot still day, & never a person to be seen, never an interruption: the place to ourselves: the long hours. To celebrate the occasion I bought a little desk & L. a beehive, & we drove to the Lay; & I did my best not to see the cement sheds. The bees swarmed. Sitting after lunch we heard them outside; & on Sunday there they were again hanging in a quivering shiny brown black purse to Mrs Thompsett’s tombstone. We leapt about in the long grass of the graves, Percy all dressed up in mackintosh, & netted hat. Bees shoot whizz, like arrows of desire: fierce, sexual; weave cats cradles in the air; each whizzing from a string; the whole air full of vibration: of beauty, of this burning arrowy desire; & speed: I still think the quivering shifting bee bag the most sexual & sensual symbol. So home, through vapours, tunnels, caverns of green: with pink & yellow glass mounds in gardens—rhododendrons. To Nessa’s. Adrian has told Karin that he must separate She demurs. They are to start separate houses, he says, in the autumn.

Last week was such a scrimmage: oh so many people: among them Doris [Chapman] & Adrian: she like a dogfish: that circular slit of a mouth in a pale flesh: & an ugly rayed dress: but said by Nessa to be nice. Why the bees should swarm round her, I cant say. Now Vita rings up: may she & Harold dine tonight: then Ethel: I look ahead to my fortnights week end."
1932.06.18,"Adrian rings up & says “Can you suggest a tenant for two rooms? We’re in the throes of dividing things up.” Whether he goes & Karin stays, I dont know. John stays, on a revised basis, as adviser; Miss Scott Johnson as permanent manager; & I am to consult & help John more, & not to sit here “with a red cross on your door, so that I daren’t come in.” My advice is that he shall be more malleable, & less pernickety. He craves influence & authority, to publish the books of his friends: wishes to start a magazine; is poor; cant do without pay; must economise; live with Peggy in Pimlico. Am I too aloof—partly so as not to chatter, partly to get to my own work? Ought one to be more sympathetic; but oh so many people to see & things to fit in already: nevertheless I’ll try, if the new method is to be tried. He says Leonard is “so deep: & plans things; & never comes out at once with what he means; so that I dont know how to behave.” I daresay we’ve spent 10 hours talking about all this. Ethel more than usually controlled. Headaches skirmishing. Oh & I’m finishing the C.R.: I trust to God; have done the last article, & hope to send off to be typed tomorrow. Desmond’s criticism rather sends my value up in my eyes: can’t make a dint in a pat of butter. Man of the word. Respectable, acute, astute, to the point.

Nessa & Duncan’s private view. Tatlock smelling of drink. Horsey [?] arty people. Agnews. Mrs Grant. Mrs Rendel. All this moving round the pictures, & I meeting Ethel [Smyth] in electric blue & Quentin: & she telling us at Stewarts how Miss Liddell rolled down the steps at Marlborough House dead drunk."
1932.06.24,"On the verge of my fortnightly dip at Monk’s House. Dinner at the Hutchinsons last night: sat between Desmond & Lord Balniel. Lord & Lady Derwent also there; & Lord David [Cecil] only absent because of a sprained ankle; & Lord Chichester ringing up. “So good for Leonard” Jack said, “all these Lords.” A certain thin spread tightness in the talk. Champagne necessary. Two footmen. Lady Balniel simple hard direct plain confident young with children, aristocratic. Desmond back from Cambridge & Abbott [a friend]. Very cheerful: & I think his book so bad. How then can he be cheerful? The thin stretched whipped up champagne talk was about—oh, I said to Lord B. some nonsense about pictures: & he said my writing (I’m so well known now) was more real than his politics. “I go about in my wife’s country, & up in Lancashire: I meet the oddest people; very nice: we talk: I’ve got to make a speech at a bazaar about the Christian attitude to the unemployment question. What does it mean? And so dont get much time for pictures. David Cecil & I always loved pictures, even at Eton.” Ly D. Roumanian, passionate, dumb. Jack small talk with Lady B. Mary expanding about Sadlers Wells to B. about Courthauld. B. smoking a cheroot. D. saying what it felt like to be sick. So to the Zoo: a mist rising; white bears elongated like El Grecos: stinking meat held near my nose: bear bit a boy’s arm off; bears dived; white explosion; red & yellow fairy lamps; distant music; the sea lions, rushing like torpedoes, flouncing up the rocks; in silk coats; the blind bear; one swollen white eye; birds flying under the livid green; baby sea lions, like puppies; Mary tipping the man: her sexual response: home with Desmond till 1."
1932.06.28,"Just “finished De Quincey”. Thus am I trying to keep pace with the days & deliver the 2nd C.R. done on the last of June—which I see with dismay is Thursday. I spent last summer thus toiling over The Waves. This is less severe by a long chalk (whats the origin of that? cricket pitch? billiards?) Anyhow it blazes; swoons; the heat. Royal, imperial, are the words I fumble with in the Square. So hot yesterday—so hot, when Prince Mirsky came with his dubious fluent Russian lady: I mean she was full of temperament; had the free gestures of the Slav; but Mirsky was trap mouthed; opened & bit his remark to pieces: has yellow misplaced teeth; wrinkles his forehead; dispair, suffering, very marked on his face. Has been in England, in boarding houses for 12 years; now returns to Russia ‘for ever’. I thought as I watched his eye brighten & fade—soon there’ll be a bullet through your head. Thats one of the results of war: this trapped cabin’d man: but that didnt lubricate our tea.

Vita came in; then Alix; both relieved of their books (Vita’s is said to be bad) & so rather elated. Vita is driving west, alone, for 4 days today. An American has offered her £250 for 2,000 words; & will offer the same to me. I doubt it. Alix like a red Indian; so large boned, & with wrinkles, & sunburn like an Indians. And tonight, to my considerable alarm, at opening an entirely new door, into an entirely new room, I dine with Katharine Furse. And here’s Morgan come to lunch. So enough."
1932.06.29,"The room was a very sumptuous room; a wide staircase led to it; a broad hall. I was early. “What a magnificent cabinet!” I said to hide my nervousness, with this old charwoman in the tight dress & black stockings. All her hair has shrunk. She has the hardened, lined, drawn face of a very unhappy woman. Why, in that light she looked terrible to me. Where had the handsome Katharine gone: she who strode; had firm red cheeks; & was decisive, masterly, controlled even in the great trench [?] of her unhappiness? Heavens, what an injury life inflicts! To have replaced that dashing youth with this almost intolerable look of suffering: a grudging look; a scraped bare look; the ugly poor woman look. By dint of arrangement, by looking through half closed eyes I could, as the evening wore on & the light faded piece together something fine: her eyes; small but penetrating; her gestures—they are still free & bold, though so much hampered by bare arms & tight ugly black & blue dress. What is fine is that she conceals nothing; has no shrinking left; has been wrung & mangled out of the softnesses & sensibilities. How white her face is, too; yet she commanded her table—her & Follett’s table—with the old mastery; but as if nothing gave her any pleasure. She never relaxed. Never lost her look of suffering the whole evening. To harden to blunt to coarsen that is the worst damage age—& I daresay she’s only 8 years older than I am—can inflict. Is this all Charles’ death? Or what? The talk spattered & sprinkled. A dry precise old pepperbox called Cabot, professor of Harvard, his vague wife, Mary Follett, verbose, diffuse—that was the party & we sat & let the light turn grey & cold & all the cabinets grow dim—all very elderly & ugly. Was that contained in my dismay with Katharine—the sense I look like that too. Perhaps. Then Leonard came in, in his grey suit & blue tie, sunburnt; & I felt that we are still vigorous & young. And so kissed Katharine the old woman on the doorstep. Yes, last time we met she was driving a dogcart: & it was a cold winters day, & she was going to the docks to look at treasure."
1932.07.03,"Whenever I suck my pen, my lip is covered with ink. And I have no ink with which to fill my pot; & it is 10 minutes past 12; & I have just finished Hardy; & I promise myself that the C.R. will be finally done by Wednesday next. And today is Sunday. Last night at 10. the Zeppelin came past with a string of light hanging from its navel. This consoled me for not having gone to the last night of the [Camargo] ballet.

Now I have cleaned my table; which John inherits while I’m away. And I should now attack Ch. Rossetti. But Lord, how tired one gets of one’s own writing."
1932.07.06,"Today is Wednesday & the CR I confess is not yet quite done. But then—well I had to re-write the last article, which I had thought so good, entirely. Not for many years shall I collect another bunch of articles. Many many people, too, & parties still to be transacted. On Sunday the Bussies; he detached ironic Gallic; she intense, worried, ineffective rather; money troubles; war loan investments vanished; they’re left with £80 income. But we shall go to Spain in September said Simon. Then to Angelica, passing the funeral in Epping forest; Nessa made her dress for the ballet party sitting in a field after lunch, while Quentin & Angelica wandered & L. made up an article & spoke to an old man in a hedge. Then Adrian came on Sunday night, garrulous & cheerful; talking science: then [on 4 July] we dined with the James’s: Alix Red Indian: James trying to extend a feeler from his hard nut. I’m an old friend, Lytton’s friend. Will we choose books. How Carrington lied to him the night before Lytton died: said she wd not kill herself; was found unconscious in the car later. How regular your books are I said: a mere weed, he said of Eddy in Lytton’s way

These days have been very hot & very busy: books out tomorrow, Plomer, my letter & Hugh’s."
1932.07.08,"And so I fainted, at the Ivy: & had to be led out by Clive. A curious sensation. Feeling it come on; sitting still & fading out: then Clive by my side & a woman with salts. And the odd liberation of emotion in the cab with Clive; & the absolute delight of dark & bed: after that stony rattling & heat & Frankie shouting; & things being churned up, removed.

I write this on a blazing morning, because L. is instructing Miss C⁠[ashin]. how to arrange the books: so that I cant correct articles. “Everywhere I look everything is hopeless…. Either the Northern Saga ought not to be here at all—or it ought to be in the other room…. (John is ill: publishing day yesterday; Harold drivelling snapping, when I hoped for ‘serious criticism’—why go on hoping?) the whole of thats going over—Here are 3 things of Nature has no tune of wh. we dont sell a copy a year….”

Oh dear, I’ve twenty minutes to use; & cant ‘correct’ any more. What a fling I shall have into fiction & freedom when this is off! At once, an American comes to ask me to consider writing articles for some huge figure. And (hushed be this said) I sent Nessa a cheque for £100 last night: & Leonard gave his mother £50, & Philip [his youngest brother] £50. These are among the solid good things, I think: Nessa’s £100 will buy her some release from worry, I hope: Clive saying they must spend £600 a year less. Roger to have his operation, said to be slight, tomorrow. Adrian fretted to death—almost to fainting in the street—must anyhow stumble in to Nessa’s & ask for water & spend the evening—by the vagaries of his Doris. This is what Francis foretold: a girl of dubious morality, & to me like a codfish in her person. And there are fleas at M⁠[onks].H⁠[ouse].: to which we go; & black beetles here, & said to be mice also."
1932.07.11,"I will take a new pen & a new page to record the fact which is now a fact that I have slipped a green rubber band round the Common Reader, second series, & there it lies, at 10 minutes to one, ready to take upstairs. There is no sense of glory; only of drudgery done. And yet I daresay its a nice enough book to read—I doubt that I shall write another like it all the same. I must find a quicker cut into books than this. But heaven be praised, not now. Now I’m taking a holiday. That is to say, what shall I write tomorrow? I can sit down & think."
1932.07.13,"I have been sleeping over a promising novel. Thats the way to write. Its a livid hot day; & Clive has been summoned to take Mary Baker to Claridges—Oh dont think me too frivolous—& may I know who was coming—what young lady—& we’ve got Morgan instead—a change all to L.’s liking. Almost our last party.

I’m ruminating, as usual, how to improve my lot; & shall begin by walking, alone, in Regents Park this afternoon. What I mean is why do a single thing one doesn’t want to do—for instance buy a hat or read a book? Old Joseph Wright & Lizzie Wright are people I respect. Indeed I do hope the 2nd vol. will come this morning. He was a maker of dialect dixeries: he was a workhouse boy—his mother went charing. And he married Miss Lea a clergyman’s daughter. And I’ve just read their love letters with respect. And he said “Always please yourself—then one person’s happy at any rate”. And she said “make details part of a whole—get proportions right”—contemplating marriage with Joe. Odd how rare it is to meet people who say things that we ourselves could have said. Their attitude to life much our own. Joe a very thick sturdy man—‘I am unique in certain respects’ he said. ‘We must leave some record of Joe & Lizzie to posterity’. Had his old working mother to Oxford. She thought All Souls would make a good Co-op. Had a fist & struck boys. His notion of learning. I sometimes would like to be learned myself. About sounds & dialects. Still what use is it? I mean, if you have that mind why not make something beautiful? Yes, but then the triumph of learning is that it leaves something done solidly for ever. Everybody knows now about dialect, owing to his dixery. He is a coarse, sturdy variety of Sidney Webb & Walter Leaf—stockish, hairy; more humorous & forcible than either. Could work all night, wash, & work all next day. Miss Weisse, Tovey’s lady, brought them together—made Lizzy give up arranging the flowers in the Rectory & go to Oxford. She a woman of character. Wouldnt accept Jo’s offer of a job because he made her feel like a bear at the end of a chain. But she married him. They were lost in the woods by Virginia Water in 1896: & sat on a seat & had an hour of great suffering, after which she accepted him—they got on a bakers cart & were taken back to Miss Weisse. An absorbing story. Joe knew all about servants. Joe taught himself to read at 14; taught mill boys in a bedroom for 2d a week; a surly but very sensitive man, apparently. Now this is a testimony to Joe & Lizzy that I’ve been thinking how I should have liked to see them—would now like to write to her. A fine face with bright big eyes—yes—but what happens in volume two?"
1932.07.14,"‘Immunity’ I said to myself half an hour ago, lying back in my chair. Thats the state I am (or was) in. And its a holy, calm, satisfactory flawless feeling—To be immune, means to exist apart from rubs, shocks, suffering; to be beyond the range of darts; to have enough to live on without courting flattery, success; not to need to accept invitations; not to mind other people being praised; to feel This—to sit & breathe behind my screen, alone, is enough; to be strong; content; to let Nessa & D. go to Paris without envy; to feel no one’s thinking of me; to feel I have done certain things & can be quiet now; to be mistress of my hours; to feel detached from all sayings about me; & claims on me; to be glad of lunching alone with Leonard; to have a spare time this afternoon; to read Coleridge’s letters. Immunity is an exalted calm desirable state, & one I could reach much oftener than I do."
1932.07.16,"Stella Benson last night: as quiet, as controlled, white, drawn as usual, also deaf: with steady honest eyes; said she had been to a great many parties. “I just say nothing. I feel none of these people matters. They say how much they liked my book .. I was given a medal. The old gentleman couldnt remember what for. He pinned it on. Both my dogs are dead. I liked one for bounding. But that was only a sign of Stannard’s disease. I go back in August—to Linlon (or some such name) a mud island. I hate Hong Kong. They play games. At Government House they give you a slip of paper with names of games on it: you have to put a cross next the one you play. Sitting out is one. James & I choose that. So we sit out together.” That was her style in a very weak but persistent voice; she coughs; & then goes on with a mild persistent patience. She is bleached; even her blue eyes are bleached. But at the same time she’s practical; realistic: talked, of course, of “Pearnie”—doesnt like her—& making money by stories; & Harpers & so on; in a sensible matter of fact way, like a working class woman. Then smiles with her charming steady eyes. The light faded grey in the drawing room, & she sat there lying back telling us in a very low voice, which went on steadily about the slave trade in H.K.; about James & his little Chinese destroyer, manned by ex-officers from England; how they steam out after sailing ships: the ships cant escape; they throw out bales of cotton & flannel: which float: James goes aboard & discovers the deck laden with opium, heroin; man cries out “That little parcel’s for my father. Let me have that”. Then all the other men say that the cement &c is a present for an aunt. There’s always fighting. Chinese planes come over very low down. Shoot with revolvers. She sits in her kitchen. All the inhabitants crowd round, thinking the English safe—pretend they’re selling eggs. Chinese generals come to dine & stand rifles on each side of their chairs: send soldiers into the kitchen to see that the food isn’t poisoned. She goes back for another two years. Writes & writes. Must buzz home in her little Morris Cowley to write 8 pages of her monthly notes for Time & Tide. I ask why? Oh its good pay. Has bought a house in Kensington. Will come back for 2 years with James, who will be The O’Gorman. All this serious, weary, intent. I like her & was glad to sign her Waves."
1932.07.18,"Clive & Mary [Baker] last night, small, pink, underbred; not a woman of the world; without distinction; nice; rich; has lived above her means, spiritually & socially; has a little edge to her mind; tells her little story. Clive’s bad manners—how she almost married Ld C⁠[armar]⁠then; might stand in a Tobacconists — — waspish; enamoured; C. bending over her cigarette case; fetching her coat (black: expensive): all this strained; incredible to spend weeks with her: no prestige attached; no glow; a little pickety, nervous, enthusiastic, hysterical dog—for all the world like the little yapping dog that ran mad round the Round Pond. Nessa (next day, going to the carpet shop) says Ah yes, but think of the speed boat!"
1932.07.21,"Oh but I’m so tired—I sometimes think people cant know what they do to me when they ask me to ‘see’ them: how they hold me in the scorching light: how I dry & shrivel: how I lie awake at night longing for rest—this is true. But know that I’m to be pitchforked up into the light & the glare again next day. Mary [Hutchinson] yesterday; Ethel today; Adrian tomorrow: & Ju⁠[lia Strachey], Since Monday, Nessa, Angelica: Tom & Eth Bowen; Katharine & Follett; then Adrian’s suicidal face at night gave me the nightmare. And my head aches; & my back; & I’m sapped; wilted. Never mind. I shall lie in the cool at Monks House.

Alice Ritchie ringing me up about dinner, said “One thing I want to say. Please dont go so far away in your next book”. She had just re-read The Waves: magnificent: but loneliness almost unbearable. Mrs Hardy writes that she has often wished, after my wonderful article on Hardy, that she had asked me to write his life. Had I consented she would have given me all the materials. And how proud I was to be asked to do the T.L.S. article!

On the other hand, my poet letter passes unnoticed."
1932.07.22,"I do not like Ethel when she is doing the powerful stunt—or whatever stunt it is: proclaiming that all is over; denouncing me; protesting her love; whipping up a scene; being august; despairing; melodramatic, & wobbly & weak all at the same time. No I do not like it: & also I am bored. This is the old fashioned version of an emotional scene—the tactics are to leave the other person in a hole—where indeed I would willingly have been left, if I had not remembered then all the letters I should have to write & the telephones: so I shouted after her, as she stumped down stairs, “Do you want your letters?” & as she tied them up—the HB letters—I teased & railed, & felt the hollowness of it all, & her unattractive old age—not much else, so dusty & jaded I am—& she went—in what mood I do not know. Its the superficiality of these things that disenchants one: her lust for emotion. Or so I felt. Seeing herself, dramatising herself instead of being anything.

But I am distraught & lazy: I am frittering away these last mornings experimenting with little stories; but, as L. says, the change makes all work impossible: the sorting⁠[;] packing; like a dog one senses the move; then there’s Adrian tonight, & Julia & so on: then there’s Welwyn I think tomorrow. Nessa is gone; oh & my proofs will soon be coming; oh & I want to think out certain problems: & to be more vagarious: not yet to eat myself into a book. I want to go to Ireland, could that be managed. Are we too aloof, & absorbed—this work—whats the use of so much money—familiar thoughts: also another novel: Desmond gets between, why⁠[?]: his tepid praise; & the difficulty: peoples minds & bodies to be separated; & clothes; & demeanour; & the autumn; & our relations with people. Dine & sleep parties. &c."
1932.08.05,"Rodmell

Yesterday L. came in to my room at Breakfast & said Goldie is dead. One of those muddles apparently; he refused to tell his sister; took advice only of Morgan & Gerald Heard; was anxious to be economical; went to Guys; had an operation, secretly, a week ago; Roger saw him on Tuesday (I think) thought the little cubicle dirty; talked; supposed him to be recovering; he died suddenly that night, of an internal haemorrhage. There was no time to send for anybody. These are the dismal details of the end of that fine charming spirit—so much a spirit that my thought was, anyhow he wont mind. And then, how much of a piece with our friends, like him, we are; it is thus we die, when they die. Regrets for not having had him here. He made his farewell intentionally at the [Apostles’] dinner in June: spoke of death & not minding it. I never knew him well but had the common feeling that I have with those trusty Cambridge fellows; & was pleased, of course, by what he wrote of The Waves; & so came nearer. I get the strangest feeling now of our all being in the midst of some vast operation: of the splendour of this undertaking—life: of being capable of dying: an immensity surrounds us. No—I cant get it—shall let it brood itself into ‘a novel’, no doubt. (Its thus I get the conception from which the book condenses). At night L. & I talked of death again the second time this year: we may be like worms crushed by a motor car: what does the worm know of the car—how it is made? There may be a reason; if so not one we, as human beings, can grasp. Goldie had some mystic belief.

And now we have been to Lewes races & seen the fat lady in black with parts of her person spilling over the shooting seat on which her bulk is so insecurely poised: seen the riff raff of sporting society all lined up in their cars with the dickies bulging with picnic baskets: heard the bark of bookies; & seen for a second the pounding straining horses with red faced jockeys lashing them pound by. What a noise they made—what a sense of muscle hard & stretched—& beyond the downs this windy sunny day looked wild & remote; & I could rethink them into uncultivated land again.

So people will go on dying until we die, Leonard said. Lytton, Carrington, Goldie—all last August to be spoken to—or let go, alas, because of the many times one would see them. That is one of my results: not to let friends lapse. But what can one do? One has to follow ones bent—mine often to be moody, irritable, longing for solitude. I will try to write to Helen: to ask Saxon down. These are the little efforts I make against death—& am at the same time, annoyed that my clean dress hasn’t come, & that I’ve re-arranged the drawing room to L.’s liking to my disliking."
1932.08.17,"Now I think I have corrected the CR till I can correct no longer. And I have a few minutes holiday, before I need take the proofs in to L. Shall I then describe how I fainted again?—That is the galloping horses got wild in my head last Thursday night as I sat on the terrace with L. How cool it is after the heat! I said. We were watching the downs draw back into fine darkness after they had burnt like solid emerald all day. Now that was being softly finely veiled. And the white owl was crossing to fetch mice from the marsh. Then my heart leapt; & stopped; & leapt again; & I tasted that queer bitterness at the back of my throat; & the pulse leapt into my head & beat & beat, more savagely, more quickly. I am going to faint I said & slipped off my chair & lay on the grass. Oh no I was not unconscious. I was alive; but possessed with this struggling team in my head: galloping, pounding. I thought something will burst in my brain if this goes on. Slowly it muffled itself. I pulled myself up, & staggered, with what infinite difficulty & alarm, now truly fainting & seeing the garden painfully lengthened & distorted, back back back—how long it seemed—could I drag myself?—to the house; & gained my room & fell on my bed. Then pain, as of childbirth; & then that too slowly faded; & I lay presiding, like a flickering light, like a most solicitous mother, over the shattered splintered fragments of my body. A very acute & unpleasant experience."
1932.08.20,"A curious day in London yesterday. I said to myself standing at L.’s window, ‘Look at the present moment because its not been so hot for 21 years.’ There was a hot wind, as if one passed over a kitchen, going from the studio to the Press. Outside girls & young men lying in white on the Square grass. So hot we couldn’t sit in the dining room. L. fetched & carried & hardly let me walk upstairs carrying my own body. Coming back we had the car shut & the windscreen open—thus sat in a hot rough gale, which, as we came to the lanes & woods became deliciously cold & green. The coolest place is the front seat of a car going at 40 or 50 miles with the windscreen open. Today, at 12.30 a wind rose: clouds descended; now at 3.45 its almost a normal warm summer day. For 10 days this heat has lasted. After my faint my head soon throbs: or so I think. I think, a little, of dying suddenly. & reflect well then go about eating & drinking & laughing & feeding the fish. Odd—the silliness one attributes to death—the desire one has to belittle it, & be found as Montaigne said, laughing with girls & good fellows. And L. is staking out the dewpond; & I am going in to be photographed.

1932.09.02,"After this the wind blew & released all the prisoners—so I thought, walking on the down above Lewes in the sudden slaty chill. But thats long past; & it is a sea fret today, as we had meant to go to Canterbury. As we had meant—but whats the good of meaning when at any moment there’s a tap—behold Tom & Vivienne [Eliot]: we cant buy our fish for dinner. But it was a friendly thought,—she wild as Ophelia—alas no Hamlet would love her, with her powdered spots—in white satin, L. said; Tom, poor man, all battened down as usual, prim, grey, making his kind jokes with her. “Oh but why didn’t they tell me Adrian Stephen was your brother. Why? Why! Nobody mentioned it. They kept it from me.” Then her chops & changes. Where is my bag? Where—where—then a sudden amorous embrace for me—& so on: trailing about the garden—never settling—seizing the wheel of their car—suddenly telling Tom to drive—all of which he bears with great patience: feeling perhaps that his 7 months of freedom draw near. In the middle of their tea the post came with an astonishing letter from John to say that he does not intend to carry out our agreement. He has left the press. L. says he will send no answer. What could one say indeed? What a blessing! That egotistical young man with all his jealousies & vanities & ambitions, his weakness & changeableness is no loss. But we—or L. has lost an infinity of time. I suppose the severity with wh. L. was speaking to him on Friday when I came in to say Teas ready upset his trembling apple cart: his vanity could no longer endure: so he threw up the sponge, but I must say with the least possible good manners or consideration. On the whole though what a mercy. Now I can roam about the basement unperturbed. And, coming from him, with this crashing folly, one can take the line of least resistance—needn’t attempt the amicable go between—needn’t ask him to dinner.

A happy lively summer this—& I enjoy my freak of writing Flush—& think it a good idea—this easy indolent writing once in a way—to let my brain cool; & here I am, asked to write about ‘my father’ in the Times. No. So to give old Mrs Grey her basket of plums. The Common Reader went off on Monday last."
1932.09.16,"I’m in such a tremor that I’ve botched the last—penultimate chapter of Flush—is it worth writing that book—& can scarcely sit still, & must therefore scribble here, making myself form my letters, because—oh ridiculous crumpled petal—Wishart is publishing L.’s snap shot of me instead of the Lenare photograph & I feel that my privacy is invaded; my legs show; & I am revealed to the world (1,000 at most) as a plain dowdy old woman. How odd! I never gave the matter a thought till this morning. I sent the photographs off with some compunction at being too late. Now I’m all of a quiver—cant read or write; & can, rightly, expect little sympathy from L. What an ill joined web of nerves—to be kind—my being is! A touch makes the whole thing quiver. What can it matter? The complex is: privacy invaded, ugliness revealed—oh & that I was trapped into it by Wishart. Lord! One of the contributory causes is the auctioneers catalogue of the Rodmell sale. My ivy blooming walk is to be sold for building (the bees on the ivy bloom—quoted one afternoon by Tom). A road is to be made from Deans to the down path. All is to be houses inside. Shall we try to buy? Is it worth saving one crumb when all is threatened? Yet on my walk—too long—I was tired—& leapt in my bed dreaming that Angelica was dead—what a dream—how vivid—on my walk I almost felt my mind glow like hot iron—so complete & holy was the old habitual beauty of England: the silver sheep clustering; & the downs soaring, like birds wings sweeping up & up—I said [to] myself that beauty had become almost entirely satisfactory (oh my legs in the snapshot). I mean, I can fasten on a beautiful day, as a bee fixes itself on a sunflower. It feeds me, rests me, satisfies me, as nothing else does—(well thats not quite true: when Nessa, Duncan & the children come I brim equally; but with a thinner, more exciting ardour—I think a better heat⁠[?] & rapture—but not this.) This has a holiness. This will go on after I’m dead.

A very good summer, this, for all my shying & jibbing, my tremors this morning. Beautifully quiet, airy, powerful. I believe I want this more humane existence for my next—to spread carelessly among one’s friends—to feel the width & amusement of human life: not to strain to make a pattern just yet: to be made supple, & to let the juice of usual things, talk, character, seep through me, quietly, involuntarily before I say—Stop, & take out my pen. Yes, my thighs now begin to run smooth: no longer is every nerve upright.

Yesterday we took plums to old Mrs Grey. She is shrunk, & sits on a hard chair in the corner, the door open. She twitches & trembles. Has the wild expressionless stare of the old. L. liked her despair: I crawls up to bed hoping for the day; & I crawls down hoping for the night. “I’m an ignorant old woman—cant write or read. But I prays to God every night to take me—oh to go to my rest. Nobody can say what pains I suffer. Feel my shoulder” & she began shuffling with a safety pin. I felt it. “Hard as iron—full of water—& my legs too”—She pulled down her stocking. The dropsy. “I’m ninety two; & all my brothers & sisters are dead; my daughters dead; my husband is dead…” She repeated her misery, her list of ills, over & over; could see nothing else; could only begin all over again; & kissed my hand, thanking us for our pound. This is what we make of our lives—no reading or writing—keep her alive with parish doctors when she wishes to die—Human ingenuity in torture is very great."
1932.10.02,"London

Yes. I will allow myself a new nib. Odd how coming back here upsets my writing mood. Odder still how possessed I am with the feeling that now, aged 50, I’m just poised to shoot forth quite free straight & undeflected my bolts whatever they are. Therefore all this flitter flutter of weekly newspapers interests me not at all. These are the soul’s changes. I dont believe in ageing. I believe in forever altering one’s aspect to the sun. Hence my optimism. And to alter now, cleanly & sanely, I want to shuffle off this loose living randomness: people; reviews; fame; all the glittering scales; & be withdrawn; & concentrated. So I shant run about, just yet, buying clothes, seeing people. We are off to Leicester tomorrow, to the Labour party conference. Then back to the fever of publishing. My C.R. doesnt cause me a single tremor. Nor Holtby’s book. I’m interested in watching what goes on for the moment without wishing to take part—a good frame of mind, when one’s conscious of power. Then I am backed now by the downs: the country: how happy L. & I are at Rodmell: what a free life that is—sweeping 30 or 40 miles; coming in when & how we like; sleeping in the empty house; dealing triumphantly with interruptions; & diving daily into that divine loveliness—always some walk: & the gulls on the purple plough; or going over to Tarring Neville—these are the flights I most love now—in the wide, the indifferent air. No being jerked, teased, tugged. And people come easily, flowering into intimacy in my room. But this is the past, or future.

I am also reading DHL. with the usual sense of frustration. Not that he & I have too much in common—the same pressure to be ourselves: so that I dont escape when I read him; am surfeited; what I want is to be made free of another world. This Proust does. To me Lawrence is airless, confined: I dont want this, I go on saying. And the repetition of one idea. I dont want that either. I dont want ‘a philosophy’ in the least; I dont believe in other people’s reading of riddles. What I enjoy (in the Letters) is the sudden visualisation: the great ghost springing over the wave (of the spray in Cornwall) but I get no satisfaction from his explanations of what he sees. And then its harrowing: this panting effort after something; & ‘I have £6.10 left’ & then Government hoofing him out, like a toad; & banning his book; the brutality of civilised society to this panting agonised man: & how futile it was. All this makes a sort of gasping in his letters. And none of it seems essential. So he pants & jerks. Then too I dont like strumming with two fingers—& the arrogance. After all English has one million words: why confine yourself to 6? & praise yourself for so doing. But its the preaching that rasps me. Like a person delivering judgment when only half the facts are there; & clinging to the rails & beating the cushion. Come out & see whats up here—I want to say. I mean its so barren; so easy; giving advice on a system. The moral is, if you want to help, never systematise—not till you’re 70: & have been supple & sympathetic & creative & tried out all your nerves & scopes. He died though at 45. And why does Aldous say he was an ‘artist’? Art is being rid of all preaching: things in themselves: the sentence in itself beautiful: multitudinous seas; daffodils that come before the swallow dares: whereas L⁠[awrence]. would only say what proved something. I havent read him of course. But in the Letters he cant listen beyond a point; must give advice; get you in to the system too. Hence his attraction for those who want to be fitted; which I dont: indeed I think it a blasphemy this fitting of Carswells into a Lawrence system. So much more reverent to leave them alone: nothing else to reverence except the Carswellism of Carswell. Hence his minds schoolboy tweaking & smacking of anyone offered to him: Lytton, Bertie,—Squire—all are suburban, unclean. His ruler coming down & measuring them. Why all this criticism of other people? Why not some system that includes the good? What a discovery that would be—a system that did not shut out."
1932.10.13,"It was an odd sight—Desmond with Rachel on his arm. Everybody stood up. The white & red procession with the cross in front went ahead. Then very small, smooth, pale & sleek appeared Rachel & Desmond arm in arm. I have never seen him as a father. Now he was that—gentle, kind—leading his daughter. She was a wax work—with her diamond cross; very pale; very small; carrying a white book. Oh but the inadequacy of the service—the sense of its being the entirely obsolete & primitive voice of a defunct tribal magnate, laying down laws for the government of the tribe: & then these civilised sceptical people letting themselves pretend that they obey. That clogged & diluted all the real feeling. And David’s high collar & tails: & their sober, decorous backs kneeling there: & the respectability & the wavering watery music: the perpetual compromise. I sat with Hope. Opposite were the sort of women one sees in Oxford St. at midday. (11.30). The bridegrooms side was notably better tailored & more distinguished than ours—where, as I imagine, all the Ritchies & so on had come, saying well, I’m a first cousin so I needn’t buy new gloves. Molly was much as a pouter pigeon in some maroon dress with a yellow bunch. The ceremony went decorously forward in that grey brown church. Now & then one heard a shout from the market. No I dont like the ceremony. They hauled a dilapidated bishop up by the armpits to give the blessing which he did in a trembling overemphatic voice, as if he were scrubbing the heads of David & Rachel as he called them. Then a sort of inner play went forward behind glass doors. One saw Salisburys & MacCs signing books. Then a dribble back of relatives. Then the Wagner wedding march. Then David & Rachel arm in arm sleep walking down the aisle preceded by a cross which ushered them into a car & so into a happy long life, I make no doubt—but thats not the ceremony I like—oh no not at all. And following in the wake of the sleep walkers came the Salisburys & the MacCarthys arm in arm: dwindling into Dermod & a wizened old lady—presumably old Mrs M. [Rachel’s brother and grandmother.] “Theyre hideously plain” Hope kept saying—indeed green grey light at midday off old stone is not genial—oh & I wanted some rapture—some precious stone to hold. None. None. Only endless small observations—Hubert C⁠[ornish, Rachel’s uncle], carrying two umbrellas—Ralph & Frances in grey tweeds—late—taking prominent places. Lady Oxford, Lady Hartington, Ly Colefax, Maurice Baring & so on. A queer little dolls face, Rachel’s, to harbour a passion, to bear children. And I got washed up against the Bishop going out, & heard him apologise to the cleric. But it is an honour to support a Bishop, said that man. And then they began talking about so & so, Colonel of the Scotts guards, & so to the episcopal motor car, which was holding up the meat salesmen—with its gold cross. And now Desmond is stretched out by the fire in slippers, preparing his BBC talk I daresay: & Rachel & David are—shall we say—in a first class reserved carriage going to Sherborne: & he is putting the rug straight over her knees; & she is looking at the fields, thinking Why has the whole world been given me: then they have tea: I should think he will be shy tonight.

Today the CR is out & I havent give it a thought, being entirely absorbed in my Essay, which I began yesterday. The last 3 or four days I’ve done parcels in a daze: Belsher ill; 6,000 Family History [by V. Sackville-West] to be despatched: a great bundle of orders found last night hidden in a drawer.

But I still see the two doll figures kneeling—for all the world like a picture—what do I mean? I’m too sleepy to say. And now for Spender."
1932.11.02,"He [Stephen Spender] is a rattle headed bolt eyed young man, raw boned, loose jointed who thinks himself the greatest poet of all time. I daresay he is—it’s not a subject that interests me enormously at the moment. What does? My own writing of course. I’ve just polished up the L⁠[eslie].S⁠[tephen]. for the Times—a good one, I think, considering the currents that sway round that subject in the Times of all papers. And I have entirely remodelled my ‘Essay’. Its to be an Essay-Novel, called the Pargiters—& its to take in everything, sex, education, life &c; & come, with the most powerful & agile leaps, like a chamois across precipices from 1880 to here & now—Thats the notion anyhow, & I have been in such a haze & dream & intoxication, declaiming phrases, seeing scenes, as I walk up Southampton Row that I can hardly say I have been alive at all, since the 10th Oct. Everything is running of its own accord into the stream, as with Orlando. What has happened of course is that after abstaining from the novel of fact all these years—since 1919—& N⁠[ight]. & D⁠[ay]. indeed, I find myself infinitely delighting in facts for a change, & in possession of quantitities beyond counting: though I feel now & then the tug to vision, but resist it. This is the true line, I am sure, after The Waves—The Pargiters—this is what leads naturally on to the next stage—the essay-novel. Then of course being so excited, so incandescent, I must needs fire up about Priestley & his priestliness, & write an essay, wh. L. very rightly advised against sending to the N. Statesman. So I have cellared it, against a rainy day, when I shall re-write it as an essay Middlebrow. And then all this incandescence led to the galloping horses in my heart the night before last. I lay in bed reasoning that I could not come smash. Death I defy you, &c. But it was a terrific effort, holding on to the reins. So at 2.30 I woke L. & asked, very reasonably, for ice, which he got me. And my horses calmed down—he was so sensible. And I slept after a time, but Elly [Rendel] came yesterday & says I am putting a strain on my heart, which of course gives out, at the Ivy, or in the garden, though there’s nothing wrong; so I take this as permission not to go to parties, like Mary’s at Sadlers Wells, not to do anything I dislike. And thats a great discovery. I think I shall have thus a very reasonable happy winter, writing The Pargiters, but for Gods sake, I must be careful, & go quietly, & order my litter of excitements—people like Logan & Eddy who torment me with their vanity; I must brood & chew & dream, & be entirely natural, feeling as I do for the first time that this book is important. Why do I feel this, & I never felt it in the least about the others? I have joined Pippa’s Society; we dined with Pippa [on 27 October] & she told us stories about cows & chimney pots."
1932.11.20,"I am taking a morning off, having done the child scene—the man exposing himself—in the Pargiters: to polish my LS. (done) & then to write letters. Theres Ott’s memoir—a queer thing that Ott shd. come, after all these years, old shabby tender to my sofa; & I liked her; its her integrity thats sloppy; thats what we all slipped on. Cant tell the truth about love—but then thats so interesting, & not discreditable, considering her upbringing—Welbeck, the young men servants. So she lent me her memoirs, full as they are of love letters, & copulation. I must now write to her—& to Margaret Ll.D. & so on. Janet Case comes to tea today, & then theres Derick Leon & Julia to dinner— A long day for me, who must must must be quiet & spacious this autumn, to finish the P⁠[argiter]⁠s. How important I feel it!—well, this is the merest note .. And we’ve bought a Lanchester: to be delivered on Dec. 10th. Grey & green. I dont think we’ve ever been so happy, what with one thing & another. And so intimate, & so completely entire, I mean L. & I. If it could only last like this another 50 years—life like this is wholly satisfactory, to me anyhow. So to my letters.

[Undated]

Yes it was a long day & I had two days of jump jump afterwards; but owing to the caution of the cat on broken glass, I am now steadier. I was not ‘on the sofa’ yesterday; which has been my refuge after tea. And I’ve fought with Eddy; & with Logan; & L. is fighting with John; & we are the victors, I think, in all these fights: I’m rid of Eddy, have Logan to tea on his own terms; & John is in tears consulting his lawyer. But oh, how I’ve written since Oct 11th! So much that my fingers cant write, of an evening: my brain spins scene after scene. Its only the signs of some fatigue, & depression that leave me ten minutes now before lunch for this starved book."
1932.12.04,"I must finish the first part—which is to be called 1880—in a day or two; & then freshen up: & read, for the next part—1880-1900.

On Wednesday we gave our party: notable for its peeresses, its chatter, its cocktails: Ott, Ly Oxford, the Gages—& so on. Us two hussies entertaining the peerage: & boys in white jackets handing blue green yellow drinks. And my money £100—lent them—did the trick. Rather a fertile way of spending money, though I may be landed with 4 great panels. My carpet, Duncan’s, for the drawing room is come & down: & we have risen socially to the rank of the younger sons of baronets—it is like being real gentry, sitting with our feet embedded in pile.

And then, on Friday, we went to Brixton to Sophie. Maud a stout matron. Sophy presiding like a born lady. “This is more of a party to me she said; indeed it was—more than the cocktail one."
1932.12.17,"I have precisely 4 minutes before luncheon in which to record Rebecca West at dinner—oh yes a very clever woman, rather rubbed about the thorax: with a great supply of worldly talk: & much go & humour; a silky careening society voice; flowers from her afterwards to apologise for staying till 1.30.

And Logan—lord, what a bore: a dogmatic cultivated American bore; no truth in him; but an uneasy worm squirming for compliments. This I could see through his shallow water; & was ‘very severe’ L. says (L. is always a judge of my severity: & I of his) but I cant keep my temper when people thrust. Its not playing the game. And then—oh ever so many people; & a wind up with L.’s family & then the Frys to dinner: & we’re cheated of the car for Christmas, God damn their souls: all this is very helter skelter: & dinner with Hope last night: her stuffed black dachshund sausage stretched along my knee; & so to Rodmell on Tuesday. I’ve almost written out my first fury—234 typewritten pages since Oct 10th—& shall put my brain to rest for a few days at Monks House. But the fun of the book is to come, with Magdalena & Elvira."
1932.12.19,"Yes, today, Dec. 19th, Monday, I have written myself to the verge of total extinction. Praised be I can stop & wallow in coolness & downs, & let the wheels of my mind—how. I beg them to do this—cool & slow & stop altogether. I shall take up Flush again to cool myself. By Heaven, I have written 60,320 words since Oct. 11th. I think this must be far the quickest going of any of my books: comes far ahead of Orlando or The Lighthouse. But then those 60 thousand will have to be sweated & dried into 30 or 40 thousand—a great grind to come. Never mind. I have secured the outline & fixed a shape for the rest. I feel, for the first time, No I mustn’t take risks crossing the road, till the book is done. And though to me it is so important, I receive, at Clive’s—at George, Ring the Bell & Run Away’s—the first of the little pricks which will be so lavishly provided when The Pargiters comes out. Oh but by then I shall have perfected my social technique. I am practising with Eddy, & intend to make further experiments, when opportunity serves, with Logan. Yes, I will be free & entire & absolute & mistress of my life by Oct. 1st 1933. Nobody shall come here on their terms; or hale me off to them on theirs. Oh & I shall write a poets book next. This one, however, releases such a torrent of fact as I did not know I had in me. I must have been observing & collecting these 20 years—since Jacob’s Room anyhow. Such a wealth of things seen present themselves that I cant choose even—hence 60,000 words all about one paragraph. What I must do is to keep control; & not be too sarcastic; & keep the right degree of freedom & reserve. But oh how easy this writing is compared with The Waves! I wonder what the degree of carat gold is in the 2 books. Of course this is external: but there’s a good deal of gold—more than I’d thought—in externality. Anyhow, what care I for my goose feather bed? I’m off to join the raggle taggle gipsies oh! The Gipsies, I say: not Hugh Walpole & Priestley—no.

In truth The Pargiters is first cousin to Orlando, though the cousin in the flesh: Orlando taught me the trick of it. Now—oh but I must stop for 10 days at least—no 14—if not 21 days—now I must compose 1880-1900 chapter which needs skill. But I like applying skill I own. L. is off to the Lanchester’s in a rage. I am going to polish off my jobs: & tomorrow we go.

A very fruitful varied & I think successful autumn—thanks partly to my tired heart: so I could impose terms: & I have never lived in such a race, such a dream, such a violent impulsion & compulsion—scarcely seeing anything but the Pargiters.

[Diary XXII]"
1932.12.23,"This is not the first day of the new year; but the discrepancy may be forgiven. I must write off my dejected rambling misery—having just read over the 30,000 words of Flush & come to the conclusion that they won’t do. Oh what a waste—what a bore! Four months of work, & heaven knows how much reading—not of an exalted kind either—& I cant see how to make anything of it. Its not the right subject for that length: its too slight & too serious. Much good in it but would have to be much better. So here I am two days before Christmas, pitched into one of my grey welters. True, its partly over writing The Pargiters. But I cant get back into Flush, ever, I feel: & L. will be disappointed; & the money loss too—thats a bore. I took it up impetuously after The Waves by way of a change: no forethought in me; & so got landed: it would need a months hard work—& even then I doubt it. In that time I might have done Dryden & Pope. And I’m thus led to begin—no to end the year with a doleful plaint. It is blazing hot; like spring, with the bees on the flowers. Never mind; this is not a reverse of the first order—not at all."
1932.12.31,"This is in fact the last day of 1932, but I am so tired of polishing off Flush—such a pressure on the brain is caused by doing ten pages daily—that I am taking a morning off, & shall use it here, in my lazy way, to sum up the whole of life. By that phrase, one of my colloquialities, I only mean, I wish I could deliver myself of a picture of all my friends, thoughts, doings, projects at this moment. Vita is on the high seas, sailing to America. Our new car came, vicariously, yesterday—we are lent one. And I had a long letter from Ottoline, of sheer affection, & one still longer from Ethel Smyth, of dubious jealousy & supressed temper & love strangled & out bursting. And Anrep wants to put me on the floor of the Bank of England as Clio, &—cards, thanks, catalogues of winter sales. On Monday we go up to Angelica’s party. On Tuesday we come back. And we shall be here till the 14th of Jan. And Miss Scott Johnson doesn’t do. And we are us usual needing manuscripts; the dew pond is filling; the gold fish are dead; it is a clear pale blue eyed winters day; &—&—&—my thoughts turn with excitement to The Pargiters, for I long to feel my sails blow out, & to be careering with Elvira, Maggie & the rest over the whole of human life.

And indeed I cannot sum this up, being tired in my head. I think of Lytton too. Yes, of course this autumn has been a tremendous revelation. You will understand that all impediments suddenly dropped off. It was a great season of liberation. Everything appeared very distinct, amazingly exciting. I had no restrictions whatever, & was thus free to define my attitude with a vigour & certainty I have never known before. I laid about me & cut down the nettles. I said I will no longer be fettered by any artificial tie. I therefore spoke out in my own voice to Eddy & tried to subdue circumscribe Logan. Well—it is always doubtful how far one human being can be free. The ties are not purely artificial. One cannot cut a way absolutely straight. However, I secured a season of intoxicating exhilaration. Nor do I intend to let myself pay for it with the usual black despair. I intend to circumvent that supervening ghost—that which always trails its damp wings behind my glories. I shall be very wary, very adept—as now—writing languidly to avoid a headache. To suppress one self & run freely out in joy, or laughter with impersonal joys & laughters—such is the perfectly infallible & simple prescription.

For example, with Julian & Lettice Ramsay last night—why not simply become fluid in their lives, if my own is dim? And to use ones hands & eyes; to talk to people; to be a straw on the river, now & then—passive, not striving to say this is this. If one does not lie back & sum up & say to the moment, this very moment, stay you are so fair, what will be one’s gain, dying? No: stay, this moment. No one ever says that enough. Always hurry. I am now going in, to see L. & say stay this moment."
1933.01.03,"This is a little out of place, but then so am I. We are up for Angelica’s party last night, & I have half an hour to spend before shooting in the new Lanchester (not ours—one lent) back to Rodmell. We have been there just short of one fortnight, & I ate myself into the heart of print & solitude—so as to adumbrate a headache. And to wipe off the intensity of concentration—trying to re-write that abominable dog Flush in 13 days, so as to be free—oh heavenly freedom—to write The Pargiters,—I insisted upon a night of chatter. Let me see.

I fell into the arms of Nan [Hudson] & Ethel [Sands]—the two discreet ladies. Nan had a banana brown mask; Ethel the head of a Parisian cocotte. I like masks. I like the disorientation they give my feelings (here I lapsed for 5 minutes into Elvira’s thoughts about civilisation—indeed, its a good discipline, this new one, of forcing one’s brain the other way for a time—see how vigorously it spurts back—) Then I was settled with Nan; & she poor woman, tried to conciliate the powers which were then in the ascendant & said she “infinitely preferred this to the Beau Monde. Oh how much hungrier I am for this meal than for my own dinner! Yes, Virginia, I’m a bohemian at heart. I have just slipped into the other. There is a certain charm in it. But our Butler is the most Bohemian of all. And then dear Ethel—” Now stop, I said, you’re going to celebrate the perfections of Ethel. I cant allow that. For I assure you, Ethel’s humanity is mere superficiality—“Oh my dear, I assure you you’re wrong. She has a very subtle sense of society—I haven’t. She gets things from Ldy Oxford for instance, that I dont. If she has a fault it is that she never sees anyones faults, which tends of course to make them—I mean, its a little lacking in salt, that is to me”. While this ambling & pacing went on—I always whip myself up to say something entire I give myself that credit—but its often very silly & something I’ve said before—Ethel was sitting by us, on the models throne talking to Raymond. And we were eating ham & chicken & ices & rolls & pate sandwiches—& drinking wine—Nessa’s commissariat was lavish & opportune—I daresay there were 60—or 40—people there. Wogan drifted up. We talked. I was very polite, because of John. He was very polite. Rosamund I thought a little chill—no, shy I daresay. Wogan said The Waves shd. be filmed: I in my vague way, said V. Isham wants to do it—but she meant to broadcast, & oddly enough, when I came home I found a letter from her saying so. Then W⁠[ogan]. talked about the autumnal Ottoline calling R⁠[osamond]. to her upstairs & leaving him to hear Dryden read by Pipsey [Philip Morrell]: to walk in the garden & get advice about trees & pagodas. W. lives a little—but lives joyously, & I daresay wantonly—in the shadow of R. who, modest I think, is yet a best seller; an American success—a musical, rapt girl or woman: too easily content though with familiar melodies. Wogan wears well cut trousers—was a sporting man—& a red jersey to symbolise that he is now disowned by his father, a painter. R. later got into-talk with L. about John; & was vague, grieved, apologetic, yet sisterly. Couldn’t, I think, put up much defense. And dear old Marjorie performed. My word! she is now an elderly fat woman—grey as a badger, but so stout, so pendulous—so much an old fireside matron for all her witch ways—which are in truth obscene with her peculiar touch of genius in being blatantly obscene. She has few, black, crooked (so it seemed to me) teeth. She opens her mouth, grimaces, claws, paws, stumps, projects, hawks, pirouettes—should have been on the stage—a Marie Lloyd. And Cory, up for his Bohemian night & determined to be Bohemian as he signified by saying in a loud voice under the lee of Nan “My family call him the Arch-Bugger”—Cory was much taken by her, & stretching a long arm I pulled one strand of her hair, & introduced them. She gets moth eaten, she says, in the country: seemed to feel it damp, clayey; is driven in on herself; reads too much; cant escape; has no one to rub up with—yet—Wogan said—is the life & soul of Leicester: plays games with the hunting set—according to him the most barbarous of all people. Children come down with blood on their foreheads for 3 days after a hunt: mustn’t wash it off. Then there was Saxon bowing & smiling in silence like a Chinese mandarin—so I bowed & smiled in silence swaying off my throne to him. “We know each other so well, we smile now” I said, reflecting that I should ask him to dinner; but I doubt if he wants it.

(my 30 minutes is stretching.) L. is talking to Miss [Scott] Johnson, who won’t do. And last night Belsher rang up to say her fur coat was stolen: might she borrow one from me: so up she came, & accused Miss Johnson’s protege an unemployed man who is allowed in; significant of the relations between Miss J. & B.—strained. The coat was worth £30, Miss B. said: too poor to buy another: & this morning she rings up to say she is ill, & so is all her family. What then about Porter? I wonder—that strapping American? Oh the future of the Press—for the millionth time it is melting again.

I daresay this will be my last appearance in this book, because I think I have destroyed this pen, tired my hand, & nothing but thin water comes from my brain, having written so much, so quickly. It is 12.35 on Tuesday January 3rd 1933."
1933.01.05,"I am so delighted with my own ingenuity in having after only ten years or so, made myself, in 5 minutes, a perfect writing board, with pen tray attached, so that I cant ever again fly into a fury bereft of ink & pen at the most critical moment of a writers life & see my sudden sentence dissipate itself all for lack of a pen handy—& besides I’m so glad to be quit of page 100 of Flush—this the third time of writing that Whitechapel scene, & I doubt if its worth it, that I cant help disporting myself on this free blue page, which thank God in heaven, needs no re-writing. It is a wet misty day: my windows out here are all fog. And I daresay we shall drive our new car, though it is still only a substitute, twenty miles or so this afternoon, by way of a test. It is like travelling first instead of third.

Bunny’s new Pochantos is reviewed in the Lit. Sup. this morning, & I augur a great success, I think without any serious pangs of jealousy. But that of course, has yet to be proved. Jealousy may slink out its green paws, being the uncertain fabric I am. But I think not, if only because I’m in sublime reading fettle: seriously I believe that the strain of The Waves weakened my concentration for months—& then all that article compressing for the C.R. I am now at the height of my powers in that line, & have read, with close & powerful attention, some 12 or 15 books since I came here. What a joy—what a sense as of a Rolls Royce engine once more purring its 70 miles an hour in my brain: so that if Bunny’s book is a good one, there will be another stretch of road ahead of me for a few days. What I hitherto have disliked in Bunny is the falsetto. Assuming a mask to speak through: out comes his own voice stylised, mincing, though well articulated & controlled. Lytton’s saying “Ye old Cocke & Balls” of one of them sums up my meaning. I am also encouraged to read by the feeling that I am on the flood of creativeness in The Pargiters—what a liberation that gives one—as if everything added to that torrent—all books become fluid & swell the stream. But I daresay this is a sign only that I’m doing what is rather superficial & hasty & eager. I dont know. I’ve another week of Flush here, & then shall come to grips with my 20 years in one chapter problem. I visualise this book now as a curiously uneven time sequence—a series of great balloons, linked by straight narrow passages of narrative. I can take liberties with the representational form which I could not dare when I wrote Night & Day—a book that taught me much, bad though it may be. And now I must write to N. Darwin about her Jemmy Button. Hampson’s new novel is so bad we are going to advise against publishing it."
1933.01.15,"I have come out here, our last morning, to write letters, so, naturally, I write this book. But then I haven’t written a line these 3 weeks—only typed Flush, which, Heaven be praised, I ‘finished’, almost without inverted commas, yesterday. Ah but my writing Flush has been gradually shoved out, as by a cuckoo born in the nest, by The Pargiters. How odd the mind’s functions are! About a week ago, I began the making up of scenes—unconsciously: saying phrases to myself; & so, for a week, I’ve sat here, staring at the typewriter, & speaking aloud phrases of The Pargiters. This becomes more & more maddening. It will however all be run off in a few days, when I let myself write again.

I am reading Parnell. Yes; but this scene making increases the rate of my heart with uncomfortable rapidity. While I was forcing myself to do Flush my old headache came back—for the first time this autumn. Why should The P.s make my heart jump, why should Flush stiffen the back of my neck? What connection has the brain with the body? Nobody in Harley St could explain, yet the symptoms are purely physical & as distinct as one book is from the other.

Meanwhile, L.’s hired stock has given him some form of itch. He picks what he thinks black insects off his neck—I can imagine nothing more terrible than to have insects under ones skin—I should see them parading in squads. Now I will try to call in my mind from The P.s, & attach it to Mr Shaw Desmond, to Tom, to Holtby, to K. Furse; but not I think to E. Smyth.

And I was forgetting to say that The Deluge [Lanchester car] came yesterday. It was expected at 1.15. At 3 Julian & Angelica arrived, at 4 as AJ. were going to the shop to buy sweets L. pruning, cried out its come. And it had gone. It swept up the village past us, but returned. In colour & shape it is beyond the wildest dreams—I mean it is elegant green silver beautifully compact modelled firm & not too rich—not a money car. We drove it to Lewes, & shall now take it to London; & so, I say, write letters. A cloudy, goose wing day with silver shields."
1933.01.19,"It must be confessed that The Pargiters are like cuckoos in my nest—which should be Flush. I have only 50 pages to correct & send to Mabel [typist]; & these cursed scenes & dialogues will go on springing up in my head; & after correcting one page, I sit mooning for 20 minutes. I daresay this will increase the blood pressure when I come to write. But it is a tiresome bewildering distraction now.

Then we began London briskly with Leonard’s lice—his incurable & disgusting skin disease. We went to a Wimpole Street specialist—happily his house was almost opposite Flush’s so that I could count the storeys & verify the knockers—its true they have none, but the houses are very well pointed—while L. & Elly [Dr Rendel] were inside the consulting room. Finally the dr. said L. had never been bitten at all. And so, as the day wore on, the incurable disease was cured.

Then came Plomer & Marjorie [Strachey] to dine; & we went to Sadler’s Wells & saw Pomona with Nessa’s designs—dresses, scenery—all very pale & bright—I mean Fra Angelico against a background of Cassis—but dear (said to be from dieu) knows I cant keep my wits at the ballet; cant throw a ring round so many wild horses—music, dancing, decoration: & so hop on my perch, & merely make parrot noises of appreciation—when, at Fitzroy Street [Vanessa’s studio], we all had hot sausages. Large dishes of hot, writhing sausages, looking indecent, like black snakes amorously intertwined, were handed round. There was Bunny, flushed with triumph (I sent back Pocahontas unread—cant read with my head stuffed with Pargiters) & I said I had dreamt I was in his arms, so he took me in his arms—pale phantom of old love—the love of men & women—in the pantry. Roger was there,—is he older, less volatile? He makes his signal to Helen sooner than of old & drives off in that blind bull of a car—it charges with its head down—but not before, as I maliciously observed, he had cross-questioned me about his lectures. This insistent egotism has its charm. I never ask him to read my essays.

So home in the new car."
1933.01.21,"Well, Flush lingers on & I cannot despatch him. Thats the sad truth. I always see something I could press tighter, or enwrap more completely. There’s no trifling with words—cant be done: not when they’re to stand ‘for ever’. So I am battening down my Pargiters say till Wednesday—it shant be later, I swear. And now I grow doubtful of the value of those figures. I’m afraid of the didactic; perhaps it was only that spurious passion that made me rattle away before Christmas. Anyhow I enjoyed it immensely, & shall again—oh to be free, in fiction, making up my scenes again—however discreetly. Such is my cry this very fine cold January morning.

In 10 minutes Angelica comes & we go to Don Giovanni at Sadler’s Wells. I have seen this week besides Plomer & Marjorie, Cotter Ludby who has been found in a Police Court, strapped to a bed in St Paneras Infirmary—been raging mad, as I can believe—& Robson & Ethel Smyth. Mrs Hunter is dead. Died standing eating drinking dressing penniless, ruined discredited, having got through 40,000 a year, not all of her own; but they say she was a great hostess & all is forgiven—rightly I think, though in another class she would have been in prison. Such is the price we pay for our great hostesses. Witness Sibyl Colefax working in a shop."
1933.01.26,"Well, Flush is, I swear, despatched. Nobody can say I dont take trouble with my little stories. And now, having bent my mind for 5 weeks sternly this way, I must unbend them the other—the Pargiter way. No critic ever gives full weight to the desire of the mind for change. Talk of being many sided—naturally one must go the other way. Now if I ever had the wits to go into the Shakespeare business I believe one would find the same law there—tragedy comedy, & so on. Looming behind the P.s I can just see the shape of pure poetry beckoning me. But the P.s is a delightful solid possession to be enjoyed tomorrow. How bad I shall find it.

Not a letter has come my way these 2 days (oh but several parcels) & I therefore lapse into the healing sanctuary of anonymity. I think The Beau Monde has given me up—Ethel Sands is undoubtedly & no doubt reasonably annoyed with what Logan has chosen to purvey of my letters. So I say I will rout further in the bran pie; & go to my Club & meet young working women. I am going to learn Italian. Bianca my unknown adorer is to teach me. And I am to have Holtby to tea today. So perhaps I can make do without Chelsea.

I have bought several things freely & cheaply for the first time at the Winter Sales. Yesterday at Mar⁠[shall] & Snelgrove’s I said, by way of a joke to the girl, If that coats rubbed, they should sell it me for £3. And took me seriously. I heard an acrid conversation behind a screen. The girl was a greenhorn. You’ve no right to tell customers the coat is rubbed. Thats what its reduced for & so on. To my surprise my 3.19.6—formerly £5.10 coat was given me—all for my joke—for £3.10. Oh dear—the world of shops!"
1933.02.02,"No we are not deserted by the world—oh dear no: dinner Mary Monday; dinner here Friday; James & Alix dinner Wednesday—to talk about Lytton’s things, says James. “I want to see you both alone”. Hope [Mirrlees], will you come to dinner again? Ethel, will you lunch at Woking; Margaret West to tea on Sunday—a possible Press manager (S⁠[cott].J⁠[ohnson]. to go) & Bianca to tea today: on top of which we have to decide about 35 Gordon Square on Saturday. By chance, Martins [estate agent] sent us an order; we saw it; well, it might do—Its a great big corner house; a warren of a basement; a studio, a bad dining room & kitchen; but great rooms looking on to the square; & quiet, with gardens behind; with a side door, so that publishing is possible—they say: altogether, I expect we shall take it for 9 years, at much the same rent as this, & the Pritchards will share. Not that I much want a move in March, with The Pargiters on my hands. I am going however to work largely, spaciously, fruitfully on that book. Today I finished—rather more completely than usual—revising the first chapter. I’m leaving out the interchapters—compacting them in the text; & project an appendix of dates. A good idea?

And Galsworthy died two days ago, it suddenly struck me, walking just now by the Serpentine after calling on Mrs W⁠[oolf]. (who’s been dying—is recovering) with the gulls opening their scimitars—masses of gulls. Galsworthy’s dead: & A. Bennett told me he simply couldn’t stick Galsworthy. Had to praise Jack’s books to Mrs G. But I could say what I liked against Galsworthy. That stark man lies dead."
1933.02.17,"I steal time from my Italian verbs. Yes I think I know them. I am having 2 lessons weekly from Bianca; she suggests three; but as I have to get in Ethel &c. Oh yesterday it was like being a snail shell & having a thrush tapping till the beak of her incessant voice broke my skull. I always say “Poor old lady”. For I rather think she came all the way from Woking for this dry brittle hour. I am half ashamed—yet cant see that I’m to blame. And now she goes to Bath for 5 weeks—yes, to my relief I own. Because I cant bear being a snail shell. And she is so positive, so insistent. Being Ethel is so habitual to her.

I’m launched again in The Pargiters, in this blank season of the year—Nessa at Charleston, Clive in Jamaica, Roger in Tangier—Vita in America—which of my friends is left. But Desmond dined the night before last; Morgan came in last night; Holtby today—so there’s no lack of people. Now of course the P.s runs a little slack. This fact recording is too flat."
1933.03.25,"It is an utterly corrupt society I have just remarked, speaking in the person of Elvira Pargiter, & I will take nothing that it can give me &c &c: now, as Virginia Woolf, I have to write—oh dear me what a bore—to the Vice Chancellor of Manchester Un⁠[ivers]⁠ty & say that I refuse to be made a Doctor of Letters. And to Lady Simon, who has been urgent in the matter, & asks us to stay. Lord knows how I’m to put Elvira’s language into polite journalese. What an odd coincidence! that real life should provide precisely the situation I was writing about! I hardly know which I am, or where: Virginia or Elvira; in the Pargiters or outside. We dined with Susan Lawrence two nights ago. A Mrs Stocks of Man⁠[cheste]⁠r U⁠[niversit]⁠y was there. How delighted my husband will be to give you your degree in July! she began. And had rattled off a great deal about the delight of Manchester in seeing me honoured, before I had to pluck up courage & say, But I wont take it. After that there was a general argument, with the Nevinsons (Evelyn Sharp), Susan Lawrence &c. They all said they would take a degree from a University though not an honour from the state. They made me feel a little silly, priggish & perhaps extreme: but only superficially. Nothing would induce me to connive at all that humbug. Nor would it give me, even illicitly, any pleasure. I really believe that Nessa & I—she went with me, & used my arguments about the silliness of honours for women—are without the publicity sense. Now for the polite letters. Dear Vice Chancellor—"
1933.03.28,"The polite letters have been sent. So far I have had, nor could have had any answer. No, thank Heaven, I need not emerge from my fiction in July to have a tuft of fur put on my head. It is the finest spring ever known—soft, hot, blue, misty. The trees all out, the other day in the park, when we took Bunny’s child to Hayling Island. It was a June day. Poor Ray like a slum woman, so gaunt, so grim. He had a boat. It was cold on the beach—the Island is spotted with houses, like the rest of the world. And then down to Maidenhead in June weather—more bungalows. And dinner with Ly Rhondda. I felt her a disappointed woman. Should have had 10 children perhaps. She was sitting alone, shawled dowdy in an old Hampstead half [?] flat with a garden with great trees. She is what they call, I expect, ‘inhibited’—something tentative furtive. Discussed Time & Tide &c. She lives for T. & T. but is a little under the thumb of Mr Ellis Roberts. Then on to Clive; back from Jamaica. “The steward came in; & was surprised to find a young lady stark naked brushing her teeth.” True Clive. Julian has failed to get his fellowship, & thinks, or Nessa thinks, of Burma."
1933.04.06,"Oh I’m so tired! I’ve written myself out over The Pargiters this last lap. I’ve brought it down to Elvira in bed—the scene I’ve had in my mind ever so many months, but I cant write it now. Its the turn of the book. It needs a great shove to swing it round on its hinges. As usual, doubts rush in. Isnt it all too quick, too thin, too surface bright? Well, I’m too jaded to crunch it up, if thats so; & so shall bury it for a month—till we’re back from Italy perhaps; & write on Goldsmith &c meanwhile. Then seize on it fresh, & dash it off in June July August September. Four months should finish the first draght—100,000 words I think. 50,000 words written in 5 months—my record

This is a time of ending. I’ve ever so many people to see. Ott tomorrow. The people of Manchester have written, very politely, with additional respect for me, because I dont take honours. And I’m going to Hugo [Language Institute] to hear Sigrun Martyn talk Italian. Mine is hopeless. She dashes on about her car—I limp & fumble. Bianca is in Italy. Nessa & the others at Charleston. Last night Lord Olivier, a jolly old bore, has been a dog in his day, dined here. And Pippa came in later—grown very thick, but looks unhappy. And we went to Bedford [travelling books] on Tuesday in this June weather & to St Neots & saw the carved ceiling.

I began the four great vols of Goldsmith this morning."
1933.04.13,"No I have worked myself too dry this time. There is not one idea left in the orange. But we go [to Rodmell] today, & I shall sun, with only a few books. No I will not write; I will not see people. A little nip from Gissing in the TLS. which I must answer. But indeed I cant find words—use the wrong ones—thats my state: the familiar state after these 3 months writing—what fun that book is to me! And pressing in Italian, & seeing a mint of people—the state I say is quite familiar; & will vanish; yes, & then there’s Italy to come. I have my new corduroys; & Mr Ronald Murray is appointed my dress maker.

Sibyl lunched—one hears her dry claws tapping the perch as she hops—then Pernel, ample gentle silver grey, & very—what is the word?—there I go forgetting. The word I like—integrity. Now I must collect my things. Nelly by the way touchingly friendly. Age is like lichen on roofs—knowing people I mean: gives our relationship some yellow red glow, so I think. Ann & Judy dined here. Ann at the stage where she likes action, rather than detective plays. Judy as candid as a boy of 10. And I want to write on Goldsmith, Halifax & Turgenev. And Ethel is “cutting the painter” (between us—for the 100th time). And—no, I must really learn a smoother narrative style."
1933.04.25,"No, we didn’t see nobody at Rodmell. Lydia & Maynard arrived before we had been there half an hour; & we dined with them, & were invited to the royal party at Shelleys—Mr Hambro being the uncle of the proprietor; & the friend of Timmy & of the Gleichens; & they had crab, but the chicken was tough, so we did not go.

Thats all over—our ten days: & I wrote daily, almost, at Goldsmith—dont much see the point of my Goldsmiths & so on—& read Goldsmith, & so on. Yes; I should now be correcting Flush proofs—I doubt that little book to some extent: but I’m in a doubting mood: the scrambled mood of transience, for on Friday 5th we go to Siena; so I cant settle, & make up my story, in which lies permanence. And as usual I want to seethe myself in something new—to break the mould of habit entirely, & get that escape which Italy & the sun & the lounging & the indifference of all that to all this brings about. I rise, like a bubble out of a bottle. And my eyes hurt, & I must go & see Mr Doggett—Sheppard’s Johnny—today. And have 7 Italian lessons; & see Vita, Christabel, &c.

But The Pargiters. I think this will be a terrific affair. I must be bold & adventurous. I want to give the whole of the present society—nothing less: facts, as well as the vision. And to combine them both. I mean, The Waves going on simultaneously with Night & Day. Is this possible? At present I have assembled 50,000 words of ‘real’ life: now in the next 50 I must somehow comment; Lord knows how—while keeping the march of events. The figure of Elvira is the difficulty. She may become too dominant. She is to be seen only in relation to other things. This should give I think a great edge to both of the realities—this contrast. At present, I think the run of events is too fluid & too free. It reads thin; but lively. How am I to get the depth without becoming static? But I like these problems, & anyhow theres a wind & a vigour in this naturalness. It should aim at immense breadth & immense intensity. It should include satire, comedy, poetry, narrative, & what form is to hold them all together? Should I bring in a play, letters, poems? I think I begin to grasp the whole. And its to end with the press of daily normal life continuing. And there are to be millions of ideas but no preaching—history, politics, feminism, art, literature—in short a summing up of all I know, feel, laugh at, despise, like, admire hate & so on."
1933.04.28,"A mere note. We got out of the car last night & began walking down to the Serpentine. A summer evening. Chestnuts in their crinolines, bearing tapers: grey green water & so on. Suddenly L. bore off; & there was Shaw, dwindled shanks, white beard; striding along. We talked, by a railing, for 15 mins. He stood with his arms folded, very upright, leaning back; teeth gold tipped. Just come from the dentist, & ‘lured’ out for a walk by the weather. Very friendly. That is his art, to make one think he likes one. A great spurt of ideas. “You forget that an aeroplane is like a car—it bumps—We went over the great wall—saw a little dim object in the distance. Of course the tropics are the place. The Ceylon⁠[?] people are the original human beings—we are smudged copies. I caught the Chinese looking at us with horror—that we should be human beings! Of course the tour cost thousands; yet to see us, you’d think we hadnt the price of the fare to Hampton Court. Lots of old spinsters had saved up for years to come. Oh but my publicity! Its terrifying. An hours bombardment at every port. I made the mistake of accepting [blank] invitation. I found myself on a platform with the whole university round me. They began shouting We want Bernard Shaw. So I told them that every man at 21 must be a revolutionary. After that of course the police imprisoned them by dozens. I want to write an article for the Herald pointing out what Dickens said years ago about the folly of Parliament. Oh I could only stand the voyage by writing. I’ve written 3 or 4 books. I like to give the public full weight. Books should be sold by the pound. What a nice little dog. But aren’t I keeping you & making you cold (touching my arm)—Two men stopped along the path to look. Off he strode again on his dwindled legs. I said Shaw likes us. L. thinks he likes nobody. What will they think of Shaw in 50 years? He is 76 he said; too old for the tropics."
1933.04.29,"Last night—to relieve myself for a moment from correcting that silly book Flush,—oh what a waste of time—I will record Bruno Walter. He is a swarthy, fattish, man; not at all smart. Not at all the “great conductor”. He is a little Slav, a little Semitic. He is very nearly mad; that is, he cant get ‘the poison’ as he called it of Hitler out of him. “You must not think of the Jews” he kept on saying “You must think of this awful reign of intolerance. You must think of the whole state of the world. It is terrible—terrible. That this meanness, that this pettiness, should be possible! Our Germany—which I loved—with our tradition—our culture—We are now a disgrace.” Then he told us how you cant talk above a whisper. There are spies everywhere. He had to sit in the window of his hotel in Leipzig? a whole day, telephoning. All the time soldiers were marching. They never stop marching. And on the wireless, between the turns, they play military music. Horrible horrible! He hopes for the monarchy as the only hope. He will never go back there. His orchestra had been in existence for 150 years: but it is the spirit of the whole that is awful. We must band together. We must refuse to meet any German. We must say that they are uncivilised. We will not trade with them or play with them—we must make them feel themselves outcasts—not by fighting them; by ignoring them. Then he swept off to music. He has the intensity—genius?—which makes him live every thing he feels. Described conducting: must know every player."

Yes, I thought: I will make a note of that face—the face of the woman stitching a very thin, lustrous green silk at a table in the restaurant where we lunched at Vienne. She was like fate—a consummate mistress of all the arts of self preservation: hair rolled & lustrous; eyes so nonchalant; nothing could startle her; there she sat stitching her green silk with people going & coming all the time; she not looking, yet knowing, fearing nothing, expecting nothing—a perfectly equipped middle class French woman.

At Carpentras last night there was the little servant girl with honest eyes, hair brushed in a flop, & one rather black tooth. I felt that life would crush her out inevitably. Perhaps 18. not more; yet on the wheel, without hope; poor, not weak but mastered—yet not enough mastered but to desire furiously travel, for a moment, a car. Ah but I am not rich she said to me—which her cheap little stockings & shoes showed anyhow. Oh how I envy you—able to travel. You like Carpentras? But the wind blows ever so hard. You’ll come again? Thats the bell ringing. Never mind. Come over here & look at this. No, I’ve never seen anything like it. Ah yes, she always likes the English (‘She’ was the other maid, with hair like some cactus in erection). Yes I always like the English she said. The odd little honest face, with the black tooth, will stay on at Carpentras I suppose: will marry? will become one of those stout black women who sit in the door knitting? No: I foretell for her some tragedy; because she had enough mind to envy us the Lanchester."
1933.05.11,"Rapallo

Yesterday there was Miss Cotton. She is one of the army of spinsters, on half or quarter pay. She finds she can live at Diano Marina for 8/- a day. Her friends say But what is there to do? She says, oh there are the beauties of nature. She burst out, directly she came in to dinner, dressed in greenish dressing gown: by her side the dour Miss Thread. How was France? Was it cheap? Oh it was Liberty Hall here. Then she described the wife, the husband, of the inn: & the servants; & how there had once been an Earthquake. Meanwhile came in the 2 guests [?] in evening dress, the deaf lady & the voluble; also the powdered white lady with the red scarf: & after dinner—they often give us asparagus, she said—& they had their own bottles of wine—the two parties settled in at their own tables—where they are now & played bridge. Now this half pay spinster will dwindle on, beside the sea under the mountain, chatting, till she dies.

No we dont like the French Riviera, or the Italian much; but if it has to be, Rapallo does it best: its bay stretched with gold silk this evening, humming scented villas; all orange blossom. Quiet women reading to children, little boats, high cliffs; a sauntering indolent luxurious evening place, where one might spend ones last penny; grown old.

But we dont like these villas—like the Bussys’—laid like eggs on ledges, so that you cant go up or down but must merely sit, & for ever behold the sea & the roof of the Casino. Dorothy & Janie taking their coffee like ladies in a perfectly neat, spaced, yellow room with a large leaved tree outside;—the tree Dorothy & Simon planted 30 years ago. But we dont wish to live here, shredding out our days, in these scented villas, sauntering round the harbour."

Yes Shelley chose better than Max Beerbohm. He chose a harbour; a bay; & his home, with a balcony, on which Mary stood, looks out across the sea. Sloping sailed boats were coming in this morning—a windy little town, of high pink & yellow Southern houses, not much changed I suppose; very full of the breaking of waves, very much open to the sea; & the rather desolate house standing with the sea just in front. Shelley, I suppose, bathed, walked sat on the beach there; & Mary & Mrs Williams had their coffee on the balcony. I daresay the clothes & the people were much the same. At any rate, a very good great man’s house in its way. What is the word for full of the sea? Cant think tonight, sky high in a bedroom at the Nettuno in Pisa, much occupied by French tourists. The Arno swimming past with the usual coffee coloured foam. Walked in the Cloisters; this is true Italy, with the old dusty smell; people swarming in the streets; under the—what is the word for—I think the word for a street that has pillars is Arcade. Shelley’s house waiting by the sea, & Shelley not coming, & Mary & Mrs Williams watching from the balcony & then Trelawney coming from Pisa, & burning the body on the shore—thats in my mind. All the colours here are white bluish marble against a very light saturated sky. The tower leaning prodigiously. Clerical beggar at the door in a mock fantastic leather hat. The clergy walking.

It was in these cloisters—Campo Santo—that L. & I walked 21 years ago & met the Palgraves & I tried to hide behind the pillars. And now we come in our car; & the Palgraves—are they dead, or very old? Now at any rate we have left the black country, the bald necked vulture country with its sprinkling of redroofed villas. This is the Italy one used to visit in a railway train with Violet Dickinson—taking the hotel bus."
1933.05.13,"Siena

Today we saw the most beautiful of views & the melancholy man. The view was like a line of poetry that makes itself; the shaped hill, all flushed with reds & greens; the elongated lines, cultivated every inch; old, wild, perfectly said, once & for all: & I walked up to a group & said What is that village? It called itself [blank in ms]; & the woman with the blue eyes said wont you come to my house & drink? She was famished for talk. Four or five of them buzzed round us, & I made a Ciceronian speech, about the beauty of the country. But I have no money to travel with, she said, wringing her hands. We would not go to her house—or cottage on the side of the hill, & shook hands; hers were dusty; she wanted to keep them from me; but we all shook hands, & I wished we had gone to her house, in the loveliest of all landscapes. Then, lunching by the river among the ants, we met the melancholy man. He had five or six little fish in his hands, which he had caught in his hands. We said it was very beautiful country; & he said no, he preferred the town. He had been to Florence; no, he did not like the country. He wanted to travel, but had no money: worked at some village; no he did not like the country, he repeated, with his gentle cultivated voice; no theatres, no pictures, only perfect beauty. I gave him 2 cigarettes; at first he refused, then offered us his 6 or 7 little fish. But we could not cook them at Siena, we said. No, he agreed; & so we parted.

It is all very well, saying one will write notes but writing is a very difficult art. That is one has always to select; & I am too sleepy, & hence merely run sand through my fingers. Writing is not in the least an easy art. Thinking what to write, it seems easy; but the thought evaporates, runs hither & thither. Here we are in the noise of Siena—the vast tunnelled arched stone town, swarmed over by chattering shrieking children."
1933.05.14,"Yes I am reading—skipping—the Sacred Fount [by Henry James]—about the most inappropriate of all books for this din—sitting by the open window, looking across heads & heads & heads—all Siena parading in gray & pink & the cars hooting. How finely run along those involuted threads? I dont—thats the answer. I let ’em break. I only mark that the sign of a masterly writer is his power to break his mould callously. None of H. J.’s timid imitators have the vigour, once they’ve spun their sentence, to smash it. He has some native juice—figure; has driven his spoon deep into some stew of his own—some swarming mixture. That—his vitality—his vernacular—his pounce & grip & swing always spring fresh upon me, if at the same time I ask how could anyone, outside an orchis in a greenhouse, fabricate such an orchid’s dream! Oh these Edwardian ladies with pale hair, these tailored “my dear men”! Yet compared to that vulgar old brute Creevey—L. is here bitten by a flea—H.J. is muscular, lean. No doubt the society of the Regent—the smell of brandy & bones, the painted velvet Lawrence women—the general laxity & lustiness & vulgarity are here at their superlative. Of course the Shelleys the Wordsworths the Coleridges existed on the other side of the hedge. But when it comes gushing out of Creevey’s page, its for all the world like—something between Buckingham Palace, Brighton; & the Queen’s own italic style—so uncurbed, so weak: & how can one hope for or care for a single person? There’s all the dreary Lords & Ladies ogling & over eating; & plush & gilt; & the Princess & the Prince—I think dissolution & obesity taking hold of the 18th Century & swelling it into a puffball efflorescence, 1860 is considerably more to the point."
1933.05.15,"This should be all description—I mean of the little pointed green hills; & the white oxen, & the poplars, & the cypresses, & the sculptured shaped infinitely musical, flushed green land from here to Abbazia—that is where we went today; & couldn’t find it, & asked one after another of the charming tired peasants, but none had been 4 miles beyond their range, until we came to the stone breaker, & he knew. He could not stop work to come with us, because the inspector was coming tomorrow. And he was alone, alone, all day with no one to talk to. So was the aged Maria at the Abbazio. And she mumbled & slipped her words, as she showed us into the huge bare stone building; mumbled & mumbled, about the English—how beautiful they were. Are you a Contessa? she asked me. But she didnt like Italian country either. They seem stinted, dried up; like grasshoppers, & with the manners of impoverished gentle people; sad, wise, tolerant, humorous. There was the man with the mule. He let the mule gallop away down the road. We are welcome, because we might talk; they draw round & discuss us after we’re gone. Crowds of gentle kindly boys & girls always come about us, & wave & touch their hats. And nobody looks at the view—except us—at the Euganean, bone white, this evening: then there’s a ruddy red farm or two; & light islands swimming here & there in the sea of shadow—for it was very showery—then there are the black stripes of cypresses round the farms; like fur ridges; & the poplars, & the streams & the nightingales singing & sudden gusts of orange blossom; & white alabaster oxen, with swinging chins—great flaps of white leather hanging under their noses—& infinite emptiness, loneliness, silence: never a new house, or a village; but only the vineyards & the olive trees, where they have always been. The hills go pale blue, washed very sharp & soft on the sky; hill after hill;"

Its a queer thing that I write a date. Perhaps in this disoriented life one thinks, if I can say what day it is, then … Three dots to signify I dont know what I mean. But we have been driving all day from Lerici over the Apennines, & it is now cold, cloistral, highly uncomfortable in a vast galleried Italian inn [Croce Bianca], so ill provided with chairs that now at this present moment we are squatted, L. in a hard chair by his bed, I on the bed, in order to take advantage of the single light which burns between us. L. is writing directions to the Press. I am about to read Goldoni.

Lerici is hot & blue & we had a room with a balcony. There were Misses [?] & Mothers—misses [?] who had lost all chance of life long ago, & could with a gentle frown, a frown of mild sadness, confront a whole meal—arranged for the English—in entire silence, dressed as if for cold Sunday supper in Wimbledon. Then there’s the retired Anglo-Indian, who takes shall we say Miss Toutchet for a walk, a breezy red faced man, very fond of evensong at the Abbey. She goes to the Temple; where ‘my brother’ has rooms. Et cetera Et cetera.

Of the Apennines I have nothing to say—save that up on the top theyre like the inside of a green umbrella: spine after spine: & clouds caught on the point of the stick. And so down to Parma; hot, stony, noisy; with shops that dont keep maps; & so on along a racing road to Piacenza, at which we find ourselves now at 6 minutes to 9 P.M. This of course is the rub of travelling—this is the price paid for the sweep & the freedom—the dusting of our shoes & careering off tomorrow—& eating our lunch on a green plot beside a deep cold stream. It will all be over this day week—comfort & discomfort; & the zest & rush that no engagements, hours, habits give. Then we shall take them up again with more than the zest of travelling."
1933.05.22,"To write to keep off sleep—that is the exalted mission of tonight—tonight sitting at the open window of a secondrate inn in Draguignan—with plane trees outside, the usual single noted bird, the usual loudspeaker. Everyone in France motors on Sunday; then sleeps it off at night. The hotel keepers are gorged, & scarcely stop playing cards. But Grasse was too plethoric—we came on here late. We leave here early. I dip into Creevey; L. into Golden Bough. We long for bed. This is the tax for travelling—these sticky uncomfortable hotel nights—sitting on hard chairs under the lamp. But the seduction works as we start—to Aix tomorrow—so home—And ‘home’ becomes a magnet, for I cant stop making up The P.s: cant live without that intoxicant—though this is the loveliest & most distracting alternative. But I’m full of holiday—& want work—ungrateful that I am!—& yet I want the hills near Fabbria too, & the hills near Siena—but no other hills—not these black & green violent monotonous Southern hills—We saw poor Lawrence’s Phoenix picked out in coloured pebbles at Vence today, among all the fretted lace tombs."
1933.05.23,"I have just said to myself if it were possible to write, those white sheets would be the very thing, not too large or too small. But I do not wish to write, except as an irritant.

This is Vienne, it is roasting hot—hotter & hotter it gets—& we are driving through France; & its Tuesday & we cross on Friday & this strange interval of travel of sweeping away from habitations & habits will be over. On & on we go—through Aix, through Avignon, on & on, under arches of leaves, over bare sandy roads, under grey black hills with castles, beside vines: & I’m thinking of The Pargiters; & L. is driving; & when we come to poplars, we get out & lunch by the river; & then on; & take a cup of tea by the river, fetch our letters, learn that Lady Cynthia Mosley is dead; picture the scene; wonder at death; & drowse & doze in the heat, & decide to sleep here—hotel de la Poste; & read another letter, & learn that the Book Society will probably take Flush, & speculate what we shall do if we have 1,000 or £2,000 to spend. And what would these little burghers of Vienne, who are drinking coffee do, with that sum, I ask? The girl is a typist; the young men clerks. For some reason they start discussing hotels at Lyons, I think; & they havent a penny piece between them; & all the men go into the urinal, one sees their legs; & the Morocco soldiers go in their great cloaks; & the children play ball, & people stand lounging, & everything becomes highly pictorial, composed, legs, in particular—the odd angles they make, & the people dining in the hotel; & the queer air it all has, since we shall leave early tomorrow, of something designing [?] Vienne on my mind, significantly. Now the draw of home, & freedom, & no packing tells on us—oh to sit in an arm chair, & read & not to have to ask for Eau Minerale with which to brush our teeth!

Yes but of all things coming home from a holiday is undoubtedly the most damned. Never was there such aimlessness, such depression. Cant read, write or think. Theres no climax here. Comfort yes: but the coffee’s not so good as I expected. And my brain is extinct—literally hasnt the power to lift a pen. What one must do is to set it—my machine I mean—on the rails & give it a push. Lord—how I pushed yesterday to make it start running along Goldsmith again. Theres that half finished article. Lord Salisbury said something about dished up speeches being like the cold remains of last nights supper. I see white grease on the pages of my article. Today its a little warmer—tepid meat: a slab of cold mutton. Its coldish, dullish here. Yes, but I hear the clock tick, & suspect, though I must not look, that the wheels are just beginning to turn on the rails. We go to Monks House for Whitsun, which is Monday—the suburban, the diminished Monks House. No, I cant look at The Pargiters. Its an empty snail shell. And I’m empty with a cold slab of a brain. Never mind. I shall dive head foremost into The Pargiters. And now I shall make my mind run along Italian—whats his name—Goldoni. A few verbs I think.

It occurs to me that this state, my depressed state, is the state in which most people usually are."
1933.05.31,"I think I have now got to the point where I can write for 4 months straight ahead at The Pargiters. Oh the relief—the And I am at once called out to draw lots in our Derby sweepstake. No favourite this year they say. physical relief! I feel as if I cd. hardly any longer keep back—that my brain is being tortured by always butting against a blank wall—I mean Flush, Goldsmith, motoring through Italy: now, tomorrow, I mean to run it off. And suppose only nonsense comes? The thing is to be venturous, bold, to take every possible fence. One might introduce plays, poems, letters, dialogues: must get the round, not only the flat. Not the theory only. And conversation; argument. How to do that will be one of the problems. I mean intellectual argument in the form of art: I mean how give ordinary waking Arnold Bennett life the form of art? These are rich hard problems for my 4 months ahead. And I dont know my own gifts at the moment. I’m disoriented completely after 4 weeks holiday—no 3—but tomorrow we go to Rodmell again. And I must fill up the chinks with reading—& dont want to settle down to books—

Well, now I have to go up to Murray about my dress: & theres Ethel round the corner; but no letters; disorganisation from Whitsun again. I thought, driving through Richmond last night, something very profound about the synthesis of my being: how only writing composes it: how nothing makes a whole unless I am writing; now I have forgotten what seemed so profound. The rhododendron like coloured glass mounds at Kew. Oh the agitation, oh the discomfort of this mood."
1933.06.08,"Very well: the old Pargiters are beginning to run off: & I say oh to be done. I mean, writing is effort: writing is despair: & yet of course t’other day in the grilling heat at Rodmell, I admit that the perspective—this I think was something like my profound thought at Richmond—shifts into focus: yes: the proportion is right; though I at the top suffer strain, suffer, as this morning grim despair & shall O Lord when it comes to re-writing, suffer an intensity of anguish ineffable (the word only means one cant express it); holding the thing—all the things—the innumerable things—together.

We burst ‘the proportion’—I’m amused to compare the thing done with this inner oddity—& went to Leonards Lee, where I saw Nelly Cecil. She escaped—flying old white attenuated: I couldnt summon force to stop her. And she vanished. Violet was in the offing.

Bowen tomorrow, Shaws, Bussys, Camargo; & now, instantly B⁠[arbara]. Hutchinson, to ask a favour, then to hat shop & Nelly Cecil."
1933.06.16,"Anrep coming in half an hour—10-10—so I cant even pretend to settle down to write. (Elvira scene finished). Oh yesterday! Oh yesterday!

Figure to yourself lunch on a hot day at the Shaws. Long narrow room overlooking river & white sepulchral buildings. The Binyons. He a plethoric bolt eyed congested little man; she, washy watery. Mrs Shaw small gimleteyed. In comes Shaw, alert for business, but not in the mood. No one in the mood. Lunch in another long narrow room. Unreal hotel lunch, butlers. Service Kitchen. Shaw’s paddle actually out of the water. Cutting no ice. Had to make a speech to friends of the Nat. Libraries that afternoon; didnt know what their object was; but hoped to say something unpleasant about the conference. And I talked. And I said This is d—d dull. I said it at intervals. Nothing flourished. Every saying died as spoken. All I retrieved was: Shaw does not visualise. I think of the sharp key as brass [?]—thats all. I never see my characters. I feel them in another way. Also, he had been sounded about the O. M. Baldwin said, he’ll only guy us. “I said I have already conferred the Order of Merit on myself”. Stories—about China: some he’d told us already. L.’s hand clattered. Story about his fathers love, which I share, of anti-climax. Throw them all into the Liffey—of his ancestors bones, when they wanted to make a new church. And I kept saying no the drug won’t work. Never once did it work; & we were all glad—Shaw glad—when Mrs S. whose mild babble is continuous—moved; & we never sat down, but had one look at the river, & Shaw escorted us along the black & white passage—very jaunty, upright—sea green eyes red face to the lift. A man of perfect poise—spring—agility—never to me interesting—no poet, but what an efficient, adept, trained arch & darter! His wires, his spring, at 76 entirely astonishing. And the hands flung out in gesture: he has the power to make the world his shape—to me not a beautiful shape—thats all. So home.

Very hot. Very hot. Had to write a letter for M. Fry about opening Squares. At 3.20 Anrep—to Ott’s. Ott in blue & red muslin—dangling earrings. What is it? Our affection for you Ott: we wish you to lunch——Oh dear, no I couldnt, I couldnt. Philip come & protect me!! Enter P. rather moth eaten. I am entirely on Ott’s side. Publicity. Too like Jack Squire. Besides, we still see our friends. And Clive has done very well without us. Do you think we are over? And so on—rather suspicious, rather hurt, rather on the high horse. And Ott genuinely disliking the ceremony. And Boris genuinely anxious expostulatory, deliberate rotund—grasping his hat & making a speech—determined. And P. saying, rather with intent, Ott has been at death’s door (yes, & we were none of us very kind then) & now, as you dont realise, cant stand any strain. Oh but we arent suggesting that she should give more parties—(And you’ll never come to parties she does give. This was sub-acute). Anyhow we walked up to T⁠[avistock].S⁠[quare]. with her—she to have her feet tended—& then B⁠[oris]. so he said, overcame her & kissed her in the street. So back here Then the wallet with the pass to the Pullman Cars picked up in the street. Then Ethel—oh & I was dumb, chill, completely insentient; & she tried to stage a quarrel & failed—failed, poor old woman, in all her effects—with the pinks too—was very unattractive—felt it—suggested going. Did I care? No. I could feel nothing, was dazed, impotent, so led her down the stairs, she, perhaps, suffering, perhaps not—& off she went, & I sank at last—at last—into silence. For had we not had Barbara Hutchinson twice, about her lover: had I not signed books, & gone to tea with Nelly Cecil, & picked up my ears with Lord Bob—& then the dinner with Bunny—taciturn, monolithic—& E⁠[lizabe]⁠th Bowen, conventional—& so on: all this I say has been whizzing & buzzing; & now Boris comes with Maynard’s letter of invitation to the Ott tea: whereupon out drops Ott’s refusal. No, no no, I cant. So thats over. And now to Rodmell this very hot June day."
1933.06.20,"Its a very ugly thing, a ceremony. I detest them more & more. This refers to my waste of a morning at the WCG Jubilee today. Margaret & Lilian, in grey blue, & coffee colour—how characteristic!—presented a banner. M.’s white hair, tied with black bow, wears thin. Their shoulders hunch a little. Otherwise I noted little change. The great hall full. The women all in pinks & blues. Fine old housekeepers; of the Sophie type; massive; determined. Now & then a great laugh; & very queer accents. Mrs Jones of Brighton pronounced twenty different ways. But all was ceremony. Margaret Bondfield: Susan Lawrence—& so on: the bigwigs: & they say things that arent true: they say we are on the brink of a new world; they talk of the triumph of co⁠[-operatio]⁠n. Thats why I hate ceremonies—not a word that fits—all wind blown, gaseous, with elementary emotions. Years ago I got something out of the mere conglomeration, the stir, the multitude. But today, I was not annihilated, dispersed; I said to myself The P.s is more real, truer harder, more veined with blood than all this, & longed to be back, working. How odd to spend a morning merely vacant, regardant!—How many I spend concentrated! Then we shook, & smiled with others intervening Margaret’s, Lilian’s hands: emotions not extreme; & found a back way out. I must now read Wainwrights, a possible East End novel. I am in flood again with The P.s."
1933.06.26,"The present moment. 7 o’clock on June 26th: L. printing: hot: thunderous: I after reading Henry 4 Pt one saying whats the use of writing; reading, imperfectly, a poem by Leopardi; the present moment, in my studio. A bucket banged in the mews; dog barks; woman, ‘I didn’t know if you were out here.’ Leaves door open: far away horns; a bee buzzing. Bobo’s first night; King lays stone of London Un⁠[iversity]. Doctors, scarlet, purple in streets; poor little students in gowns: so to dine, & read Archibald Marshall’s memoir; & music; thunder, I dare say; & so to open my windows, & go up: the moment done."
1933.07.06,"Dinner at Roger’s yesterday. Company, S. Sitwells, Brennan, Oliver. All sat round about in Helen’s bedroom, eating cold things off a table. I next Georgia & Roger. Talk of patent medicines. “And then I found it was an aphrodisiac” G. says. She buys every patent medicine, by way of sedative. Bounds, abounds, halloos dogs on lawn: brown chocolate eyed; vital as they say not intellectual. Made the salad with cheese. Mrs B⁠[renan]. said to be sympathetic & soft & amusing by L. The Quennells: I in my desire not to be crushing perhaps too friendly. Francis Birrell. All chatter. Stayed late. Not much satisfaction—yet amusing enough, as such things are: Helen’s pin points; Roger reading French poetry to Mrs Q. & Gloria [Georgia]. “Gloria” says Helen, on the doorstep “has fallen in love with Dutuit. Caught her sighing at breakfast. My maid is going to have a child. Nonsense Gloria. Well, to tell the truth, I’m headlong in love—so’s he.” Gaily blinking, clumsy, moleish, attractive, always jerking from thing to thing. Knows nothing. Thats what lies behind the aphrodisiac, & the bounce I suppose.

Also to sit with George [Duckworth]—a solid mound in pink pyjamas: Margaret tender & solicitous; given eau de Cologne; also Roger’s show: also—now to the London Library meeting. Two days of misery writing Goldsmith, forced respite from Pargiters."
1933.07.07,"Being headachy after Pargiters & Goldsmith & ever so many people I have spent the whole morning reading old diaries, & am now (10 to 1) much refreshed. This is by way of justifying these many written books. And we have a party tonight—Wests, Hutchinsons, Plomer—so I need rest my head. The diary amuses me."
1933.07.10,"Bella [LW’s sister] arrived & knocked her head upon the window of the car. She cut her nose & was dazed. And then I was in ‘one of my states’—how violent how acute & walked in Regent’s Park in black misery & had to summon my cohorts in the old way to see me through, which they have done more or less. A note made to testify to my own ups & downs; many of which go unrecorded though they are less violent I think than they used to be. But how familiar it was—stamping along the road, with gloom & pain constricting my heart; & the desire for death in the old way all for two, I daresay careless words.

It seems possible that Tom has finally deserted Vivienne. Jack Hutch, came to our frosty sticky party, with the meticulous fish blooded cultivated Andrews—Rebecca merely a hard painted woman, that night, living in society—& Hutch, told us how V. has heard by cable that Tom sailed on 26th & he has not arrived. She has by today worked herself into frenzy—in bed, with a nurse; & then Jack telephoned to Faber—L.’s idea—& they say mysteriously that they cannot discuss the matter on the telephone, but if V. will pull herself together she will realise that there is no reason for anxiety. This we interpret to mean that Tom is back; has told Faber that he is parting from her; but it is kept secret, until he gives leave—which he may do today. Anyhow, V. is clearly concealing something. J⁠[ack]. read one of Tom’s last letters, & describes it as a very cold & brutal document, saying that he has made no money. I should expect that after his 6 months thought & absence he has decided to make the break here: has warned V. & provided for her. But she shuts the letters in the cupboard with the sealed string. L. is made her executor. So I go up to lunch to hear."
1933.07.20,"This was quite a correct statement of the Eliot position. He has left her “irrevocably”; & she sits meanwhile in a flat decorated with pictures of him, & altars, & flowers. Sometimes she prevails on a stranger—like E. Bowen to believe her story, at others lapses into sense. We dine with the Hutchinsons tonight, & shall I expect found some sort of Vivienne fund. It is said that there is a Convent next door to M⁠[ary]. in which she might pass her days, praying for Tom.

I am again in full flood with The P.s after a week of very scanty pages. The trouble is to get the meat pressed in: I mean to keep the rhythm & convey the meaning. It tends more & more, I think—at any rate the E⁠[lvira].M⁠[aggie]. scenes—to drama. I think the next lap ought to be objective, realistic, in the manner of Jane Austen: carrying the story on all the time.

Vita dined [on 18 July]; Nigel has appendicitis; Vita that night had slightly painted her lips, but unskilfully. Now why?"
1933.07.21,"Dinner at the Hutchinsons last night; in the garden, though there might have been a shower. Very cloudy, sultry & completely still. The white cat came out & played about. Mary in white, like a mummy; with a yellow turban, hanging down: chalk white face, like a pierrot. I said I would put her in The Pargiters. She might come in the last scene, or going half jockey too to a party. Like a little horse. We were much more natural & easy than usual. Lobster & cutlets in aspic. We talked of the Eliots a little; then of B⁠[arbara]. & Victor: how both Desmond & I said he was jealous. Then the lights began to flicker on the faces of the houses & on the trees. Mary became rather restless & said would we like to go to the Zoo. We might meet people there, she said. She wanted to go. Jack not much, nor I not much. But we went. And we met Simon [Bussy] & two frenchmen, Masson the ballet maker, in the reptile house. Mary twined the heavy scaly pythons round her: they have bright electric blue bloom on them. They feel like muscles moving under a shiny plated skin; L. took one & it wound itself round his head like a toque, sticking its head out & flicking its tongue at the side. So to the white bears, the polar bears sea lions; & looked at the brilliant green showering trees, with sleepy birds pecking about on the grass.

Vivi. E⁠[liot]. said of the scene with Tom at the solicitors: he sat near me & I held his hand, but he never looked at me.

He’s not a poet, no; so what is he to do “… That is poetry written here by mistake— damn. Maggie in its pre-natal stage; before it has taken wings to itself & flown to the—” She paused at the bookcase, & took down, the Antigone, translated by Edward Pargiter. to the utmost

1933.07.26,"Miss Cashin & L. doing books—‘89 here & 500 sheets’ & I very sleepy after dining with Julia [Tomlin]; having tea with E. Bowen in the heat—the great heat. Another unbroken wave. When I cant write of a morning—as now—I try to tune myself on other books: couldnt settle on any save T. Hardy’s life just now. Rather to my liking. He was unreasonable about critics, so that pale cold chicken Morgan says. And he felt bitter about the treatment of working men at Oxford; hence Jude. “The Marionnette” L. is reading out to Miss Cashin. Quentin has mild pleurisy; Nessa gone down to Charleston; finds Raymond there; at Julia’s last night Wogan [Philipps], “I think you might remainder 50 of M⁠[arionette]. L.”—Dorothy Bussy, Peter Quennell: whom I dont warm to—exiguous worm, rather: skinned: clever; cleverer than Wogan, who’s nicer than Peter. Talk of Memoir Club. “But my autobiography would be too dirty” said PQ. They said—the young—that they had no group. Talk about Ann & Judith: Q. said he deprecated Amazons. I said I liked them till 20 or so. Q. I think is in trouble, so I guess, with his doll of a * A good shot He left her, or she him soon afterwards wife.* “Marriage—”—spoken very bitterly. Told me of a visit to Plaistow to correct proofs with Desmond. Coming back in the rattling tram, D. said to him how someone (he thought Molly) had proposed to him, being a good deal more in love than he was “& they always feel the claws in their heart to this day.” Odd instance of D.’s spasmodic intimacy.

Oh if I could finish my Goldsmith & send it off. I must.

A great many visits: Miss Porter, James Stephen, half witted oaf, on business about Wilberforce, designed to push him on. Got out of meeting Low, at Kingsley Martins, of Mrs Maloney, American editor of the Feis’s. So we go off to Monks House tomorrow, & shall write: yes: The P.’s must be dealt with in masterly manner. An exciting book to write."
1933.07.30,"Rodmell

Settled in again here. A question how far places influence one’s mood. Certain thoughts I always think: the downs spoilt, could we move, &c. leading to a well known round. Quentin ill with pleurisy; may have to have an operation—This the first illness at Charleston. We dine there tonight. And, in order to refresh my mind for P.s I’ve been writing memoirs, & cant disinfect my mind of Fitzroy Sqre. so strong is the past—so as to read Italian. I’m telling the story of W.H. & H.Y. But I am organising life here, & so far rather well. Reading & walking & swimming into lucid depths, powerfully—thats how I put it. And people impend, but can be shelved for the moment—Colefax, E⁠[lizabe]⁠th Read, Julia, the Wolves &c ..

Mrs B.’s case is interesting. It reflects credit on humanity. Her half cousin Lydia Hastie, a mad wandering witted old woman died in Florence & left 17,000: half to Mrs B. This represents safety indeed luxury for life. Now we come down & are given all the lawyers letters. Signora Colli who looked after the dying demented Hastie—Hastie’s letters to Mr Duncan in Aberdeen on politics very interesting; & her perpetual shifting of Josephus, Macaulay & so on—this Colli writes that she had expected 600 a year. And so would certainly have got it, had Miss H. signed a codicil. P⁠[ercy]. & Mrs B. say they will offer her £50 p.a. if the other legatee will do the same. She is not grasping, Miss Colli, accounts for every penny, & Dr Potts is humane: & the B.’s full of sense & restraint—more than I, had I suddenly one thousand without working. These little tributes to human nature are deserved after Hitler & Mussolini—about whom Miss Hastie often wrote. I figure her perpetually arranging her blue & gold tea set, her fathers watch, the bon bon box, & the card box made of the Fern oak in Windsor “which was mentioned in Shakespeare” in the house in Florence, where she lived with Colli aged 76."
1933.08.08,"Since we came here I have been twice to Charleston; seen the Keyneses; been to Worthing; had Eth Read (a nice shrewd hard girl with a public mind) to tea; the Easdales & Norman Stewart (a clever, good fellow, scientist) to tea; expect Mrs Nef at 3 to discuss her scandalous memoirs: we go to London on Friday & Ethel comes on Sunday. Is this peace? I’m heavy brained today—its been so hot; & I have read Mrs Nef from 10 to 12.20. Scandals about USA: but I am sworn to secrecy. I imagine a pretty youngish jumpy intellectual-fashionable American, completely disoriented; writes rather well; interesting; but all at sea."
1933.08.12,"So naturally after Mrs Nef I was so tired—I shivered & shook. I went to bed for 2 days & slept I daresay 7 hours, visiting the silent realms again. It strikes me—what are these sudden fits of complete exhaustion? I come in here to write: cant even finish a sentence; & am pulled under; now is this some odd effort; the sub-conscious pulling me down into her? I’ve been reading Faber on Newman; compared his account of a nervous breakdown; the refusal of some part of the mechanism; is that what happens to me? Not quite. Because I’m not evading anything. I long to write The Pargiters. No. I think the effort to live in 2 spheres: the novel; & life is a strain; Nefs’s almost break me, because they strain me so far from the other world; I only want walking & perfectly spontaneous childish life with L. & the accustomed when I’m writing at full tilt: to have to behave with circumspection & decision to strangers wrenches me into another region; hence the collapse.

Still, Saturday, I cant focus; am disoriented; sleepy; physically tired, but quite calm; the dear old repetitions soothe me again: L.; Pinka; dinner; tea; papers; music; I have a dread of ‘seeing’ people: increase this in anticipation: but what I dread is the wrench to another sphere."
1933.08.16,"And owing to Sir Alan Cobham’s flying, & Angelica & Julian & fetching the boat I had another headache, & bed, & didnt see Ethel, but heard her voice & have 6 pages on the subject this morning, & didnt see the Wolves, & am out here again, nibbling at The P.s & thinking Oh Lord how am I ever going to pull all that into shape! What a tremendous struggle it’ll be! Never mind. I want to discuss Form, having been reading Turgenev, (but how my hand trembles after one of these headaches—cant lay hands on words or pens exactly—the habit has been broken)

Form then, is the sense that one thing follows another rightly. This is partly logic. T. wrote & re-wrote. To clear the truth of the unessential. Dostoevsky But then D. would say that everything matters. But one cant read D. again. Now Sh⁠[akespea]⁠re. was constrained in form by the stage (T. says one must find a new form for the old subject: but here, I suppose, uses the word differently—) The essential thing in a scene is to be preserved. How do you know what this is? How do we know if the D. form is better or worse than the T. It seems less permanent. T.’s idea that you the writer states the essential & lets the reader do the rest. D. to supply the reader with every possible help & suggestion. T. reduces the possibilities.

The difficulty about criticism is that it is so superficial The writer has gone so much deeper. T. kept a diary for Bazarov: wrote everything from his point of view. We have only 250 short pages. Our criticism is only a birds eye view of the pinnacle of an iceberg. The rest under water. One might begin it in this way. The article might be more broken, less composed than usual."
1933.08.24,"A week ago, on Friday to be precise, having got my wind again, I dipped into The Pargiters, & determined to sweat it bare of flesh before going on, accumulating more scenes. I am rearranging too, all the first part, so as to bring it together. The death happens in the first chapter now. I think I shall reduce the size by half; it is however a little bare & jerky at present. Moreover it is rather a rush & a strain. I have just killed Mrs P. & cant shoot ahead to Oxford. For the truth is these little scenes embroil one, just as in life; & one cant switch off to a different mood all in a second. It seems to me that the realness of the beginning is complete. I have a good excuse for poetry in the second part, if I can take it. Rather an interesting experiment—if I could see the same thing from two different views.

And now I have spent the morning reading the Confessions of Arsene Houssaye left here yesterday by Clive. What a vast fertility of pleasure books hold for me! I went in & found the table laden with books. I looked in & sniffed them all. I could not resist carrying this one off & broaching it. I think I could happily live here & read forever.

It is true, we have many interruptions. Yesterday, after knocking against a wild Alsatian that ran into the car—we gave him a great bang—he lay squirming—dead, I thought, then reeled up & went galloping over the field, unhurt, though he broke our lamps & bent the mud guard—after this unpleasant shock, Clive came & Julian & Frances Marshall. Clive said only one thing to hurt me—how I could not take a beating at a game. That was a feeble effort, compared with what he can do in that line. Otherwise we were affable enough; & played bowls; & Fanny asked us to Ham Spray, where we may go, if we make our Western tour. Still, we see too many people, to my view: the Kingsley Martins, who are to me mentally & physically unattractive people; the sort of people George Trevelyan would have liked 25 years ago: this struck me, for their views are ‘right’, & she is ugly stringy earnest plain. K. eats so sloppily. And they force themselves upon us. Into the bargain, I have heard from Tom, & from Peter [Lucas]. Tom is all artifice & quips & querks. A defence. One of these days perhaps he’ll give up the trick, with marriage, or perhaps religion. All the same, our quiet days, in between times, are rightly balanced, full of peace, & possibilities. How happy, when people go, to get our dinner, & sit alone, & go to bed in my airy room, where the rising sun on the apples & asparagus wakes me, if I leave the curtain open. I am reading all Turgenev, with a view to an article; for I intend to space the arduous sections of The P.s with serene criticism. This keeps me in reading while I spin fiction. A happy day today, without visitors. Hugh Jones & the Cartwrights, alas, tomorrow."
1933.08.27,"The Cartwrights werent so bad after all, though a bit of a grind—two gawky girls, & Hugh, a schoolboy, with a crest worked on his coat pocket. The girls squawked a little; too genteel over their tea, which they devoured. I had had the forethought to buy sugar cakes in Lewes, where we had to go in the morning, to take Martin’s [garage] man back; for he had brought the car, refurbished from the Alsatian. And my typewriter ribbon had gone wrong. So we went in & found Lewes in festival—the corporation fidgetting about on a doorstep covered with dull red: the local tradesmen habited in blue robes with thin strips of fur, because the troops were coming, on their economy march to Arundel. We ran into them; dirty men in shirtsleeves, marching, with the flaps of their caps let down over their necks, it was so hot. The natives of Lewes stood at the bottom of Station Street waving handkerchiefs, bobbing their umbrellas up & down. Not an inspiring sight—the British army; & I disliked the credulous fat faced old women who had been dabbing their handkerchiefs in the air. But the Cartwrights had their cakes, & we played bowls. They are all 3 becoming scientists, possibly scientific chemists, science, they say being the most popular subject now, though they are doubtful about jobs. Now & again Hugh reminded me of Philip. The same green blue prominent eyes, & I thought that I detected perhaps a finer grain in him than in the others. But L. denies this. They were nice, simple, shy; why did they come, I wondered? Did Mrs C. & Mrs J. insist? We drove them over to the Sea Hotel on the front at Seaford, & I saw seaside life going on. And they seemed very young & unfitted—I mean, the average, not the exception. They bathe, running down the steps of the sea hotel into the sea. A sort of beauty too. Not that I liked the couple in evening dress who passed. She was wearing a fur coat. Why dress for dinner? To show your social standing? Home, & Tarring Neville looked very lovely.

And I forgot to say that Flush has been chosen by the American Book Society. Lord!"
1933.08.30,"And two days ago, sitting in the garden at Charleston, Clive in his queer jerky way said he had very bad news of Francis Birrell & brought out a letter from Raymond. F. has a tumour on his brain & is to be operated on, perhaps, today. So all night I dreamt of him, my dream giving me, as my dreams often do, the essence of a relationship which in real life will never find expression. I remember sitting beside him on a sofa, & how we kissed & kissed, as friends; though in my dream I do not think that I knew he was ill. I am rather haunted by it. Think of waiting all yesterday, for an operation which may well be fatal. What should I have felt had I been him? And why was I not him? The sense of friends dying is a very terrible one.

Yesterday here was hot, baking hot; & Campbell Douglas came, 10.30: Robson 2.30. “Call me Willie” he said at 5: at 6 Vita came; Mr Neil Lyons strolled in from the road to beg bay leaves for his pickled herrings, & a sprig of hazel since he suspects himself of being a water diviner. Vita stayed the night; we had grouse for dinner; she spent the morning talking to me; & Mary Hutchinson has just rung up to suggest a visit. Tomorrow we go to London."
1933.09.02,"With that usual dread of asking for news on the telephone, I rang up Raymond on Thursday & heard to my extreme relief, that F.’s case is not so bad nearly as it seemed. The growth is small, thought to [be] on the outside, & there seems no reason why he should not recover. I seemed to see him hauled up into the air again as R. spoke. The operation is next week. Curious how all ones fibres seem to expand & fill with air when anxiety is taken off; curious also to me the intensity of my own feelings: I think imagination, the picture making power, decks up feelings with all kinds of scenes; so that one goes on thinking, instead of localising the event. All very mysterious. But anyhow I expanded, & felt very fond of that dear old rattling milk lorry, & hoped he would see me out, & must bring myself to write to him. Partly selfishness, of course, this horror, that it means another extinction of one’s own life: brings death nearer. But let us think no more of death. Its life that matters, to quote my quotation from Montaigne.

Suddenly in the night I thought of “Here & Now” as a title for The Pargiters. I think it better. It shows what I’m after & does not compete with the Herries Saga, the Forsyte Saga & so on. I have now done the first part; I mean compressed it, shall, I think, compress Eleanor’s day, & then what? The rest does not admit of much compression! think I have reduced it to 80,000 words perhaps; but it seems to me there must be another 40, to come. 80+40 = 120,00[0]. If so it will be the longest of my little brood—longer than N⁠[ight]. & D⁠[ay]. I imagine

As Percy says when he brings in the slop pail & I’m boiling the kettle “You’ve never had such a summer”. No I say, “its been fine since Christmas” which is more or less the case. We have steadied the old ship & sail through blue days again. L. is having the new pond made, the old one re-grouted, & is going to pave the front garden. Flush, I think with some pleasure, has made these extravagances possible. We should net £2,000 from that six months dogged & dreary grind. What will people say of that little book I wonder, without great anxiety. Tom wrote yesterday, telling me, in his jaunty uneasy manner, to conceal his address, & the date of his visit. The mystery I imagine flatters him. But we shall see deeper into that dark well perhaps. And I have had 2 blessed days of silence. & we walked on the marsh today, & saw a drowned sheep, & were flurried by our 3 dogs. And I have decided by the way not to accept the Leslie Stephen lectureship which has not been offered me, & feel comfortably cool & obscure & anonymous. As Lytton once said, success came to us too late to make us hop on our perches.

I am reading with extreme greed a book by Vera Britain, called The Testament of Youth. Not that I much like her. A stringy metallic mind, with I suppose, the sort of taste I should dislike in real life. But her story, told in detail, without reserve, of the war, & how she lost lover & brother, & dabbled her hands in entrails, & was forever seeing the dead, & eating scraps, & sitting five on one WC, runs rapidly, vividly across my eyes. A very good book of its sort. The new sort, the hard anguished sort, that the young write; that I could never write. Nor has anyone written that kind of book before. Why now? What urgency is there on them to stand bare in public? She feels that these facts must be made known, in order to help—what? herself partly I suppose. And she has the social conscience. I have still to read how she married the infinitely dreary Catlin & found beauty & triumph in poor, gaping Holtby. But I give her credit for having lit up a long passage to me at least. I read & read & read & neglect Turgenev & Miss C. Burnett. But why does my hand shake? Why cant I write clearly?"
1933.09.10,"To begin with another question (just read the last pages) why am I sitting here at 10.30 on a Sunday morning, rather stiff in the back, rather sore of the lips, writing diary, not novel? Because of dear old Tom largely. 24 hours (short interval for sleep) solid conversation, preluded by 2 hours flimsy conversation with the Hutchinsons. And at 1.30 Rosamond & Wogan to lunch; & at 4.30 Charleston to tea. Hence I am sitting here. Tomorrow, in the divine peace of Monday, I shall walk on the downs & think of Tom & my parched lips with some degree of pleasure. Yes, it was worth it, though when a second day seemed on the cards my tongue fainted & my heart stood still. He is 10 years younger: hard, spry, a glorified boy scout in shorts & yellow shirt. He is enjoying himself very much. He is tight & shiny as a wood louse (I am not writing for publication). But there is well water in him, cold & pure. Yes I like talking to Tom. But his wing sweeps curved & scimitar like round to the centre himself. He’s settling in with some severity to being a great man. Keats wasn’t that. We talked about Keats’s letters. Tom said that letter writing was a form he preferred to Times leader writing. I think this hints some change in his views. He said that he no longer thought felt quite so sure of a science of criticism. He also said that people exaggerate the intellectuality & erudition of his poetry. “For example Ross Williamson in his book on me … He says that very seriously. I couldnt quote Holtby with the same candour. Ross apparently attributed the dog, in Tom’s quotation from Webster, to profound associations with the dog star. Not a bit of it says Tom: I was having a joke about Webster. I connect all this with his bubbling up of life. At 46 he wants to live, to love; even seeing Rochester is an event to him. He has seen nothing, nobody, for the last 10 years. We had it out about V. at breakfast. Some asperity on Tom’s part. He wont admit the excuse of insanity for her—thinks she puts it on; tries to take herself in; for this reason, mystifies Eth Bowen. I thought him a little resentful of all the past waste & exaction. I gather he will see a good deal of us: & if I had time, & if I could move the heavy stone of his self esteem an inch or two higher, I should like to talk out to Tom about writing. Only there’s always the reservation—I cant talk about “my writing”; so that talk about his writing palls⁠[?]. But I am to find him 2 rooms in Somers Town. And we agreed about the infamy of teaching English; the idiocy of lectures; the whole hierarchy of professor, system & so on: at any rate I got him to go some way with me in denouncing Oxford & Cambridge. He learnt (1) self confidence at Oxford; (2) how to write plain English—thats all. I daresay though he will become Prof. of Poetry at Oxford one of these days.

His father was a brick merchant in St Louis; & they lived in the slums among vacant lots. & his father always gave away money; & died, alas, in 1919 before Tom had become—well, happily his mother lived to see him what she called (& I daresay Tom too) a great man. What a queer naïve vanity all this is! But of course, when you are thrown like an assegai into the hide of the world—this may be a definition of genius—there you stick; & Tom sticks. To shut out, to concentrate—that is perhaps—perhaps—one of the necessary conditions. And now it is close on eleven; the bells are tolling; the leaves are very bright on pear tree & apple tree; & I think I shall dawdle over letters & books—I must read 12th night for Lydia’s extortion (an article on her appearance) & so drowse as quietly as possible till we have to talk incessantly till 8 o’clock—& then O Lord—quiet, dine alone, & sleep in my airy room; & no talk tomorrow or tomorrow.

(why not write a book—of Cr⁠[itics]⁠m in this style?)"
1933.09.23,"This summer, I may say by way of criticism, & as a warning, has been too broken up with people. Next year I intend to be more circumspect. For the past fortnight I have lived, I say, as other people live—that is outwardly. I gave up The P.s, had reached the end of the revision; & as we had the Lucas’s, Angelica & [her friend] Eve [Younger], to stay, also to go to London, to dine with the Hutches, to have Morgan for the week end, & the memoir Club tonight, it seemed wise to attempt no concentration; but to participate with one’s friends. I’ve had to wedge in though, that horrid tough little article on 12th night; which being tentatively roughed out this morning I write here.

And it is a thorough wet day. The ponds are filling. L.’s new pond & garden are almost done, & surprisingly good, I think. The summer is put away folded up in the drawer with other summers. By Gods grace we may get 10 or 12 days without visitors before going back, but I say this not with conviction. The truth is, I like it when people actually come; but I love it when they go. It was this subconsciously that made me assume that Peter & Prudence were only staying the night—whereas he had suggested two nights. This was the cause of some embarrassment. We had to go to London soon after breakfast. She is one of the direct shorthaired terrier kind, breaking, unexpectedly, into loud barks. Why Peter, the fastidious, should commit himself for life to her, after Topsy, I cant think. A hand raised in the High or the Low would summon 20 such instantly. For life!—good God! I could not envisage a week of that ardent, shadeless, untidy, loveless, beautyless little woman; at 22 perhaps: but think of 32, 42, 52—No. He is single eyed though; paces through life between blinkers, seeing only the high road. Perhaps Prudence serves as giglamp. She works for him in libraries. They quote Greek & Latin. And he never reads a book unless he is going to write about it, she says. And so he will pen his way through life—charming, honest, fastidious, ascetic as he is; & will leave a long trail of books behind him—which I shall never read, because he writes with frozen fingers.

Old Ethel came, grown stout. And as I say, we go to Brighton today to meet Morgan, & I shall read my memoir tonight, send off my article on Monday morning, & so consider myself quit of all duties to my friends. Monday begins my holiday, my breathing space. I shall go for a long walk, I tell myself, & read Smoke [Turgenev] in the evening, having played a game of bowls with L. And it will be a very fine day. And I shall pull open my curtains & see the stars at night. Really a marvellous spectacle—all for nothing. I am reading Margot—“V W our greatest English authoress;” Molly Hamilton on Webbs: & Turgenev."
1933.09.26,"Why not, one of these days, write a fantasy on the theme of Crabbe?—a biographical fantasy—an experiment in biography?

I had so much of the most profound interest to write here—a dialogue of the soul with the soul,—& I have let it all slip—why? Because of feeding the gold fish, of looking at the new pond, of playing bowls. Nothing remains now. I forget what It was about. Happiness. The perfect day, which was yesterday. And so on. Now I began the morning by telephoning corrections of 12th Night to the N.S., put in a comma, take out semi-colon; & so on. Then I come out here, having seen the carp, & write Turgenev."
1933.10.02,"Yes. I had to write about the memoir Club, & Molly’s biting our hands. “Its torture anyhow, when one cant hear a word”. Then they all came over, & we sat on the terrace; eleven people here; Julian in outline with E. Read. “Julian’s going to teach me to think” she said as she went. I had to scurry back to MacCarthys. Thats all over.

Its October now; & we have to go to Hastings Conference tomorrow & Wednesday, to Vita, then back to London. I opened this in order to make one of my self-admonishments previous to publishing a book. Flush will be out on Thursday & I shall be very much depressed, I think, by the kind of praise. They’ll say its ‘charming’ delicate, ladylike. And it will be popular. Well now I must let this slip over me without paying it any attention. I must concentrate on The Pargiters—or Here & Now. I must not let myself believe that I’m simply a ladylike prattler: for one thing its not true. But they’ll all say so. And I shall very much dislike the popular success of Flush. No, I must say to myself, this is a mere wisp, a rill of water; & so create, hardly [?] fiercely, as I feel now more able to do than ever before."
1933.10.05,"No, I will not tackle the peculiarity of Turgenev. For one thing we are starting at 11.30 sharp for Sissinghurst; & then I spent yesterday in bed; headache; infinite weariness up my back: clouds forming in my neck; half asleep; through the rift reading Steen (author of Stallion) on Hugh Walpole. My word—how Hugh can let that rotten pear lie on his name God knows. “God is Romance. God is The Character in Hugh Wal’s novels” & so on. And then Flush has taken his first fence, the Lit Sup, at a bound. Also to my pleasure, some obscure journalist detects no signs of whimsicality. So, though I shall get some nasty raps in the weeklies, I am sunning my wings this morning: this bright soft October morning: when the pear tree has a spatter of bright leaves; Caburn is under mist; the big pond is almost full; the little pond done; & thank Heaven, L. & I are driving off, ever so happily, through Kent. This is going to be a happy day, I say;

On Tuesday we went to Hastings; a queer experience always, that conference: a door opened into a buzzing bursting humming perfectly self dependent other world. Bevan [Bevin] was vociferating when we came in. But they were all marking time owing to a compromise. There are details I never get clear. When one of the tub thumpers was up, we went & sat on the balcony. The Hall is a very gay frivolous seaside hall, & the ships passed very indifferently on the horizon adapted for municipal concerts dances & so on. We sat out & had coffee on a green table, & Gillies came, & Phil Baker, & they dissected policies, again invisible to me, though Gillies threw out the remark (in deference to me, perhaps?) that he was not naturally a politician, but preferred Gardens; had been staying at Zennor: W. A. F. has a whole field of gentians &c. Phil does not truckle to the arts, for which I like him. I always think about his teeth being filed. And then the Rodent—a mixture of Bob [Trevelyan] & Youngs—reminiscent of my early youth—a rather thin, water blooded kind of man, with hair parted & steel grey eyes—& a mouth like a spinsters reticule, but of course humane, vitalised by his humanity, sufferings of negroes, son who goes to Russia, vegetarian, once every 3 weeks overcome with lust for beef—ate fish—he gave us lunch at Frascati’s, or some such place. I had a vast plate of beef. L. fed Pinka on the bone of his cutlet. R. in his way genial, a man of the world; a gentleman I thought as I followed him through his hotel by a secret passage out. He held himself so well. Then to the Queens Hotel where the bigwigs lodge: & then Rodent being a gentleman wished to entertain us & crooked his finger & summoned Pethick Lawrence & Mr Robertson & the lady who calls herself Mrs being in fact a Fitzroy & the friend of Mrs Walter. I talked to Pethick L.; a frost-bitten blue eyed little old man now; & he was reading Holtby on V.W. You are V.W.? Yes. I said; & then in my emotional way praised his speech that wet day at Brighton: which kindled him a little; & he told me about his wife, now speaking at Oxford about armament firms. I was enlightened & horrified; how France & Germany combine to stir up war—were joint manufacturers of guns & so on. All this should be a government industry he said. I said What an argument against Capitalism! And then he had to go to the Con⁠[feren]⁠ce to hear Dalton: but we could only stand very little of Hugh; & so went out, got into the car & drove home.

The night before we went to a meeting here, in the Club, & L. broached the question of a play ground. Captain Palmer talked to me—a man with one idea in his perfectly direct upright wizened tanned little being. His wife more voluptuous had been at Wye races therefore was sleepy. He had a great idea of duty to the village: called the men Back, Hubbard & so on, & thought it a disgrace that Toc H in Lewes should be asked to supply a helper to run a boys club. He was also inclined to think Mr Hancock a menace. But I must get ready now for Vita."
1933.10.06,"Less jubilant, on account of Rebecca West’s criticism: that F⁠[lush] is not one of my best &c: but rather braced. The problem will now be how to guide oneself through popularity: a curious reversal of my old problem; but I daresay the same. An interesting problem: I like problems to change. Now for Turgenev, in my braced mood. It is better to write braced than relaxed—"
1933.10.07,"no doubt true; but this morning (Saturday) cheered by Bunny’s praise. Says its a new venture; the best in proportion & so on. And today not a word about me anywhere. So thats soothing. And if tomorrow were over, Sunday Times & Observer through, I could settle in snugly. Oh & Morgan says my memoir was ‘wonderful’; which pleases me for the light it throws on Here & Now. Perhaps I can bring off that style. And now, letters, packing, going from the lodge to the house; a damp dull day so far, but it will clear. However there’s the cement works here; so I must balance one thing with another. A very crowded gay summer in its way. Too crowded; but what happiness, coming back that night from London with L. for example: the country at midnight. And going [?] up early; & bowls, & our solitary evenings; & cooking dinner."
1933.10.09,"52 Tavistock Square

Back again & our burden is on us. Mrs Woolf yesterday; today David Cecil; tomorrow Nessa Quentin Julian lunch; Hugh Walpole tea; Thursday Vita & Mrs St. Aubyn—& so it begins, with Sibyl & Rosamund in the background. I’m through the Flush wave though. A small one, compared with others. Desmond praises: Morn P. tears me between the rough, coarse yellow feeble teeth of poor Mr Grigson. So its over: & if it werent for the strain of people, dentists, clothes—but no: I’m going to master this. I’m going to let my self have room & verge enough. Talk of leaving London yesterday & moving the Press to Monks House: talk of buying a cottage in the North. We have plenty of money anyhow.

A soft day; have to take the car to Hendon, am writhing with Turgenev of a morning. Can I finish this week, & start Here & now next? Can I?"
1933.10.16,"And then Desmond broke in; yes—but today is Monday again, the 16th; & I have lived through the scrimmage of that week, & actually at 2.30 today, delivered my Turgenev to the typist, & so have tomorrow free for Here & Now. Free—yes. After Philip W⁠[oolf]. & Babs to supper yesterday. I pared the cold mutton & put it in the pot. Mary comes today: L. is sneezing; pray God not a cold; Miss Evans [unidentified] is pending; & I want, rather vainly, to read the Book of Job. Tomorrow & tomorrow & tomorrow. Yesterday we said Time stand still & walked up a hill outside Princes Risborough. I seem to have stopped inventing The P.s about Aug 20th then rewrote:"
1933.10.20,"Did I say I was going to write Here & Now? Not a word done. L. had influenza; so Elly says. Up & about in 2 days of course. But last night I came to the decision to stop the career of the Hogarth Press; to revert to Richmond days. What is the use of drudging & sweating & curtailing Siena & entirely obliterating all Italy England Ireland & Greece for the sake of publishing Susan Lawrence & bad novels? No. Here we stop & take a fresh course—We go to Rodmell tomorrow & I shall there broach the new scheme. Look, I cant write, cant hold a pen, all for the bother & the worry. I can only hear the pump booming. Its true I wrote the Turgenev, all yesterday till my head spun. Its true we’ve had the devils own week. But to me the Press has lost its spring & balance, & could regain it if it now made a constriction to the old ideals. We might start the magazine.

It’s possible that Flush is to be pictured. Brace yesterday talked of a substantial sum. It will fall through I suppose; but for Gods sake, why make more money? I have a thousand letters to write & Hampson to read—cant spin a sentence in the air, or even control my nib. So no more.

Oh & Gerald Brenan’s book is unmitigated trash—a sickly slab of plum cake iced with pink fly blown sugar, in spite of Bunny."
1933.10.29,"No my head is too tired to go on with Bobby & Elvira—theyre to meet at St Paul’s—this morning. I wish I could get it full & calm & unconscious. This last is difficult, owing to Flush, owing to the perpetual little spatter of comment that keeps me awake. Yesterday the Granta said I was now defunct. Orlando Waves Flush represent the death of a potentially great writer. This is only a rain drop; I mean the snub some little pimpled undergraduate likes to administer, just as he would put a frog in ones bed: but then there’s all the letters, & the requests for pictures—so many that, foolishly perhaps, I wrote a sarcastic letter to the N.S.—thus procuring more rain drops. This metaphor shows how tremendously important unconsciousness is when A man wrote to say that my letter is to be the basis of a new guild for the P. of P. See January number of something or other one writes. But let me remember that fashion in literature is an inevitable thing; also that one must grow & change; also that I have, at last laid hands upon my philosophy of anonymity. My letter to the N.S. is the crude public statement of a part of it. How odd last winter’s revelation was! freedom; which now I find makes it quite easy for me to refuse Sibyl’s invitations, to take life much more strongly & steadily. I willnot be ‘famous’ ‘great’. I will go on adventuring, changing, opening my mind & my eyes, refusing to be stamped & stereotyped. The thing is to free ones self; to let it find its dimensions, not be impeded. And though this as usual is only a pot shot, there is a great deal of substance in it. October has been a bad month; but might have been much worse without my philosophy. Its been harassed, then L. with influenza, if only for 2 days, quickens all my insight into disaster; then Nessa away; Quentin ill; with it all, however, I have forced myself to space out these horrors.

But enough. Raymond came yesterday: Francis still very much paralysed; after 10 minutes the Raymond machine clogs; an uneasy shallow sandy mind; Eth Bowen, improving; oh & the Kingsley Martins never cease to invite us to meet Low.

Shall I now read the New Testament?

The great family dinner is tonight.

I think the pump is improved, by a letter to Bentley."
1933.11.12,"I ought to have made a note on Nessa & the aeroplane—last Friday—no Friday week—at Croydon. We took them there at 7. Had to be up by moonlight at 6.30. Drove across an empty delicately tinted London; lines all much marked; Croydon a great space like a green race course. We stood on the top of the roof; saw the aeroplane whirl, till the propellors were lost to sight—simply evaporated: then the aeroplane takes a slow run, circles & rises. This is death I said, feeling how the human contact was completely severed. Up they went with a sublime air & disappeared like a person dying, the soul going. And we remained. I saw the plane become a little mark on the sky. A good funeral could be arranged. And I did not at all enjoy waiting for Nessa to come back across the Alps: sat making conversation with Lady Simon. So thats over.

And our visit to Francis—the shaven Chinese Idol; old Birrell grown very soft & babyish, in slippers, with his shod stick beside him, apologising in an airy way for the basin & hairbrushes—all very airy now, for he cant remember names—Vanessa or Virginia? & so on. Now, this minute back from the Wogans; a lovely fox red glow from beech trees; old Oxford farm houses; theirs a large, too wide, too square & cold, old house; disguised, to me unpleasantly, by Banting’s decorations—I prefer the old to the new there, unless done with more taste. But how nice, easy, mobile, affectionate, & humane it all was. We talked of Lytton & Carrington last night, Wogan sent for, 30 miles, twice one day to master Ralph, who emerged from the bushes, where he was skulking, threatening suicide. And had barricaded his door against Frances. Wogan has a shrewd worldly sense for all his patter. Said Ralph play-acted; was a lonely, but boring man; brings you tea stark naked, a bull among heifers. Theyre all naked, they all comment eternally on ‘parts’ & breasts—a kind of rough parody of the old Ham Spray—Lytton acted in the kitchen. We walked this morning, but soft mist hid the hills; all was red brick Queen Anne, stately, arboreous—the moment of loveliness that comes to everything over it today. Harrod to lunch—a young⁠[?] man with black eyebrows & white teeth. So home to tea."
1933.11.14,"And I have precisely 3 minutes before tea to say that Jacqueline Stiven has taken up a great deal of time & inspired a great deal of ingenuity by sending a passage from A R of Ones O to the Statesman. L. was positive it was a hoax. But I have now been in touch with Mrs Miles Reid & Mrs Stiven the Syrian—names that will mean nothing to me in a years time. We went to Islington this afternoon to look for rooms for Tom; it is a fine autumn day; Vita & Leon dined last night, & I am so dissipated I could not write a word this morning. Then Bunny came about the hoax. So to tea, & I should add so to Westminster to hear The March of the Women, Ethel Smyth; & Rebecca speaking on married womens earnings. Instead I shall sleep over the fire, reading Tom’s criticism, & Michael Field diaries, alone thank God."
1933.11.23,"Being too tired after dining with the Hutches last night to meet Michael Arlen to produce the finished article in Here & Now, perhaps I had better produce the raw. It was a real party—that is I wore my velvet dress.

But I took it in my stride. I was not much beglamoured. The drug only half worked. E⁠[lizabe]⁠th Bibesco came in, a ruffle of pink feathers round her shoulders, as we were ranged on the stairs coming down. Pasty, podgy, her point the eyes, which to me seemed sadder, as if she had flung away the orange. & she talked of her daughter. And I had—oh voluminously—all M.A.’s confession, as I expected. He made £50,000 out of the Green hat, which money he has perpetually to atone for—as by talking of D.H.L., & how he escaped his influence, how he made his own life how he married his own wife, a dumb Greek called Atalanta,—silent, he said, but a perfect lady—& has 2 children & can keep them all, with drains games servants—all this is protest & justification. Now he is writing an intelligent novel, from real experience, lacking to highbrows. Yet oh Mrs Woolf how I envy Aldous Huxley his background—his education. I was at a 3rd rate public school, & lived in Earls Court. His father died of a broken heart when Roumania came into the war. A little scraping dingy porous clammy monkey faced man. My wife the Contessa Atalanta … always still justifying, but I didnt feel that need myself. Sat with Victor [Rothschild] & B⁠[arbara]. in Mary’s bedroom & V. got above himself—as he will do more & more—too butcher like in his red flesh, too thick cut, underdone, assertive. “We do all this sort of thing in public”—fondling B.’s arm. We dont think of age, Virginia. Called me Virginia too often. “The most malicious person I’ve ever met”. That stung a little, but not eno’ to get a real rise. Talked of Dadie & Mrs Barnes. Gave a sporadic account of Dadie’s fathers death & so on. Was too self assured with the P⁠[rince]⁠ss.—the handsome irresistible young man. I shall tell him some home truths. B. called out of the room. Absent 20 minutes. Thats V. on the telephone. “How dare you call me conceited! We cant dine out together in future thats all … I will call you conceited—I’ll write to Virginia … You were conceited…” & so on: always bickering. He brought her a bandbox full of the Rothschild rubies, worth £300,000 so that they cant be insured—a crown that glows & drips red light. He said there was a book in the box. No, I dont altogether like that. So home at last, leaving Eth at 44."
1933.11.25,"L.’s birthday. Off to see the Sickerts with a view to writing; see his letter. Dear me. This comes however after a lull: I mean theyre sitting in Kensington Gds & I want a breath before I go on to Kitty’s Party. (I at once make her say I oughtn’t to have been doing this kind of thing & then I see Lord Lasswade. But stop.) [Cf. The Years] I was going to say old Birrell died last Monday; & is cremated—odd, to have had that last talk, in the Hotel at Brighton—odd to have seen the sharp old man at the very edge of taking off, sitting plump pink soft yet with his rather formidable acuteness, with his shod stick & his slippers. “These legs, that have taken me to so many good places wont work any more” he said, apologising for not being able to get up. “I made it a rule never to refuse what was offered”. A story about C⁠[ampbell].B⁠[annerman]. And Frankie’s brain. “They took out what was all nonsense—the Eton part—all nonsense”. But at one moment the Birrell family was on the verge of extinction—So I got And saying “Did you know the Souls—Oh Margot—a very generous woman, believe she’s coming tomorrow”. The door opened, & I was beckoned off from old Birrell to Francis."
1933.11.29,"So feebly minded after too much talk—sat to Nessa, Tom to tea, Fry’s [to] dinner. I cant make way even through the shallow waters of Sickert.

I am making a sketch of him at random. And so I thought I would make a footnote about the soul. I think I’ve got rid of vanity: of Virginia. Oh what a riddance. I’ve not read an article on me by a man called Peel in the Criterion. I feel this a great liberation. Then I need not be that self. Then I can be entirely private. I have cut the string that ties me to that quivering bag of nerves—all its gratifications & acute despair. Time I did. It is another great discovery. One sees people lunging & striking at a thing like a straw horse & its not me at all. I sit back in comfort & look round. I wonder if Nessa has always been like this? It is calming. It is dignified. One does not seek uneasily for opinions on oneself. How have I come to this? Will it last? How will it work? I lie awake at night astonishingly happy sometimes. What a poem, for 10 minutes. The advantage is that it gives me a great deal to spend on L.; on reading; on doing what one likes. I wonder whether this is related to any of the famous human feelings. A rough note only which I meant to make some time ago."
1933.12.04,"Staying with the Fishers. A queer thing, people who accept conventions. Gives them a certain force. H⁠[erbert]. has the organisation behind him. But robs them of character, of vagaries, of depth, warmth, the unexpected. They spin along the grooves. H. to some extent anxious to impress his privileged impartial position. Many stories of “when I was in the Cabinet”. Yet why not? The odd thing is that when with them one accepts their standards. And whats wrong? So nice, just, equable, humane. But how chill! And over his shoulder I see the rulers; small; but not evil; striving,—a complex impression. Warden⁠[s] have lived there since 1370—or so. How can he differ? Young men all very smooth, but talkative. Nothing to strike on. A nice nameless boy told me he read Greek 8 hours daily. Some like Oxford, some think it a place of restrictions. Scatters Wilson’s son said this. Yes, Herbert accepts the current values, only rather intellectualises & refines. Dismissed Tom, Clive, Maynard (partly) in favour of the great forces of vitality—Winston, L. George. Lettice waspish about Labour Party. L.G. their trump card—their pattern man. No music in Tom. Ottoline dirty. Tells stories of Balfour & in the manner of the great man—discreet, nipped, bloodless, like a butler used to the best families. Toils at history of Europe. Is an example. Do their duty by the college. Represent culture, politics, worldly wisdom gilt with letters. Nothing to whizz one off one’s perch at New College: all in good taste, & very kind. But Lord to live like that!"
1933.12.07,"I was walking through Leicester Sqre—how far from China—just now when I read Death of noted Novelist on the poster. And I thought of Hugh Walpole. But it is Stella Benson. Then why write anything, immediately? I did not know her, but have a sense of those fine patient eyes: the weak voice; the cough; the sense of oppression. She sat on the terrace with me at Rodmell. And now, so quickly, it is gone, what might have been a friendship. Trusty & patient & very sincere—I think of her; trying to cut through, in one of those difficult evenings, to some deeper layer—certainly we could have reached it, given the chance. I’m glad I stopped her at the door as she got into her little car & asked her to call me Virginia—to write to me. And she said There’s nothing I should like better. But its like the quenching of something—her death out there in China; & I sitting here, & writing about her, & so fugitive, & yet so true; & no more to come. How mournful the afternoon seems, with the newspaper carts dashing up Kingsway “Death of Noted Novelist” on the placard. A very fine steady mind: much suffering; suppressed;—there seems to be some sort of reproach to me in her death, as in K⁠[atherine] M⁠[ansfield’]⁠s. I go on; & they cease. Why? Why not my name on the posters? And I have a feeling of the protest each might make: gone with their work unfinished—each so suddenly. Stella was 41. “I am going to send you my book ><” & so on. A dreary island, she lived on, talking to Colonels.

A curious feeling: when a writer like S.B. dies, that one’s response is diminished. Here & Now wont be lit up by her: its life lessened. My effusion—what I send out—less porous & radiant—as if the thinking stuff were a web that were fertilised only by other peoples (her that is) thinking it too: now lacks life."
1933.12.17,"I finished part 4 of Here & Now yesterday—therefore indulge in a contemplative morning. To freshen my memory of the war, I read some old diaries. How close the tears come, again & again; as I read of L. & me at the Green: our quarrels; how he crept into my bed with a little purse, & so on: how we reckoned our income & I was given tea free for a treat. The sense of all that floating away for ever down the stream, unknown for ever: queer sense of the past swallowing so much of oneself. And today we make a loop with the past by going in our grand car to see Margaret & Lilian.

Well we are very happy. Life buds & sprouts all round us: by which I mean, everybody accepts if we ask them. Joyce Wethered would ‘adore’ to come; & on Tuesday Stephen Spender, Miss Lynd dine, & Plomer & K. Raine come in—all young, all new. And Vita lunches. And tomorrow I go to tea with the [Bruce] Richmonds. I think we live in a rich porous earth. I think we live very fully, freely, & adventurously. In short, what we made of that strange prelude is good.

The question that now fronts me as a writer is the war chapter. That I shall leave for a few days to simmer. No doubt the brew will spout out suddenly at Rodmell. We go on Thursday. This book therefore nears its end. Too thick a book.

I dined with Clive to meet Sickert the other night [15 December]. S. is sunk & old till warmed with wine. He scarcely eats. At last he expanded, & sang a French song & kissed Nessa’s hand—spontaneously; mine more formally. I think a difficult old man probably. But the ingrained artist. Therese modest, suppliant. Laughter—extravagance. How he was born in Germany, but not German. And lived at Munich till he was 8; & the German maid met the mad King who walked beside her, & she said—I forget. S. branches off. Then he went to Reading, a school kept by a drunken old woman, who beat a boy who had broken his arm. “And we 30 little wretches lay there cowed..” How far he wants me to write about him, I dont know. I suspect he is changeable: that he forgets. T. prompted him with words. She knows all his stories. He gets up at 5 & goes to his garage Studio at 7 & has difficulty in lighting his stove. He reads 3 papers. He wore a pilots cap with a green brim, but no overcoat, though it was freezing cold (I bought a fur coat by the way last week). He says one paints—let me see—the canvases galloped towards me. Angry with Agnew. Not a penny from that show came his way. Never again, he said. A fine Roman head, crisp hair, thick over the ears. Small dark eyes, broad forehead. “Oh Roger’s a darling—but dear me…” great jokes about Roger. Had wired to Lydia not to be a fool & try to act. “She’s thrown away her reputation. She had a great name with the public—now she’s lost it” Had lunched with the K⁠[eynese]⁠s. Maynard told them to listen to the WC. Sounds very audible. How she had her hour, & we must all learn to renounce, to give up: (here C. interposed one of his ring the bell sentences, about Virginia declining now from her glory & living with dogs: irritating as he meant it to be). And so we went on, a little wine-flown, but friendly & communicative, & living on our capital—I mean that we were all artists—free masonry. I cant feel very sure though of any fact or relationship; I’ve not seen him these 10 years, & then only to sing & joke. Yet he’s chiselled, severe; has read: was reading Goldoni he said. & Flaubert’s letters. And is Madame Bovary good? Is the Tentation good? I’m a literary painter, romantic—You are the only person who understands me—kissing my hand. So home in the frost to find Leon sitting with L.; & he sat & sat, propounding rather fumbling questions about literature, till at 1.45 I said I was cold, moved to the fire & he—very reluctantly—went. Younger, cruder than I thought; & I’m afraid, from reading his 2nd novel in MS, not so intelligent."
1933.12.21,"I guess that my Turgenev, over which I took such tremendous pains, is not much liked. Richmond’s thanks merely formal. So why go on with these essays? Why not invent a new method? I’m worried over Goldsmith. Cant be good to worry so much over transitions & packing in of ideas. But I have said this before, & say it now only because this is the relic of a morning when I should tidy, pack, write letters & so on. We lunch at ¼ to one, & then go, this yellow cold morning. No, longer the great transition that it used to be.

Spender & M⁠[aire]. Lynd to dinner: a free & easy night, but both notably young & at first deferential. S. has the makings of the long winded bore. Thats odd. A handsome poetic boy to look at—& very ardent, & a great egotist. Lynd silent, secretive, hobble tongued. She will no doubt become a scribbler too, like her parents. Foolishly perhaps I denounced scribblers.

It struck me that a very plain narrative might be interesting. Yesterday I wrote Goldsmith all the morning; we lunched; Pinka’s eyes are bad; we walked round the Square; then I shopped in Oxford Street; went to Warings; liked the china cups: think of buying a dinner service; home at 4: L. to mother [?]: I round to Nessa’s; Angelica cutting out silver paper beasts: Duncan entertaining Bradford Corporation, was given desert service; back to dinner, read a good MS by a man called Graham; heard a Haydon symphony; bed. A fairly specimen day. Letter from Hugh Walpole."
1934.01.16,"I have let all this time—3 weeks at Monks—slip because I was there so divinely happy & pressed with ideas—another full flood of Pargiters or Here & Now (odd that Goldie’s letter mentions that—The Waves is also here & now—I had forgotten). So I never wrote a word of farewell to the year; not a word describing the Keynes & the Jones’s; nothing about the walks I had ever so far into the downs; or the reading—Marvell of an evening, & the usual trash. And Clara died; & I sat with Mrs Woolf who said “She asked so little of life”—she crooned it, rather, lying in a daze. Nothing of that has been written; & now we are back again. (And have I a touch of the flue?) What a bore, since I am floating rather rapturously in the Raid scene & dont think that 3 days in bed would be at all useful. No doubt its nothing though.

Vita dined last night, & we discussed Sparrow’s book, she as always generously impartial: never takes sides, or lives in a set—a good example, though without my intensity of feeling (I add immediately to recoup myself). This is rather the style of Here & Now: my random rapid letter writing style. Lyn wants me to write for her; Ethel to lend my screen; that is the worst of one’s friends—these little unfair demands that make one turn on the other side in the middle of the night. But it is lunch time. This book, alas, must continue soberly in the same cover as 1933: too wasteful to begin another & leave all this blue paper blank."
1934.01.30,"At this moment, 5 to 4, Ethel Smyth is about to visit Leonard on People seen: Mary Hutch. Jack in evng dress: Ld. Castlerosse’s 8/6 cigar like a jackass’s penis; Nessa Angelica, Roger Duncan: Rose Macaulay, I. Davidson: Noel Coward Ld Ivor S. Churchill. Colefax’s: business, her infringement of the Pankhurst copyright I imagine; therefore I sit down here till 4.30 in order to escape. We have Tom & Tommie [Tomlin] dining; & I am going to say I shall call you Stephen. Rather a rush of people; & a dinner to meet Noel Coward at Sybyl’s on a cold foggy night. Nessa painting me again. Christmas mercifully over. Nessa very hard up. Question how to make money. Talk of some caricatures, issued between us. Rather an old wives talk. Children, money, education, ways of life; I with my curious penetration playing tentatively round her mood, & afraid to impose my own.

Yesterday I went to Shapland about my watch bracelet, L.’s birthday present; came back; sat; talked; Julian came to tea; read Young’s French travels: rather headachy; sleepy; strange trances in which I make up the last sentence read; to bed; sleep. Today, writing Here & Now, longing to end the Raid Scene, which draws out—hence my headache; then I shall palter with something: lunch with L.: went to Danish Laundry about his collars. A nice frank spoken woman. Collars may have, got among the white stuff. Women ironing. Back room with more women standing. Coppers I daresay downstairs. Looked at flats, L. home to print, I to wander to the Law Courts. Bevir Case being tried. Penetrated from end to end. Judges Chambers: a kind of vault. Kings Bench; &c. People scurrying; my sense of guilt at having no business there. So to bus; home, & found my bracelet."
1934.02.14,"But it was rather a bad headache: 10 days recumbent, sleeping, dreaming, dipping into oh dear how many different books, how capriciously: Thackeray, Young’s travels in France—but too many revolutions on hand actually: I dont want to read of them: I want turnips & peace & settlement; then a book a day from the Times, Berners, Selincourt & a stout life by Neale of Q. Elizabeth which pretending to impartiality emphasises the double chin & the wig of Mary at the critical moment: a fig for impartial & learned historians! All men are liars.

And so to Rodmell for the week end, & the bees buzzing in the hyacinths: the earth emerging very chastened & sharpened from winter under a veil; which became fog as we drove up, & is fog today. In addition, the house rings with the clamour of electricians: the new bath water engine being inserted; & then the Surveyor comes & says we are weighting the floors down with books: a heavy bill threatens; so out to buy ink for my new Waterman, with which I am to take notes for a new Common Reader; & Ethel Sands to tea—my first visitor. Yesterday I had Ivy Davison for the first time to write letters. No letters therefore today. Now I have just refused the Nat. Portrait Gallery offer to draw me, thank God, & am very cautiously revising Sickert."
1934.02.16,"Five minutes here before going to lunch with Nessa. A great Nelly row yesterday; which Thereby declare the last. It was about the workmen & her day out, & the end was that we had eggs for lunch & were forced to dine at the Cock [Tavern, Fleet Street], expensively & badly. No more of this, I say, & anticipate many days of. ill ease, some violent scenes, & then pray God, after Easter, peace.

Finished my Sickert article all the same. I put off Here & Now till next week."
1934.02.18,"And I began Here & Now again this morning, Sunday, at the point where I left off all but 3 weeks ago for my headache. Here I note that from 2 to 3 weeks is the right space. It has not gone cold, as after 6 weeks; I still carry it in my mind, & can see how to revise. It has gone—the talk during the Raid—running all over the place, because I was tired; now I must press together; get into the mood & start again. I want to raise up the magic world all round me, & live strongly & quietly there for 6 weeks. The difficulty is the usual one—how to adjust the two worlds. It is no good getting violently excited: one must combine. And I have the Nelly question on top of me in addition to the usual grind of what Ethel calls society. Some planning is therefore necessary. I have to ‘see’ Ottoline, Ethel, K. Furse, Ly Cholmondeley (perhaps), E. Bowen: Lyn comes to dinner tonight to discuss her rather acid & thin blooded bantling. And I’ve made up my mind what I’m going to say. I will write if she lets me tell the truth.

The new electric boiler in & boiling our bath water this morning. The K. of Belgium killed mountaineering. All last week they were fighting in Vienna: this somehow comes closer than usual to our safe London life: the people shot down, why? John came to see L.: as spruce as ever; & has left his poems. We went to Angelica yesterday, & ate eggs in Mrs C.’s large Adams room. A. has to speak on Mrs Pankhurst. We watched Lacrosse. A. despises all games."
1934.02.20,"To note the interesting stages of the duel with Nelly. Today I said, do you want this quarrel to go on? I would like it to stop now; but I shall discuss it later. Whereupon she said she wished it to end, but it was all my fault. And she wished to have nothing hanging over her. So I am indifferent calm & Lord knows if I shall shant give her notice tomorrow."
1934.03.04,"10 to eleven on Sunday March 4th—a fine day, no fog; & I’m to sit to Nessa for the last time in 10 minutes; & the house is being done, & we’ve taken rooms at Pippa’s, &—&.

As for Here & Now I’m going to start that seriously tomorrow. Kitty & Ed. in Richmond: this Chapter is to be visual & animal; spring; movement; plants; birds dogs; airs; flowers.

Yesterday at Ethel Smyth’s mass. The Queen in the box: nodding from side to side; Ethel in her 3 cornered hat beside her; with her hand up. The Q. bowing, doing her duty graciously. So to Lyons—I forget the mass—where in that sordid crumby room assembled the garish Ly Diana, Ly Cunard, & the pensive Ly Lovat & ourselves; amid clerks & shop girls eating cream buns. All rather strident & obvious & rubbing too much on one string as usual to be very interesting Yet it had elements—The great sun setting behind the trees in Hyde Pk. as we drove back. Oh dear me, L. is doing the books & wont let me help. Lydia’s Dolls House tonight; on Wednesday Nessa’s Private view; Sickert here to tea—rather a rusty rat trap that man with hard little eyes, very old—no illusions about his own greatness. “They’ll collect it all one of these days” he said, sublimely about his art critic⁠[ism]⁠s. My BBC Comtee suppressed—thank the Lord. No official positions for me. Now to sit.
"
1934.03.14,"I cannot hold out any hope for the next 14 days. Theres the workmen everywhere; theres Nelly gay & garrulous as a lark. Can I do it? I must. I must. And I caught an influenza—a little shivery bout at Monks on Sunday; cant screw my brain up therefore; & yet have the feeling that some magnificent chapters wait me. If only the 14 days were over—& I in my bed again! How human beings torture each other!

A black day, pouring rain; dirt everywhere. Let me see: there was a lovely day at Monks. There was the suffusion of blue in white cotton wool. Mr Lavender talked at the meeting about growing mushrooms. Ethel [Smyth] came over—to deposit her horrid gnawed bone or sucked chocolate—C. St John’s praise to wit—at my feet. A very ruthless shoving woman in some ways. And then on the crest of the Kitty Eleanor scene comes this shiver: bed; waiting for L.; cooking dinner. Back today & a man threw a parcel containing shoes at the basement window & broke it. A thief presumably. Lady Oxford wants to meet me at Ott’s. Mr Ridge the builder talking about Tenby & a little church on the rocks. The sea comes over the chapel floor. And he bought a picture in Holland Park for 7/6 that reminded him of Wales. Then the bookbinder. Thats my day. Now in the rain to Nessa."
1934.03.19,"I cannot describe how the Nelly situation weighs on my spirits. I am determined not to discuss it with L. either. She pressed me this morning. You show no confidence in me; you dont treat me like a maid. Oh dear—how tempted I was then to say Then go; but I bit my tongue. And then down here, trying to make it up. I couldn’t imagine it would be so hard & the worst to come. On the top of it this hammering painting, ordering of books. And I cant get into flood therefore with H. & N., though I had I think rather a brilliant flash this morning how to compact the rather fluid Eleanor. I shall have a shot anyhow. But Nelly spoils all. And to think none of this need have happened had I stuck to my guns 3 years ago! Now I must & will.

We went to Cambridge on Saturday, lunch with Dadie, Rosamond & Wogan; I ought not to call him that. He is jealous about R.’s fame: she not. So to An. & C. & there was Shephard [J. T. Sheppard] with all the little Eton boys, like the white chaps of a Christmas pig. A dragging weak performance. Lovely drive home in the twilight through the wide unmarked country. To dine with Nessa last night. Clive there. N. all a blowing & aglowing with the success of her show, & the money made. Then in came Lydia, all &c. too, owing to her success; & I felt so old so cold so dumpish, nothing flowery or fiery glowing in me owing to Nelly, but not jealous: I dont think that. Mynd [Maynard] very flown too, & Duncan too, & Clive quiet & now I think of walking round to Ott’s to meet Ly Oxford & if I can change my mood—rather a violent remedy. A clear wet spring sort of day. We went to Drews & bought Cashin’s present, then to L.’s hat & tailor; so home. All yesterday I did the dining room books. Today he is finishing the study & they are painting the stairs. Oh for the end of this chapter, for Rodmell & peace & freedom to use my mind again."
1934.03.26,"“The worst is to come”—that is with Nelly. Well it is now coming very near—by this time—3.30—tomorrow it will be over. Arid then there’ll only be the one dreadful day & we shall be off. I feel executioner & the executed in one. Meanwhile it is a brilliant spring day; I’m back in my studio, white, clean, more spacious, after 3 days of Pippa’s. Miss Walton is arranging books; Hugh, Stephen, William, Ott, & Vita all coming to tea & so on; I dine with Vita; then must ring up Eth Bowen about our Irish tour, & so the immitigable day passes. I face up to it without any evasion: this has to be lived I say to myself."
1934.03.27,"The great scene with Nelly is now over, & of course much less violently than I supposed. She stood by the drawing room door in the full light, white & pink, with her funny rather foolish mulish face puckered up. And I made my speech correctly, & even was able to say “And I expect you want to get another place too—” persuasively. She had one outburst—“I can say nothing—its all because it was my night out, & I asked you…” which I cut short & said we had agreed to part on good terms, gave her a cheque for £25 & a £1 note for my mending “but you dont owe me anything” she said, & so she went upstairs & I came down here. I suppose some further lamentation & argument, with L. perhaps is inevitable. But Lord what a relief now!"
1934.04.11,"I am a little proud of myself; for I have just read through the last pages, & now pat myself on the back, & say that I kept to my resolution, through thick & thin, & am now back here with Nelly gone, Annie upstairs, & Mabel, declared by Ha. to be a treasure, coming to see me tomorrow. So this has been definitely accomplished, after all these years. The sense of freedom & calm—no more brooding; no more possessiveness; no more sense of being part of Nelly’s world; & her planted there. Even if the cooking is less luxurious, that is all to the good. We had a horrid day last Wednesday—a fortnight ago; she trailed about, some how pathetic, to me, catching at me, & whimpering & revealing her own vanity. “But they’ll blame me—” However, she rattled off her spiteful little noise at L. when the parting came, thinking only of herself as usual; & there we left her in the kitchen, grasping a wet cloth; “No I really couldn’t Sir” she said, when L. held out his hand. How dazed & free & quiet I felt driving down to Lewes! She has taken with her all the cookery books, except too elementary manuals, & the chair cover—a last spasm of possessive spite."
1934.04.17,"So jaded am I after last night that I cannot add a word to my Sickert or make out a sketch of the last chapters of Here & Now. A high price to pay for a hurried dinner at the Hutches; racing to Macbeth; talking to Dodo MacNaghten; then to Sir Fred Pollock on the stage of Sadlers Wells.

An idea about Sh⁠[akespea]⁠re

That the play demands coming to the surface—hence insists upon a reality wh. the hovel need not have, but perhaps should have. Contact with the surface. Coming to the top. This is working out my theory of the different levels in writing, & how to combine them: for I begin to think the combination necessary. This particular relation with the surface is imposed on the dramatist of necessity: how far did it influence Shre? Idea that one cd work out a theory of fiction &c on these lines: how many levels attempted, whether kept to or not."
1934.04.18,"A curious little fact.

Instead of smoking 6 or 7 cigarettes as I write of a morning, I now, for 3 mornings, make myself smoke one only. And rather enjoy doing without.

Tonight Tom & Maynard dine to discuss Tom’s book; After Strange Gods. Julian & E. Bowen come in afterwards. I want to try & make myself write down the discussion tomorrow, as I am keeping off fiction."
1934.04.19,"Oh but I am much too sleepy to make even a brief note of the talk. It began at dinner. Tom & Maynard talking about his book. You have brought up again one of the primal questions, & nobody has even tried to consider it. No, said Tom, much like a great toad with jewelled eyes.

Morality. And JM [Keynes] said that he would be inclined not to demolish Xty if it were proved that without it morality is impossible. “I begin to see that our generation—yours & mine V., owed a great deal to our fathers’ religion. And the young, like Julian, who are brought up without it, will never get so much out of life. Theyre trivial: like dogs in their lusts. We had the best of both worlds. We destroyed Xty & yet had its benefits”. Well the argument was something like that. I pressed Tom to define belief in God; but he sheered off. Then Julian came. The economic question: the religion of Communism. This the worst of all & founded on a silly mistake of old Mr Ricardo’s which M. given time will put right. And then there will be no more economic stress, & then—? How will you live Julian, you who have no moral strictness? We Julian said miss your morality which has landed us in psycho-analysis, but I prefer my life in many ways. Maynard accused the young of being anxious to publish too soon. Thats to make our names & make money. We want to chip in before the talk has changed said J. V. Its because you have no sense of tradition or continuity. I used to feel that the British Museum reading room was going on for ever. I felt I could take 15 years over a book; I wanted to take longer & longer. Whereas you write & publish at 18. Tom agreed. Tom agreed to most of this, but reserved his idea of God. Eth Bowen came in, rayed like a zebra, silent & stuttering. Had also been brought up to repress, by moral ancestors. Is 34. L. said Jews with great morality but no religion. Quoted his mother on immortality. M. talked about Montagu Norman the Governor of the B. of E. an elf; an artist, sitting with his cloak round him hunched up, saying “I cant remember—” thus evading all questions, & triumphing—going away disguised—going mad. Also about Douglas, the credit man, being interviewed, & whenever they came to par. 7 saying “To explain this I must go back to beginning”.

M. on becoming a fellow of Kings. The moving nature of the service; how they go to the Chapel & lock the doors & sit in their pews, & then the Provost asks Mr So & So to come up & put his hands in his hands & reads out a statement, about preserving the laws & traditions, & then they all shake hands & he is admitted to the brotherhood, a society for research, religion, &c. education. And thus he is accepted as a brother whom they will support & sustain. This is a great moment; & there is nothing very ceremonious; religious; only an admittance. I said did this society, this coming together move him, & M. said very much. Kings was full of such societies: & feelings.

IRELAND"
1934.04.30,"Glengariff

This is the 30th of April, Monday, so I think, foreign travel not leading to thought. A mixture of Greece, Italy & Cornwall; great loneliness; poverty & dreary villages like squares cut out of West Kensington. Not a single villa or house a-building; great stretches of virgin sea shore; the original land that Cornwall & much of England was in Elizabethan times. And a sense that life is receding. At Lismore the Tchekov innkeeper said Theyre all going away & leaving their houses; nothing’s kept up since the war. So the old man on the island here said today—the very sad gentle old man who longed to talk. All gone—What good did the war do anyone? Only the Americans. And crooned & moaned leaning on the rake with which he was heaping up somekind of weed. Yes there is great melancholy in a deserted land, though the beauty remains untouched—miles & miles of Killarney—the lake water lapping the stones, the butterflies flitting, & not a Cockney there. Today, sitting on the verandah after lunch, the German lawyer having been forced to go to the Island—a string of touts loaf about pressing poetry & boats on one—after they had gone, the invalid, who reminds me of Nelly Cecil began to talk as they all begin to talk; & said she came from Limerick & when we asked if one could get a house there, she said—she laughed a great deal yet seems hopelessly crippled—“You can get plenty, but its not so nice when you have one.” “Servant difficulties?” I asked. “Ah, all that” she said, & one can see, after Bowen’s Court, how ramshackle & half squalid the Irish life is, how empty & poverty stricken. There we spent one night, unfortunately with baboon Conolly & his gollywog slug wife Jean to bring in the roar of the Chelsea omnibus, & it was all as it should be—pompous & pretentious & imitative & ruined—a great barrack of grey stone, 4 storeys & basements, like a town house, high empty rooms, & a scattering of Italian plaster-work, marble mantelpieces, inlaid with brass & so on. All the furniture clumsy solid cut out of single wood—the wake sofa, on wh. the dead lay—carpets shrunk in the great rooms, tattered farm girls waiting, the old man of 90 in his cabin who wdn’t let us go—E⁠[lizabe]⁠th had to say Yes The Ladies are very well several times. And we went to the wishing well, where there are broken cups as offerings & half a rosary & L. wished that Pinka might not smell, which made me laugh; & then I talked to the cook, & she showed me the wheel for blowing the fire in the windy pompous kitchen, half underground—rather like the Bride of Lammermuir—Caleb showing the guests nothing—no there was a fine turkey but everywhere desolation & pretention cracked grand pianos, faked old portraits, stained walls—& yet with character & charm, looking on to a meadow where the trees stand in a ring called Lamb’s Cradle. Talk too much of: the Chelsea bar kind, owing to C.’s—about starting a society called Bostocks, about Ireland with Alan, a good humoured bolt eyed fat hospitable man. So on here over the mountains. And pray God the C.’s dont show their gorilla faces at dinner or invade the old Squires library in which we sit."
1934.05.01,"Waterville [Butler Arms Hotel]

Too like its name; blowing the spray & the rain over a flat land, & a scattering of hideous 1850 watering place houses. Mist today, wind tonight; & L. opening the first Times to come our way, said George Duckworth is dead. So he is. And I feel the usual incongruous shades of feeling, one from this year, one from that—how great a part he used to play & now scarcely any. But I remember the genuine glow, from last summer when I went to see him—the thing that always made me laugh & yet was marked in him. But how little he meant, after his marriage—& yet how childhood goes with him—the batting, the laughter, the treats, the presents, taking us for bus rides to see famous churches, giving us tea at City Inns, & so on—that was the best which oddly enough returned of late years a little, with the Lincoln sausages, the bottles of eau de Cologne, the great bunch of flowers. Margaret I remember playing round him, & I thought how happy in their way they were. But this is all happening far off. Here I sit on my bed in the windy seaside hotel, & wait for dinner, with this usual sense of time shifting & life becoming unreal, so soon to vanish while the world will go on millions upon millions of years."
1934.05.02,"Glenbeith [Glenbeigh Hotel]

On again, after an extremely interesting encounter at the windy hotel with Ireland—that is Mr & Mrs Rowlands; he is a giant, very shapely, small head, obliterated features; she small, abrupt, vivacious. They began directly, & so we talked,—they accepted us as their sort, & were gentry, Irish gentry, very much so, he with a house 500 years old, & no land left. “But I love my King & Country. Whatever they ask me to do I’d do it”—this with great emotion. Oh yes, we believe in the British Empire; we hate the madman de Valéra.” There they live, 14 miles from Cork, hunting, with an old retriever dog, & go to bazaars miles & miles away. “Thats the way we live—no nonsense about us—not like the English people. Now I’ll give you my name, & I’ll write to my friend & she’ll tell you of a house—& I hope you’ll live in Ireland. We want people like ourselves. But wait, till the budget.” This she said, with all the airs of the Irish gentry: something very foreign about her, like old Lady Young, & yet in slave to London; of course everyone wants to be English. We think Englands talking of us—not a bit. No said the obliterated Greek torso, for such he was, when I was courting my wife—she lived in Liverpool—the young chaps used to say “now Paddy tell us one of your stories” but now they dont take any interest in us. But I’d do anything for my King & Country, though youve always treated us very badly.

So we got on to the Bowens; & established ourselves as of their sort. Yes I felt this is the animal that lives in the shell. These are the ways they live—he hunting all day, & she bustling about in her old car, & everybody knowing everybody & laughing & talking & picnicking, & great poverty & some tradition of gentle birth, & all the sons going away to make their livings & the old people sitting there hating the Irish Free State & recalling Dublin & the Viceroy.

On to Tralee & saw the gipsies coming down the road & thought of G. being buried."
1934.05.03,"Adare [Dunraven Arms Hotel]

Theyre looking out names on maps at this moment. “That gives us a very good idea of…. What I wd suggest if I might—tomorrow on the way—we’re coming down from Killarney tomorrow—then another thing, wd you like to go to Glengarrif—” (they are 4 fattish unattractive but kindly women—wont take our fire, we’re sitting in the hotel lounge after a long day driving & I certainly can’t read Prou⁠[s]⁠t with such a patter going on. We have a roasting great fire.

Listen, I thought you’d made up your mind to do this part first—well then tomorrow. Listen—wd this be too much of a—I dont want to break the springs of that car. Thats another idea—we’re going West.

To copy down conversation is not very interesting. People say the same thing over & over again. I wd like to describe the perfection of Irish conversation, which was Mrs FitzGerald’s last night. She is exactly the great French lady—only living in a black jersey on an Irish bog. After dinner she came in, ostensibly to lend us a paper & offer advice, in fact to indulge her genius for talk. She talked till 11, & wd. willingly be talking now: about hotel keeping, about frigidaires, about her grandmother sitting on a chair in the kitchen & saying Thats done that wants another 2 minutes & so on, never stirring herself but somehow getting it done. We have the name of being good housekeepers. Then on about bogs, she has bought several fragments because now there may be money in it. However I can give no notion of the flowing, yet formed sentences, the richness & ease of the language; the lay out, dexterity & adroitness of the arrangement. There was the story of old Julia the cook, who had gone off home in a huff jealous of the young maids; had her daughter & the London husband on her, bought them gramophone records, & now wont own that she has wasted her savings. Mrs F. is one of those bluntnosed parted haired Irishwomen with luminous brown eyes & something sardonic & secretive in her expression. Talk is to her an intoxicant, but there is as Mr Rowlands said, something heartless about the I⁠[rish]: quite cold indifferent sarcastic, for all their melody, their fluency, their adorable ease & forthcomingness. She was very much on the spot, accurate, managing, shrewd, hard headed, analytic. Why arent these people the greatest novelists in the world?—with this facility, this balance, this fundamental (now L. has joined in & is advising the 3 ladies. Are they American?)

Its very kind of you telling us: thank you very much. Now the wireless is brawling. Everything looks nice in fine weather. I think I’ll go to bed. I want you to read this. One is the director of the others, severe, but apologetic, perhaps paid for.

But why isn’t Mrs F. a great novelist? Certainly the salon survives at Glenbeith, the lust for talk, & finishing one’s sentence—only with complete naturalness. For instance, explaining the bogs, “saturated, now whats the opposite word?” Desiccated, L. suggested, & she adopted it with pleasure. She said one could never understand the Irish: one had to live as they did. They sit in their cottages talking about politics; they dont dance much; they have no amusements. They at once started to poach on her bog merely because she had bought it—otherwise it had been left alone for centuries. The bogs are full of trees, cant be self planted, so orderly, but now who has planted them? And they burn in a resinous way—go up—puf!—in a flash, like petrol. Suddenly she became severe & thought me a fool. “What does this good lady mean?” Her grandmother was an innkeeper; she herself went away for 25 years; Oh, as my grandmother said, one becomes able to read peoples characters before they step over the door, & ones never wrong one way or the other. Her quickness was amazing. This morning the talk began & L. very slightly put out his hand. “Oh I know that means you wanting to be off”—& so we parted from the last representative of the French salon of the 18th Century, this strange mixture of county lady, peasant, & landlady.

Oh but the Irish loudspeaker is inferior like everything else in this down trodden land. Things cant be worse, said the one armed man—his artificial arm wore a black woollen glove—who warned us off the river walk, & then showed us the full horror of Dunraven Castle, built from 1835 to 1850 like the rest of Ireland, a French Château in grey stone costing a million, & better razed to the ground.

Nessa writes that George before he died wanted Nessa & me to wire to him—which she did. What was in his mind? some old memory? some regret? I wonder."
1934.05.04,"Galway [Great Southern Hotel]

A phrase made this windy day: the clouds looping up their skirts & letting down a shaft of light. We picked bright blue gentians on the cliff looking towards the Aran Islands. This, though raining & cloudy, was one of our best drives—to the sea; views over folds of wild land with one or two orange & yellow white cottages: the sea blue, stone coloured or deep black: the waves tossing their hair back. People gathering sea weed & heaping carts. Extreme poverty.

So on to Galway which has 2 great bookshops, otherwise wild, poor, sordid. We saw the Claddagh; shawled women, coated men, all standing in groups together beside thatched huts, like islanders, waiting for a funeral. This the original Irish quarter; G. Thompson whom we found sitting before his Greek books in a little room looking on the sea came to the hotel after dinner & told us how they spend their lives in talk, dont mind poverty so much. He teaches 6[?] Galways Greek in Irish. Directly Galway May 5th 6 or 7th Sat. May 5th he went, at 11, up started a wild pale Irishman & poured forth more talk. “I hear you’re going to Dublin. Please dont miss the Guinness brewery or the 4 mummified nuns.” & so on. He was agent for a Radio Company & was touring Ireland; was Irish, but had lived in America; a mixture of Siegfried Sassoon & Robert Graves to look at, but internally preoccupied with breweries & nuns. Pouring wet; a gale; & off now to Dublin."
1934.05.06,"Dublin [Russell Hotel]

It is very windy wet & cold, & I am sitting alone after lunch in the lounge with a grey black netting woman. The scene is St Stephen’s Green, an Irish attempt at Lincoln’s Inn Fields, just as Merrion Square attempts Bedford Sqre & so on. We lunched at the Sherburne [Shelburne Hotel]; & there are the film actors; here they are too. Aran islanders, in thick tweeds, who sit over the fire downstairs singing what may be hymns. I heard Irish for the first time. This is a dreary waiting moment. L. has to write letters. Then, perhaps we go to the [National] Gallery. An air of inferiority sleeps or simpers or sneers or rages everywhere. A visitor from England brings back news of picture galleries, theatres. Here it is a mixture of Hampstead & Cambridge. At the Gate Theatre last night we were not sure which it was: there’s an edge of difference, & the play was good: about Emmett, advanced, pseudo-Auden, I imagine. Three instruments to make music. A curtain that wdnt close; much satire of the Irish love of bloodshed; satire of the attempts at culture; a sudden sense came over me of being in the midst of history—that is of being in an unsettled, feverish place, which would have its period given it in the books; anything may happen. Yet what can happen when the best restaurant in the capital is Jammets, when there’s only boiled potatoes in the biggest hotel in Dublin? Everywhere they seem to be living on watered wine. At last I gather why, if I were Irish, I should wish to belong to the Empire: no luxury, no creation, no stir, only the dregs of London, rather wish-washy as if suburbanised. Yet, I thought too at the Gate, they may have a spirit in them somewhere, that could make something, if freed. But they are freed, I continue—& indeed the play said, sardonically, & only this provinciality is the result. I dont believe in the songs of the Aran islanders, or in old men who cant read—that is, theyre not of necessity Homer. Their voices penetrate the glass door. The netting lady has let the fire out. The Arans are going out in full dress. I must run & see.

And I ran, & found a hot fire downstairs; & the old woman in the red shawl has moved off. Coming in yesterday I thought here was the cream of Dublin, meeting a cauliflower faced young man of redolent charm in the hall; and a fine bluff red genial man, & the little boys—heres the ancient aristocracy of Ireland, I said, but it turned out to be the producer—who lodges at the She⁠[l]⁠burne—& his troop, who lodge here. A quarrel is going on between a lady & the manager. Nothing in the wide world wd. have induced me &c. This is what upsets orderly composition & makes it impossible for me to finish—

Most unsatisfactory—will you look up my postcard—inclusive board—

No, it wouldnt do living in Ireland, in spite of the rocks & the desolate bays. It would lower the pulse of the heart: & all one’s mind wd. run out in talk. “Its awfully nice to see you & looking so well”—She’s off with a tall Irish gentleman & silence falls.

Merrion Square is about 3 times the size of Bedford Square; at one time a passion for glory must have settled on the Irish, & then having run up street after street of Bedford Row off they went. Doctors & lawyers have crept into the 18th Century shells. Oh but theyre now discussing the character of the lady who’s so angry. She’s handsome, she’s fine, but. who did she marry? & so on. Talk, talk, talk. Not as nice looking at all—in the good old days they used to come.

Grafton Street is not on the level of Sloane Street. The quays are much like the Paris quays. Bookshops. Long architectural vistas; one house after another, but some a storey too tall. Very broad streets. Our car too grand—this is what makes it impossible for me to finish Proust, I was about to say. Yet its been one of our most amusing tours. If only for the talk talk talk."
1934.05.08,"Worcester [Star Hotel]

We finished up Dublin in grand style yesterday. On the windy, indeed roaring windy Sunday we walked through Phoenix Park, where a crowd—this marks their lack of entertainment—watched a school of small girls playing hockey: had tea at Leixlip, pronounced Leeslip, an 18th century bare parlour, nice woman who had a child ill, & had been having a guest from Manitoba who said she was descended from the Kings—& then off we went down a leafy country lane—but the trees were lashing & one great bough fallen across the road—to Celbridge, where the famous interview with the blue eyes—I forget the phrase—took place. A girl said the Abbey was the big house down the road. It is a thick grey sham Gothic Abbey, but weathered now to look ancient, with sham Cathedral windows bricked up, & a great garden, all trees & bowers perhaps, leading down to the river. That was where she sat then; & she died here. But we could not see into the garden from the bank, & so drove home again.

The next day which was oddly enough, yesterday, for now time & the Channel have cut off Ireland, and here in Worcester, the ancient, rich, traditional, all that shifty poverty seems blotted out—yesterday we went first to the Nat Gall, of which I say nothing—the pictures are very highly cleaned—& then to St Patrick’s, where, over the door are the tremendous words; & in front of the door a diamond shaped brass, to mark the dean’s tomb. There beside him till a few years ago slept Stella; but the late Bishop, as the verger sarcastically remarked, pointing to his name opprobriously on the long list, decided that she was buried at some distance, & so moved her brass plate. I suspect this was prudery; & if Swift was buried in her grave, that seems to amount to marriage. Also her epitaph which he wrote, alludes to her being celebrated by him. However the Bishop moved them—& in prudery also Lord Guiness has cased all the old pillars of Irish marble in stucco, so that they look like South Kensington, & somebody else, of equal piety, has floored the whole building with black & red tiles such as there are in hotels—much to the dudgeon of the old verger, who, like everybody else, regretted the old days: showed us the stalls of the Knights of St Patrick, with their helmets & arms, one the Prince of Wales’s another the Duke of Connaught’s “but they dont come here now”— He too, like the shopkeepers & hotel keepers would gladly have done with the President of the Free State. “We dont want this hate—it does nobody any good” as the porter at Holyhead said to me this morning when he remarked how few cattle now came over. And at breakfast—the best I have ever eaten, because the coffee was good—I said to L. all the people themselves are sensible. Whats come over the politicians? And this we debated, & then took to the road in the wet & cold & drove in a downpour through Wales, through Shrewsbury (disappointing) through Much Wenlock (good) & much green & prosperous country, till we reached Worcester & took up lodging for the last time at the Star. L. told me not to stare so at the other tea drinkers, but I find it difficult not to gaze at these real English, these dwellers in the very heart of the land, who talk of horses & games all the time, & meet their men friends in the lounge, & sit drinking & laughing & bandying county gossip under pictures of famous race horses. Horses rule England, as salmon rule Ireland. In every hotel in Ireland sits a military man with poached egg eyes & sandy hair, a loud commanding voice, & spongebag coat & red slippers, after a day’s fishing. There he sits & drinks; & all day he fishes—landing salmon after salmon, if its at Galway, so that they lie along the bank, to the wonder of the intellectual German lawyer, whom we met again there. He told us he saw them fishing all day, & a day costs £2, & they must give back half the fish they catch, & so much on every fish caught to the man with the gaff. He marvelled. And thats what Ireland is kept for: in every place where there’s a river is built a large Inn, with town cooking & hot water & ladies & gentlemen’s lavatories, though there’s nothing but bog & hill for miles around, & there in the lounge the majors sit, & pay for the fishing, while the natives talk & talk & talk—about the old Kings of Ireland, presumably. Not that their folk lore is very interesting, Thompson said. An odd division of the country.

And here we are amidst the wealth of Worcester. Richer than ever it seems—this Cathedral city, set in the centre of ancient glovemaking & porcelain making, of Queen Ann⁠[e] guildhalls, with a girdle of the usual 18th Century ecclesiastical houses, indeed in Much Wenlock there is more ancient stone & carving & architecture to be seen than in the whole of Ireland.

We are very tired of hotels & glad that this is our last night, though the comfort is extreme."
1934.05.09,"[52 Tavistock Square]

This the 9th of May was our last day, & fine. So we saw Warwickshire—but I’ve been reading the Monologue & note how oddly another style infects—at its best: thick green, thick leaves, stubby yellow stone houses, & a fine sprinkling of Elizabethan cottages. All this led very harmoniously to Stratford on Avon; & all crabbers be damned—it is a fine, un self conscious town, mixed, with 18th Century & the rest all standing cheek by jowl. All the flowers were out in Sh⁠[akespea]⁠re’s garden. “That was where his study windows looked out when he wrote the Tempest” said the man. And perhaps it was true. Anyhow it was a great big house, looking straight at the large windows & the grey stone of the school chapel, & when the clock struck, that was the sound Shre heard. I cannot without more labour than my roadrunning mind can compass describe the queer impression of sunny impersonality. Yes, everything seemed to say, this was Shakespeare’s, had he sat & walked; but you wont find me not exactly in the flesh. He is serenely absent-present; both at once; radiating round one; yes; in the flowers, in the old hall, in the garden; but never to be pinned down. And we went to the Church, & there was the florid foolish bust, but what I had not reckoned for was the worn simple slab, turned the wrong way, Kind Friend for Jesus’ sake forbear—again he seemed to be all air & sun smiling serenely; & yet down there one foot from me lay the little bones that had spread over the world this vast illumination. Yes, & then we walked round the church, & all is simple & a little worn; the river slipping past the stone wall, with a red breadth in it from some flowering tree, & the edge of the turf unspoilt, soft & green & muddy, & two casual nonchalant swans. The church & the school & the house are all roomy spacious places, resonant, sunny today, & in & out [illegible]—yes, an impressive place; still living, & then the little bones lying there, which have created: to think of writing The Tempest looking out on that garden; what a rage & storm of thought to have gone over any mind; no doubt the solidity of the place was comfortable. No doubt he saw the cellars with serenity. And a few scented American girls, & a good deal of parrot prattle from old gramophone discs at the birthplace, one taking up the story from the other. But isnt it odd, the caretaker at New Place agreed, that only one genuine signature of S.’s is known; & all the rest, books, furniture pictures &c has completely vanished? Now I think Shre was very happy in this, that there was no impediment of fame, but his genius flowed out of him, & is still there, in Stratford. They were acting As you like it I think in the theatre.

Duffers the biographers not to make more hum & melody out of New Place. I could, so I think. For the man told us that after the great grand daughter’s death there was a sale, & why shouldn’t some of his things he said, be lost, put away & come to light? Also, Queen H. Maria, Charles the 1st’s Queen stayed there at New Place with the grand daughter (?) which shows how substantial it must have been. That he told us, & I had never heard. And he said Gastrell, the clergyman had the original house, wh. stretched across the garden almost to the chapel, pulled down because people bothered him, asking to see Shre’s house. And there (between the window & the wall) was the room he died in. A mulberry reputes to be the scion of the tree that grew outside Shre’s window. Great cushions of blue yellow white flowers in the garden, which is open, so that the living go on walking & sitting there.

[Diary XXIII]"
1934.05.18,"I broke off, after sticking my Irish papers into the old book, & felt I suppose a little shiver. Cant be anything I said to myself after all that holiday; but it was—the flue. So I had to resign all ideas—all flood of Pargiters & the glorious & difficult end of that book: all was blotted by the damp sponge; & now it is precisely a week since I went to bed, & here we are for Whitsun at Monks; whats more amazing is that I write this with a gold Waterman, & have some thoughts of supplanting steel Woolworth. It is a sunny voluptuous day, the birds all rasping, on their nests I suppose, & cawing on the trees & early in the morning giving loud & continued bursts of song, to which I lie listening. I hear L. going about the garden with Percy. All is calm & profoundly comfortable, owing to the absence for ever even in the background of grumbling Nelly, & her replacement by the steady silent unselfish Mabel. Yes, we do without a Char; we are free, serene, matter of fact, oh what a relief! So if I can pull my head out of the bog, I may go back on Tuesday to the 3 months immersion. But I take a day or two more to rest myself. How infinitely modest & disillusioned & without ambition of any sort I became, all because of influenza. Couldnt believe that anyone would come & see me, let alone that I could ever again string a dozen words. Now self confidence, conceit, the blessed illusion by which we live begin to return; very gently. Smooth serenity is the first stage which I will not interrupt by writing."
1934.05.22,"At last today, which is Tuesday, after striking the match on the box despairingly, sterilely,—oh I was so overcome with rigidity & nothingness—a little flame has come. Perhaps I’m off. This refers to the devilish difficulty of starting Part 7 again after the flu. Elvira & George, or John, talking in her room. I’m still miles outside them, but I think I got into the right tone of voice this morning. I make this note by way of warning. What is important now is to go very slowly; to stop in the middle of the flood; never to press on; to lie back & let the soft subconscious world become populous; not to be urging foam from my lips. There’s no hurry. I’ve enough money to last a year. If this book comes out next June year its time enough. The last chapters must be so rich, so resuming, so weaving together that I can only go on by letting my mind brood every morning on the whole book. Theres no longer any need to forge ahead, as the narrative part is over. What I want is to enrich & stabilise. This last chapter must equal in length importance & volume the first book; & must in fact give the other side, the submerged side of that. I shant, I think, re-read; I shall summon it back—the teaparty, the death, Oxford & so on, from my memory. And as the whole book depends on bringing this off, I must be very leisurely & patient, & nurse my rather creaking head & dandle it with French & so on as cunningly as possible. We go back this afternoon, & the summer lap therefore now begins in earnest; Mabel &c.

Out of sheer white mist we drove to Charleston last night & my numbed torpor became slightly incandescent. Benita there. Clive Nessa Duncan Quentin all talking at once about Spencer’s pictures."
1934.06.11,"That hopeful page reads rather too credulous now, since I went back & again on Friday following shivered, & ached, was stiff as a rod, talking to Elizabeth Bowen: 101: bed: influenza: & so lay all that week, till last Sunday to be accurate; & then went to Rodmell; & there began the chapter again, & had a sudden fuse of ideas & then there was the opera, the nightingale singing in the ilex tree, Christabel & Mr Olaf Hambro telling stories about the Queen & Prince; & a very hot concert yesterday, so I cannot, no I cannot write today. Patience, as Carlyle wd. say (in Italian). But consider—the whole system is so strained over this end, that one tiny grit, one late night, one too tiring day—takes away all rush, all fusing. And just as I saw it clear before me: the very intricate scenes: all contrasting; building up: so wait till tomorrow."
1934.06.18,"Very very hot; day altered so as to go out after tea. A drought over the world. In flood with Here & Now, praise be. Yet—very wary; only just now I made up the scene with Renny & Maggie: a sign I am fertilising, for I should be doing French for Janie, who comes at 5. Yes, & last night we sat in Gordon Sqre with Mary Baker—a timid housemaid little body, no birth or breeding, but 2 dogs; lizards on her terrace, & scorpions, which dont bite with their claws, but punch you & then bite; she had seen one, placed in a ring of fire commit suicide; very very hot it was, the Stracheys calling through the railings to be let in. Then James & Alix, all praising that scramble & scream of a party which I hated so: rather shocked that Nessa enjoyed it. So many young screaming drunks. Well, perhaps at 2 in the morning…. I forgot we had Aldous: a most admirable, cool, antiseptic distempered, but humane & gentle man: with age just tempering his brow: experience; but admirably mature, as we are not; has gone about the world, completely sceptical, all the more humane; judging everything, yet nothing. A little theoretical, about religion & sex; not for that reason a novelist; infinitely elongated & bony: his blurred grey eye; his malice & wit; talked of Sullivan, of Ottoline; Brett; then of the French noblesse; how he visits them; and they come down, amazed to find a VC: & he had spent a weekend at Welwyn with the Sex Reformers; taken off his clothes among the cabbages & read Waste Land. Necessary to say penis & fuck; but that said, no change follows. He uses every instant to the best advantage but has somehow solved the problem of remaining just, gentle,—a very sympathetic mind, & I’m glad I troubled to write to him—one of my rare fruitful actions; not to let things slip so much, to which I owe Aldous’s visit, & we are to meet in the autumn."
1934.07.02,"Rung up by Osbert Sitwell just now. After hopping & jumping about publishers, Holroyd Reece, lunches dinners & teas, he comes out with, “And can’t anything be done about this monstrous affair in Germany?” “One of the few public acts” I said “that makes one miserable”. Then trying, how ineffectively, to express the sensation of sitting here & reading, like an act in a play, how Hitler flew to Munich & killed this that & the other man & woman in Germany yesterday. A fine hot summers day here & we took Philip [Woolf] Babs & 3 children to the Zoo. Meanwhile these brutal bullies go about in hoods & masks, like little boys dressed up, acting this idiotic, meaningless, brutal, bloody, pandemonium. In they come while Herr so & so is at lunch: iron boots, they say, grating on the parquet, kill him; & his wife who rushes to the door to prevent them. It is like watching the baboon at the Zoo; only he sucks a paper in which ice has been wrapped, & they fire with revolvers. And here we sit, Osbert I &c, remarking this is inconceivable. A queer state of society. If there were any idea, any vision behind it: but look at the masks these men wear—the brutal faces of baboons, licking sweet paper. And for the first time I read articles with rage, to find him called a real leader. Worse far than Napoleon. Established for a thousand year says somebody. Meanwhile as I say the weather is brilliant, dry, hot; Clive gives a cocktail party, Bianca [Weiss] invites us to hear singing—& I get £300 this morning from Harcourt Brace."
1934.07.06,"Being unable to continue the P.s this morning, having indeed worked out that particular vein after 5 weeks writing I suppose, I went out & bought a pen with which I write, a Swan pen, on a broiling hot day, a real scorcher. And came in & found a letter from Stephen Spender praising The Lighthouse, & was made by that to think, have I written myself out, & so read the last chapter of H. & N. disconsolately—what a silly thing to do, since, as I’ve just said, I’m out of that mood. We go to Rodmell this burning afternoon, & yesterday we were at Reigate, being tried for the inconsiderate act of passing the cyclist. A great red municipal building: sunburnt country gents one wreathed with a gold chain on the bench: L. stood in the box. 3 pounds I heard them whisper, & so it was. The old gents had made up their minds long before that. No I dont like this pen."
1934.07.11,"I dont like this pattern⁠[?] any better I think; but no matter. L. says all Swans have soft snub noses. And this feels so but less taut.[?] The heat goes on—the burning dry heat. Mabel making jam sweats: I’m forced to take a cab just now; I’m writing about belief in a city church by way of a change. I’m letting the subconscious populate. So dazed & dusty: I rather think of marking time till August & Rodmell: where we take Mabel, shall have Louie Everest I think as permanent. We saw her last week end—a merry little brown eyed mongrel who came running to meet us in the road. Yesterday tea with Nessa; & the Morris’s there; today Osbert. I make these marks. & hear John’s voice in Miss West’s room signing his name. L. there.
"
1934.07.17,"I forgot to put in about the Colefax Row, curiously enough. How she wrote me a violent letter—better to break all together—can no longer have you in my life, because I put off dinner to meet Noel Coward. She pleads her most difficult life: Sir Arthur?

This is one of the dryest & hottest of summers. At it again this morning. And heat brings such lassitude; & people swarm. I have let them die out, be extinct: Osbert for instance; with his very sensual Royal Guelf face; his extreme uneasiness; his childish vanity always striking the two notes: rank & genius: so easily touched by praise, so eager. Told me the story of the lady in the pink hat. He lectures in the provinces, indeed rather likes the Prince in disguise part which he plays, staying with his dentist at Gerrards X perhaps. Well, he had a letter from Verena, to say she had always posed as familiar with him: would he lend himself to the deception & recognise her? She wd wear a pink hat. So he exclaimed, out loud, Oh Verena! what a pleasure to see you! The story would have gone better had she not been Verena. So he went off to swim for an hour before dining with Princess Mary & so on. A sensitive man; voluble; august⁠[?], uneasy; spending 6 months in China alone: & gushing words. Still I like him—why I dont know.

And then the Eccles’ on Sunday at Clive’s & the Whistler picture, & talk of Margaret, my little owl done by command; for I went to fetch the picture & there was old Dick, & Margaret & I sobbed—she so soft simple & stately—in the dining room of the hired house. A curious scene: some sincerity welling up after all these indifferent years. L. talking to bluff tough gruff Dick in the drawing room. M. to stay with him & see the beech woods of Highclere. Mrs Eccles the pretty daughter of Ld Dawson of Penn. C. called her an aristocrat. Clive very flighty & talking French. R⁠[oger]. looking under his eye at the Whistler. Dyou know, I’m getting less & less sure. I’m not sure of that arm: & there’s a certain flatness … No, I’d rather you asked Turner’s advice, which Clive explained, when R. went, because R. had been duped over a Whistler once, when Clive was in the right. Mr E. a slab faced agent de change: I put stockbroker in French because I’m rather slick in that language now, & have 2 weekly lessons from Janie. This is a real solid triumph, to have made myself face that curious fear—about French—& have now, I think, routed it.

Vita to lunch, after many weeks, yesterday, with her MS. which, L. says, is perilous fantastic stuff, a woman flagellated in a cave. How much will the public stand? She has a joke about the prostate gland which we are asking her to reconsider. She has grown opulent & bold & red—tomatoe coloured, & paints her fingers & lips which need no paint—the influence of Gwen [St Aubyn]; underneath much the same; only without the porpoise radiance, & the pearls lost lustre."
1934.07.19,"Is my brain dwindling, I ask myself after 1½ hours writing at the Fact & Fiction—that is, I am revising the first chapter of that old bugbear of mine on fiction. And I get so knotted & jaded; never mind. I shall lie flat a little in brain, for a few days: until I feel the well full. That is, I am priming myself for a final go at Here & Now. It is still so hot—so hot— my skylight painted smooth blue every morning—when we hear rain as we did last night we rush to the window. A puddle the rarest of sights. Smell of wet earth delicious. We drive to Cambridge to dine with Rothschilds tonight—home by starlight. Mary rings up to ask us to dine to meet Tom. How heavenly to drive by night she says. Cant because Jack wont. I did not go to Edith Jones cocktail or her party yesterday, & so felt assuaged; walked in Oxford St: bought a 15/- servants dress. Sun came out, though very soon: bought a melon therefore. How pleasant to have coins in one’s purse. On the whole a well managed summer, if my head were more vigorous. Oh these long books, what a tremendous effort they are—to whole [hold?] the entire span on my shoulders. And as Bogy Harris said, you must go on now till you die. Which is true.

No letters; no fame; rather a relief, to sit in the shade & spin. Julian trying for a Chinese professorship; will hear today. He dined & brought a skatelike looking woman—[name omitted]—a mouth cut in a wide fishlike face—entirely obtuse: sucking greedy. Why does J. like such inanities?"
1934.07.21,"A new nib. But I want sometimes to describe people, & here is our visit to the Rothschilds fading in my mind. We went down on Thursday, starting about 4.30, driving through that very spacious country that I always honour by planting myself down in a house in the midst of the corn. There are such houses; & the road runs by open unfenced fields. Why are fields always hedged off in England? The other way is much better: So to Merton Hall: a grey old house, half chapel, or college; half the usual rich young couples version of life: 4 kittens & a sickly pathetic marmoset; Barbara in a great hat, very pregnant, perched on a chair; long room, bowls of flowers, tea luxuriously spread at 6.30. I asked for a pale stale cup. She telephoned for the footman to bring long lemonades with gin—no without. And where is Mr R.? Asleep ma’am. Then V. came in, a slab of beefsteak, fat, thick, red lipped, in his open shirt. Sparring with B. about the rent they paid. Oughtn’t I to know? Don’t I pay it? & so on, partly for our edification. ‘Blubsy’ is one of his words. ‘Barbara went blubsy.’ Half asleep, he said, after a lunch party, Venetia Montagu & two of her lovers, one by the way Grey Walter, the son of our old cook. B. sat very upright, painted, like a cornflower. Wild, vivid; & then we walked about the garden, stuck like a jam tart—little square box edged beds with single flowers in them; a pretentious uncared for garden. Go & get your note book, he jibed: no I wont. Oh but she always has a note book. One thing a little shocked me; his saying, ‘I dont get much time for Barbara’. This he said perhaps boasting again, as he walked me down the narrow paths; he said he was determined not to become a specialist like the other science dons, thus spent so many hours with science, so many with books, which doesnt leave much time for Barbara. She had snapped at him; putting her heel down, when he wanted to tell me what Dadie had told her about—& the servant & the boy all in the same bed as—[names omitted]: no thats not quite it, but it was scandal on those lines. B. had been drawing (like Mary, I thought) Dadie’s confidences. As it appears from this, Victor told me the story, as we walked. Then dinner on the lawn, & they refused the ice: a luxurious decorative dinner. So in to the library: a steel bookcase packed with first editions, each sealed in a red morocco case; which we had out, Gulliver’s Travels, Boswell, Wordsworth, Swift, all laid on the floor; thousands of pounds worth, bought since last year, & I had set him reading with my Common Reader. Ah but this isnt the way to read, I almost said. Too easy; sitting at Sotheby’s bidding. But then youth has enormous power, I said, for I liked him, rather, her a good deal; she is the more sensitive & civilised, he the more robust & triumphant. Youth can have a child in September: nothing it cant do: has 50 years ahead of it, living in this very lovely England, & he said the R. fortune is now at full flood again. Shall he remain a scientist & refuse to be a financier? Thats the sort of question youth can ask. He wont live with these pickers up of minute peas in Cambridge. He said that his professor, aged 40, comes out to dine, & tells very old very dreary smutty stories, all his energy having been sucked up by science: so that is another argument against the specialist. Cant connect.

We drove home at 11, & got back at 1. A lovely cool shadowed drive through the fields again, two great steeples of light searching the sky about Ware, & an aeroplane sailing among the stars. Suddenly I saw a green star moving.

Duncan ill with very bad piles—operated on last night, or, since that sounds alarming, lanced. Spoke to Janie of the snobbishness of our sympathies. Cant really sympathise with that particular disease, though the pain is terrible. Must laugh.

I have just finished, the other pen continues, though very provisionally, the first truth telling chapter: but Lord knows if I must not entirely scrap the whole thing once more. At any rate I have now got a little fresh water in my well for Here & Now. I had one of my sudden rushes listening to Monti Verde last night. Last night came a letter from Henry to my dear Aunt Virginia saying that George has left me £100. I feel rather rebuked & uncomfortable, I dont altogether know why, at this final tip. Shall I spend it on what? Now I have so much money. And by the way Nessa came in, rather to my shame—but again, why?—only I like noting these queer waifs in my mind—dressed in a 3/6 dress she had made herself. I know what I am going to do now: I am going to come down with both feet on this dress mania: this shyness; this tremendous susceptibility: & it is not so very difficult, once faced.

I am reading Shre plays the fag end of the morning. Have read, Pericles, Titus Andronicus, & Coriolanus.
"
1934.07.22,"We went round, I continue, to fill in ten minutes on Sunday morning—a grey blue sky above the skylight, to Nessa with fruit; & found her sublimely in command of the situation as usual. Elly [Rendel] in a panic insisting upon a nurse: look at the haemorrhage; can you take the responsibility? Certainly I can said Nessa: anyhow I must. I’m not young, & I’ve seen bloodier bandages than these. This too at the nerve racking hour of dawn. So she triumphed. I doubt whether I could have. Perhaps. Walked as usual this summer in the Park; & saw the people playing bowls, & were happy to think that next week we shall have our own bowls. Also how shall we spend our legacy? Poor old George only left £7000 or so of money: what had he done with the rest? After dinner we listened to a very good concert; L. made cigarettes, & I followed my new diversion of book binding. I am covering Proust in little shiny squares of gummed paper that one buys for 6d at Kettles: a great relief to work one’s fingers. Letter from Elizabeth Reed—ecstatic, highfalutin, unreal, in spite of miscarriage on the moors."
1934.07.24,"Infinitely bored with correcting, or rather inserting a snip, into, my old Sickert for those pernickety Americans, who insist that Max shall be drag⁠[g]⁠ed in.

Dinner last night at the Hutchinsons. Let me see. Praise of my dress—taken very philosophically. Desmond there & Tom—dinner: not very good: one element of pleasure lessened. Talk frivolous at first. Jack’s; jokes with Mary for being in love with Arlen. He sends her books. I do not altogether like Jack’s jokes with Mary: her lovers &c. Then, Mary describes a party: a champagne cocktail. Tom gravely attentive. Talk gets upon whether we frighten or are frightened. Tom said I made him feel I saw through all his foibles; which perhaps I do. Talk of Patmore. Desmond expatiated, praised, placed him with Crashaw: described his love of great fires, his son Epiphany, all in the Sunday Times agreeable manner, not very close to the object: a love of little pictures. Jack robust, rather coarse; how old Victorians always had an eye to the main chance. Tom remained on the verge; yellow, bony; but I regretted having denounced the Rock—so much melancholy in his face. Yes, & then, somehow to Hitler. Desmond again describing Bottomley & Pemberton Billing. I always feel he flutters & skirts, where Tom dives to the centre. And there was Leonard aquiline & lean; & so Desmond drew on to politics, & the half wit wasps whom he watched in their Hive: Fascists that is: how Hitler had dealt them a blow. So to politics & then, what with Jack’s cross examination, & Tom’s intentness, & Desmond burbling general goodwill & human love, & Leonard’s specialised convictions, the argument blazed: how the Labour party wd come in: what it would do. But how can you make any such ridiculous claim Jack boomed. What is it going to do about unemployment, about agriculture? All these questions were put from the view of here & now, capable business men; L. ideal by comparison. How 10 sensible men ‘round a table’, one of his phrases, could so manipulate the supply of locomotives & wheat that one country supplemented another. Oh if we were all men of good will, if we were all ready to be nice about it—Then Desmond as usual praised moderation, tact, the virtues of the defunct Liberal party: how civilisation runs slowly in a great wide stream, & you must slowly facilitate its course, but by no means introduce whirlpools, cut precipices & so on. The deceased Oxford [H. H. Asquith], presumably, his ideal; but this is what so depresses & baffles me in him as a critic. They heckled L. between them, & when the argument began to put its tail in its mouth, Mary asked if I would like to withdraw. We went upstairs, & she sat on the fender, & said how, being alone for the week end she had tried to write an ambitious biography. There was to be an outer story, & a second meaning; as far as I could gather. But when she had called one character George Buchanan, & another Lettice Ponsonby, they died under her hands. Could one then try to write disconnected scenes? Must they combine into a story? No need whatever I said. And she clapped her hands, as if I had given her leave; & declared that she would write scenes, & send them to me. For instance there was Syrie Maugham’s party. As a person, she had not enjoyed it. I gathered that she had not had any intimacy. Then she reflected that she had danced every dance with an entirely different person: Freyberg, Arlen, & I forget who else; Lord Hambledon; had said the same thing to each; & each was entirely different. As an artist then, a dispassionate observer, the party had been a great success. Not to her as Mary. One must cease to be Mary.

Then the others came; & Tom read Mr Barker’s poems, chanting, intoning. Barker has some strange gift he thinks & dimly through a tangle of words ideas emerge. He thinks there is some melody some rhythm some emotion lacking in the Audens, & Spenders. Wants 5/- a week for this young man, who has wife & child. So home at last. The aeroplanes were droning in the sky all the time."
1934.07.27,"Rodmell begins again: with this difference, we have Mabel just arrived, this instant; & Louie [Everest], who is moving in today. And the usual helter skelter, tidying, & nothing to settle to; must at once go to Worthing, then come back to a meeting. Not the kind of day I much like, & would rather have no servant in the house; but we shall see. Also, my old brain must wake & bestir itself over Here & Now.

This is written to kill time, as I cant settle in. Perhaps we have too many possessions. Too many tables & chairs.

Mrs B⁠[artholomew], last night: has had her hair shingled. Propped against the door talked & talked. How difficult she found it to spend money though she now has it after all those years of stinting. Had given Annie a cheque. Also pays old Grey’s insurance. A queer genuine, though untamed, I mean uneducated spray—I mean so tremulous & wispish—something wild & vagrant; this becoming more quiet; in fact rather a nice sharp kind woman. Now she has a cheque book & draws cheques. Theres the money coming, she said. She wants to leave Rodmell. Percy doesn’t. She advertises for rooms at Colchester. Cant get them. So there it is, when we can afford to go we cant. But she has been very kind coming up to oblige, washing up doing the rooms. She cooks a bit of meat for Mrs Grey—whose [maiden] name is Squelch. Oh I’m too bothered & dithered—wish to sleep—but must go to Worthing instead."
1934.07.28,"ah hah—but now, having despatched that entirely disagreeable day, Worthing, & Mr Fears, representing Rodmell Labour party for an hour after dinner, I’m free to begin the last chapter; & by a merciful Providence the well is full, ideas are rising, & if I can keep at it widely freely powerfully I shall have 2 months of complete immersion. Odd how the creative power at once brings the whole universe to order. I can see the day whole, proportioned—even after a long flutter of the brain such as I’ve had this morning⁠[—]⁠it must be a physical, moral, mental necessity, like setting the engine off. A wild windy hot day—a tearing wind in the garden; all the July apples on the grass. I’m going to indulge in a series of quick sharp contrasts: breaking my bonds⁠[?] as much as ever I like. Trying every kind of experiment. Now of course I cant write diary or letters or read because I am making up all the time. Perhaps Bob T. was right in his poem when he called me fortunate above all—I mean in having a mind that can express—no, I mean in having mobilised my being—learnt to give it complete, not ju outcome—I mean, that I have to some extent forced myself to break every mould & find a fresh form of being, that is of expression, for everything I feel & think. So that when it is working I get the sense of being fully energised—nothing stunted. But this needs constant effort, anxiety & risk. Here in H. & N. I am breaking the mould made by The Waves."
1934.08.01,"I’m black & blue from their worrying,

They’ve tortured me early & late,

Some with their love,—God help me!

The others with their hate.



Why I trouble to copy out these [untraced] lines which are from Heine, I dont know, except that they represent what happened to my perfect free day at Charleston yesterday. One ought not to have the illusion of perfect happiness—that it is possible; yet again I did. And then, yes my friends—this is Sybil Colefax sneering to Clive at my taking too much care of myself; & this is Clive handing it on; & then this morning, poor old Francis [Birrell] paralysed; another operation tomorrow, under which says Nessa, it is to be hoped he may die, since the cancer has come back. She sees him today. How odd, ones last day, this: here very hot & fine. & then of course he may live. How I hate going through these thoughts again, & what a jumble of meanness & sordidity & the fine, one’s feelings are.

Remember, as far as S⁠[ibyl]. C⁠[olefax]. goes, never never to speak of health. In, fact this might be useful in all connections."
1934.08.02,"My mind, only how call it so solid a name, still running not upon dear old Frankie, who may be dying—but our convention is to be very cheerful & objective—but upon that gnat Sybil. Why didnt I remind her when I wrote of the way she treated me, how she put me off twice here. What a stinging rejoinder that would have been—& I only thought of it yesterday. But perhaps I can still get it in. A curious problem: why was I not even mildly annoyed at the time, & now, in August, why am I acutely irritated. Clive’s drop of poison, I suppose, managed to crystallise the whole thing; the oddly vivid & upsetting effect of knowing that one’s been talked about. The reflection of myself in Courtauld’s drawing room, being made the subject of her & Clive’s jeers & sneers. But I dont mean to have another row, à la Eddy.

And this fly in the eye makes it impossible for me to see—no, thats not true, I can ‘see’ the nursing home, the bed, the surgeon; I can act ones last night, & being waked early in Welbeck St & all that—my eye is quite remorseless—but I dont feel. However, these flies gradually dismember themselves, & perish.

I’m worried too with my last chapters. Is it all too shrill & voluble? And then the immense length, & the perpetual ebbs & flows of invention. So divinely happy one day; so jaded the next.

Louie’s first morning here. A leap in the dark rather. Mabel making currant jam. Vast basins of black currants which she heads & tails. Mabel had a chicken that lived with her 14 years & was called Old George."
1934.08.04,"Waiting about to go to Annie’s wedding. No signs yet. No bells ringing. So impossible to do anything, & here I am at 11 this hot August morning in full garden party dress. No news of Frankie. The tap tap of the boys playing cricket reminds me of our cricket sensations. What is the difference between memory, excited by sensation, & thought—the thought required by a page of Plato for instance?

Yesterday just as we had done tea, Adrian’s gaunt form appeared; Karin’s touseled shape, grown very thick & large. Her inferiority complex takes the form of praising Adrian. Clever old Adrian, she exclaims, if he bowls a good bowl. This is by way of saying—what? My marriage was not so bad after all? He remains perfectly unmoved, quiet, sensible; I suppose curiously immature, though able to go through all the actions correctly of a grown man, father, husband.

The night before, Enid Jones rang up & came, from 9.15 to 10.45 to discuss her book—the effect of winning the Grand National on a child, ostensibly; really another case of inferiority I think; to rub off the taste of Goodwood with Scatters Wilson. Like a dog eating grass. But why shd she need to eat grass? Because, being a scallywag she married a very rich man: is neither fish flesh fowl nor good red herring; & thats an ambiguous state that requires perpetual adjustment. She shifts from self to self. We have to provide a transition. An uneasy woman, rather hard. Brandishes all her children all her responsibilities all her gaieties in our face. Uncertain whether to stay or to go.

Clive & Julian & so on to tea today. I will swear not to pick up one of the thorns so artfully administered by the Pismire—slipped in. George ring the bell & run away. I will carefully observe his method & analyse it in action.

Saxon very glad to come here next week end. We take up a conversation broken these 10 years in our natural voices. What about Pericles? & so on. A relief after Sybil’s histrionics.

Certainly bright leaves do glare as Rupert said. No sign of the wedding yet. I think of the craving of the human being for sympathy."
1934.08.07,"A rather wet Bank holiday. Tea with Keyneses.

Maynard had had teeth out, but was very fertile. For instance: “Yes, I’ve been 3 weeks in America. An impossible climate. In fact it has collected all the faults of all the climates. This carries out my theory about climate. Nobody could produce a great work in America. One sweats all day & the dirt sticks to ones face. The nights are as hot as the days. Nobody sleeps. Everyone is kept on the go all day long by the climate. I used to dictate articles straight off. I felt perfectly well until I left. The shipwreck was all the Captains fault. We made a bee line for the Lightship in a fog. He had the boats launched before we struck. We had the men out of the water before they were in it. Very efficient, but not a good captain. A character. A Don Juan.” So to German politics “They’re doing something very queer with their money. I cant make out what. It may be the Jews are taking away their capital. Let me see, if 2000 Jews were each to take away £2,000—Anyhow they cant pay their Lancashire bill. Always the Germans have bought cotton from Egypt, had it spun in Lancashire: its a small bill, only ½ a million, but they cant pay. Yet theyre buying copper all the time. Whats it for? Armaments no doubt. Thats one of the classic examples of intn trade—Now Holden has been over & says we wont go in. 20,000 people out of work. But of course there’s something behind it. What is the cause of the financial crisis? Theyre doing something foolish—no Treasury control of the soldiers.”

(but I am thinking all the time of what is to end Here & Now. I want a Chorus, a general statement, a song for 4 voices, how am I to get it? I am now almost within sight of the end. racing along: becoming more & more dramatic.

And how to make the transition from the colloquial to the lyrical, from the particular to the general?)"
1934.08.12,"This is Saxon’s week end. He is in the house, this windy cold gray day, playing chess with L. Odd that I should think of ‘honey-sweet’ Queen in connection with Saxon. But he has grown rather pink & chubby in face, & very mellow & in fact charming in mind. The old eccentricities have been melted in the sun—I cannot guess of what success. Is it The Treasury, or Mrs Sickert? Anyhow he is not merely a bundle of desiccated separate remarks about toothbrushes & trains: he is continuous & even suggestive. I have spent an hour or so talking with him about Shakespeare, books in general, then people: & there is some virtue in these old friends: I mean conversationally; they enrich. If I ask what about Francis? he can supplement my question with all his knowledge of the past; & that is joined to my knowledge; so that we say many things we mean. Thus, it was a good idea of mine to ask him. He stays away a good deal, it seems; has rather expanded into queer corners; the Beresfords & the Lambs. And he has bought a new book on Aristotle. Barbara [Bagenal] & her children the bulls eye I imagine. But the other circles all to his liking. We had the Keynes’s over. Old friends again. M. adroit & supple & full of that queer imaginative ardour about history, humanity; able to explain flints & the age of man from some book he has read. Silent while we gossip. Immensely amused too by little scenes, as of Mrs Hardy & the sausages [unexplained]. He complained that great men, Shaw & Wells, are not serious; they do their stunt. Why cant they be simple, & do no stunt? He said Shaw never said anything new, but Charlotte [Mrs Shaw] does. He has a ranging adventurous mind, which I enjoy. In short we old stagers have made a good job, on the whole—such was my feeling. They stayed late.

Duncan is still bad with the ridiculous torturing disease, & Nessa I suppose much worried.

New⁠[s] at first, through Julian, extremely optimistic about Francis. Now nothing, but perhaps more doubtful. Oh & the drought has broken: 2 carp are dead; there is the old ugly grey welter in the sky, which I’m afraid may now become ‘weather’. But all, at this moment, rather loose, random, interesting. Vita came over very late for dinner, having been kept by a row with her mother who, says M⁠[aynard], eats pate de foie with a shoehorn. She had been accusing her footman, a cocktail party boy with fair hair called Leonard, nicknamed Lemon, of putting Lysol in her medicine. Vita thinks Harold is getting soft & domestic, because he talks of grandchildren, & wants to have a butler to brush [h]⁠is clothes & a spare room. Good Lord said Vita, as if I wanted grandchildren! for which exclamation I like her. In fact she wears, to me, in spite of G⁠[wen]. & the Dark Island, very well. So in to roast beef & plum tart."
1934.08.17,"Yes. I think owing to the sudden rush of 2 wakeful nights, making up early mornings rather, I think I see the end of Here & Now (or Music, or Dawn or whatever I shall call it). Its to end with Elvira going out of the house & saying What did I make this knot in my handkerchief for? & all the coppers rolling about——

Its to be all in speeches—no play——I have now made a sketch of what everyone is to say; & it ends with a supper party in the downstairs room. I think the back is broken.

It will run to something like 850 of my rough pages I imagine: which is at 200: 850

200

170,000 & I shall sweat it down to 130,000.

The boat came yesterday & Julian & I walloped about on the river. An expensive sail—£7.7.6 to be exact. Thats what comes of saying lightly I’d like a boat. But never mind. I have George’s legacy, & even if H. & N. cant be published till Oct. year, still I have £1000 or thereabouts saved.

Mabel, called now The Cow, is stiff with neuritis & very ‘low’ as she calls it. A very sociable summer this. I have not entered High Salvington: seeing the down made into Putney & a pneumatic drill at work; & the scented room; & Ada like a double guinea pig, pale hair en brosse; going over the windmill—such a drive & such a visit as branded itself like a new cheap villa on my brain.

But I am thinking of H. & N. & it is lunch time."
1934.08.21,"Having taken a week off, in the middle of the last scene, which is indeed like a scene in a play, I am too jaded to write that horrid book, I mean Fiction, this morning—

Last night the ice was hard, & we decided that Mabel must go. She is a dump. She wears her shoes on one side, & has long black stockings. Also there was a hot violent gale. It was a bad day of its kind, & I dreamt ferociously all night; about Massine; & Wilmington, & woke with all my back in hackles, like a cats, & the old cry Fight: upon wh L. opened the door; no letters; only burnt bread—& so I had ½ an hour in the kitchen which is crumby, with Mabel, & now I cant think: I shall moon the day away. This is what comes of driving ahead at that last chapter. It is very concentrated. I read Une Vie last night, & it seemed to me rather marking time & watery—heaven help me—in comparison. Its the change of gear that so upsetting⁠[?] Like a smash in a car; being spilt from one world to the other.

I shall go in & get a book & my watch & moon away the morning & pray for a good dinner. The week end will be intolerable. Plomer & Lyn, neither of whom do I wish to see. We are using the new room for the first time.

The lesson of Here & Now is that one can use all kinds of ‘forms’ in one book. Therefore the next might be poem, reality, comedy, play: narrative; psychology, all in one. Very short. This needs thinking over.

Also, a play about the Parnells,

or a biography of Mrs. P."
1934.08.26,"Plomer & Lyn are talking outside the window. They are sitting in the walled garden, on the chairs we bought yesterday. We have left them there to read. We have supplied them with Ethel’s books, with Blind men cross the Bridge—an immense long totally absurd (work of genius the Lit Sup calls it) novel; but now they have ceased reading—indeed it is rather windy—& are talking. I catch only a word now & then. Lyn has just said that she “immensely enjoyed it”. What, I wonder?! doubt that she immensely enjoys anything. She is rather faded & suppressed & literal & conscientious wearing her horn spectacles & frowning. William I think (but L. disagrees) rather aged & disillusioned. But, against my forecast, I am enjoying the week end. For one thing the cooking has been good; Mabel ‘a treasure’. With Louie to help we live in greater comfort than any time these 5 years. Ethel came over to tea yesterday and did her owl—who is a red wattled turkey cock—very vigorously. In fact she adds considerably to the entertainment of the week end. We sat & bawled, about God & Dulwich. She only had time for half a remark about the Prison & her complete lack of ambition.

Thursday was a horrid day though, when we took Julian Angelica & Susan to London, on a windy day; & I had toothache & went to the dentist, & he says I must have 2 teeth out; & everything went as a nightmare—ending, after a bitter cold drive with a most depressing view of family life at Charleston, which I arranged into a climax of domesticity & was thoroughly irritated with Duncan for making Nessa into Aunt Mary—cant come here, cant go to London as long as he is ill; & with Nessa for her passive submission; & with myself for being the good fairy Aunt. Lord how that role can bore me—how unreal it is—& why do I act it? These were my thoughts, soothed mercifully after dinner alone by Leonard."
1934.08.27,"The week end better. I am trying to start the nameless book again; & of course find it grinding, to try to get back into those stiff boots. All the same, I enjoyed the week end. Lyn left; which was all to the good, as she has no great range poor Lyn, & W⁠[illiam]. had, I guessed, said all he could say. Then [Neil] Lyons came, & subtly pervaded the house with a smell of stale cabbage. “At Jimmy Gunn’s cocktail yesterday …. I said to Sickert—. dining in Mayfair.” He is not merely secondrate, but almost criminal; which is amusing, once in a way. A South African Jew & sharper, Wm said. Probably the son of a small tailor. Stammers on the letter A. has a sexual delusion. He told us of a small hat black woman, who; divorced her husband, 6ft 4 & in the Guards, lives at Uckfield & leaves Neil at 2. am. She drives through Lewes & blackguards the police. He would not repeat the word she used. Then Lavender the gardener is an ex-burglar: has done 14 years in gaol, & is a preventive detention man, under charge of Hancock. (This ex burglar came round the other night to borrow 15 /-). He—Neil—has his prattling amiability though, & amused me with his stories of making cigarettes & gathering samphire. A nimble light fingered little monstrosity, much concerned to amuse, to impress, & much afflicted with various desires. He eats corn cobs; & may unhappily come round to bring me some, & show off his cigarettes. What a dip in the kitchen pail!

Wm. gone this morning. I doubt that I have anything to add to the portrait of Wm. save that I think he is losing charm, & perhaps adding weight. Another novel coming this autumn. No reference to the Press. Lyn gave him a scrap of her own hand to decipher, which I thought unfair."
1934.08.30,"If I cant even write here, owing to making up the last scenes, how can I possibly read Dante? Impossible. After 3 days grind, getting back, I am I think floated again.

Robson comes to tea today; & the Woolves tomorrow; & … another lapse making up El’s speech .. “D’you know what I’ve been clasping in my hand all the evening? Coppers.”

Well anyhow I’ve enough in stock to last out this Chapter; I daresay another 2 or 3 weeks.

Yesterday I found a new walk, & a new farm, in the fold between Asheham & Tarring Neville. Very lovely, all alone, with the down rising behind. Then I walked back by a rough broad overflowing grey river. The porpoise came up & gulped. It rained. All ugliness was disolved. An incredibly 18th century landscape, happily making me think less of Wilmington.

A tremendous hail storm after tea. Like white ice; broken up: lanced, lashing, like the earth being whipped. This happened several times. Black clouds while we played Brahms.

No letters at all this summer. But there will be many next year, I predict. And I dont mind; the day, yesterday to be exact, being so triumphant: writing: the walk; reading, Leeson, a detective, Saint Simon, Henry James’ preface to P. of a Lady—very clever, [word illegible] but one or two things I recognise: then Gide’s Journal, again full of startling recollection—things I cd; have said myself."
1934.09.02,"I dont think I have ever been more excited over a book than I am writing the end of—shall it be Dawn? Or is that too emphatic, sentimental. I wrote like a—forget the word—yesterday; my cheeks burn; my hands tremble. I am doing the scene where Peggy listens to them talking & bursts out. It was this outburst that excited me so. Too much perhaps. I cant make the transition to E⁠[lvir]⁠as speech easily this morning. Another lull; but very slight, caused partly by the great tea table talk yesterday—9 to tea; Ks. B’s. Ky Martin & Kahan, the economic Jew, I forget his name. We arranged lots of little cakes on two tables. And some came early, others late. And they talked (as in my book that morning) about Civilisation, owing to L.’s article on Shaw, which had, as usual upset Kingsley, even to the extent of making him consider giving up the NS. & taking a professorship. “For whats the use of the NS. if there’s no future for our civilisation?” What use is there for professors in that case? Clive inappropriately tried to flirt with that scrannel woman Olga. A wrung out washerwoman’s hands woman. And K⁠[ingsley]—so histrionic, so effusive. Lydia oppressed, I thought, by the death of Cecchetti. And Maynard by his week end party. The men played bowls. The girls, including M⁠[aynard]—sat in the upstairs room. But Olga made us restrained.

I am very calm & worldly competent at the moment though. I rather like those made up words. Single words too precise. Annoyed by Duncan’s scare—a temp: must be consumption & so on. Now the specialist says nothing of the kind, as I cd. have told them. Strange to be irritated by this: but I am."
1934.09.12,"Roger died on Sunday. I was walking with Clive on the terrace when Nessa came out. We sat on the seat there for a time. On Monday we went up with Nessa. Ha came. Nessa saw Helen [Anrep]. Tomorrow we go up, following some instinct, to the funeral. I feel dazed: very wooden. Women cry, L. says: but I dont know why I cry—mostly with Nessa. And I’m too stupid to write anything. My head all stiff. I think the poverty of life now is what comes to me. a thin blackish veil over everything. Hot weather. A wind blowing. The substance gone out of everything. I dont think this is exaggerated. It’ll come back I suppose. Indeed I feel a great wish, now & then, to live more all over the place, to see people, to create, only for the time one cant make the effort. And I cant write to Helen, but I must now shut this & try.

Maupassant, on writers—(true I think).

“En lui aucun sentiment simple n’existe plus. Tout ce qu’il voit, ses joies, ses plaisirs, ses souffrances, ses desespoirs, deviennent instantanément des sujets d’observation.. Il analyse malgré tout, malgré lui, sans fin, les coeurs, les visages, les gestes, les intonations.”

I remember turning aside at mother’s bed, when she had died, & Stella took us in, to laugh, secretly, at the nurse crying. She’s pretending, I said: aged 13. & was afraid I was not feeling enough. So now.

1934.09.15,"I was glad we went to the service on Thursday. It was a very hot summers day. And all very simple & dignified. Music. Not a word spoken. We sat there, before the open doors that lead into the garden. Flowers & strollers which Roger would have liked. He lay under an old red brocade with two bunches of very bright many coloured flowers. It is a strong instinct to be with ones friends. I thought of him too, at intervals. Dignified & honest & large—“large sweet soul”—something ripe & musical about him—& then the fun & the fact that he had lived with such variety & generosity & curiosity. I thought of this. Karin annoyed me coming in late, stumbling. That went off. They played Bach. Then the coffin moved slowly through the doors. They shut. They played again—Anon, I think: old music. Yes, I liked the wordlessness: Helen looking very young & blue eyed & quiet & happy. That is much to remember her for. I kissed her on the lips, in the courtyard. Then Desmond came up: said wdnt it be nice to walk in the garden? “Oh we stand on a little island” he said. But it has been very lovely I said. For the first time I laid my hand on his shoulder, & said dont die yet. Nor you either he said. We have had wonderful friends, he said. We walked a little, but Molly was out of it, with her deafness. So we took them to Wellington Sqre & had tea. A merry natural talk, about Roger & books & people, all as usual: Molly breaking in, about her philograph, & her books. Queer isolation of deafness—breeding this rather peevish but pathetic egotism. And it was roasting hot. D’you remember the dinner we gave the Memoir Club said Desmond in the street—looking at his dinner table. Never again said Molly. Oh yes, I said; & we drove off.

Very jaded; cant write; all my books seem a complete jerked⁠[?] failure. I must take a few days off. Ann & Judith upon us: then Dadie."
1934.09.18,"Dadie has been gone half an hour, & I am silent after talking incessantly, it seems, & is in fact almost true, since 1 on Saturday. A. & J. came, strode in without their box. Great brown naked legged colts. Then there was Mrs Jones & Hugh: bowls: I sat & listened to the poor womans plaints; knees that lock, cant make eno’; will I give her work; in a bungalow at Seaford. Then dinner: next day Angelica’s party (like the Lytton party) at Charleston. They acted; I did my poor old frenzied owl; at parting Clive, who is off to Spain till November, said But you’ll get over it—an arrow wh. stuck, for then I felt I had over acted. Never mind. Nessa infinitely mournful & struck, like a statue, something frozen about her. Janie. The children also saddened (not A. & J.). They acted very beautifully in Chinese clothes by the pond. Well I thought I can see this through Roger’s eyes: its right to enjoy every tint. And yet how can one? This has gone out of the day—that laughter; that energy; & we were all thinned & stunted. So home. And then after A. & J. went—& I had begun to fidget because they dont wipe their mouths & eat so much—the Keynes’s & Dadie came. We did not exactly repeat the funeral talk: but it loomed over us. Lydia to me rather jarring. She did not care. Nothing much loomed over her. Dear old Dadie very charming & affectionate. We talked about Cambridge; about teaching English; I held out a bare pole—I mean extended my views rashly; he was donnish, serious, very measured; believes in education; in measuring the mind, & sending youth out to Africa with ‘an improved sense of leisure’ & so on. But this rather broke down, & he admitted that he means to leave as soon as he can afford it. Peter [Lucas] a deathly warning. Teaching without zest a crime. Shepherd a complete buffoon; but good, because of his completeness. Dadie wants to marry, to have whitehaired children & live a romantic life with a dark haired feminine wife. As it is has to comfort his most desolate mother.

I like writing this morning because it takes off the strain on the lips. A cold dull day after all this blaze. Now we have [John] Graham—& Mrs W⁠[oolf]. but then, perhaps, peace, & an end to the book? O if that could be! But I feel 10 miles distant—far away—detached—very jaded now."
1934.09.19,"I had a notion that I could describe the tremendous feeling at R.’s funeral: but of course I cant. I mean the universal feeling: how we all fought with our brains loves & so on; & must be vanquished. Then the vanquisher, this outer force became so clear; the indifferent. & we so small fine delicate. A fear then came to me, of death. Of course I shall lie there too before that gate, & slide in; & it frightened me. But why? I mean, I felt the vainness of this perpetual fight, with our brains & loving each other against the other thing: if Roger could die."
1934.09.20,"But then, next day, today which is Thursday, one week later, the other thing begins to work—the exalted sense of being above time & death which comes from being again in a writing mood. And this is not an illusion, so far as I can tell. Certainly I have a strong sense that Roger would be all on one’s side in this excitement, & that whatever the invisible force does, we thus get outside it. A nice letter from Helen. And today we go to Worthing—dear me, that poor old very superficial content with the outsides & shows of things woman. Who never grasps anything but lives like a butterfly unable to retain or reflect; but abundant genuine of its kind unreflecting feeling. I shall have to hear all her sorrows, & ‘cheer’ her up: which happens quite easily. A cake, a [word illegible] a compliment—chatter.

[Later] As a matter of fact she was unexpectedly sensible & rather sympathetic about Roger. She said how terrified she had been when she came to see me first at B⁠[runswic]⁠k Sqre—how she had been impressed by my tapestries—had never seen such stuff."
1934.09.30,"The last words of the nameless book were written 10 minutes ago; quite calmly too. 900 pages: L. says 200,000 words. Lord God what an amount of re-writing that means! But also, how heavenly to have brought the pen to a stop at the last line, even if most of the lines have now to be rubbed out. Anyhow the design is there. And it has taken a little less than 2 years: some months less indeed, as Flush intervened; therefore it has been written at a greater gallop than any of my books. The representational part accounts for this fluency. And I should say—but do I always say this?—with greater excitement; not, I think of the same kind quite. For I have been more general, less personal. No ‘beautiful writing’, much easier dialogue; but a great strain, because so many more faculties had to keep going at once, though none so pressed upon. No tears & exaltation at the end: but peace & breadth, I hope. Anyhow, if I die tomorrow, the line is there. And I am fresh; & shall re-write the end tomorrow. I dont think I’m fresh enough, tho’, to go on ‘making up’. That was the strain—the invention; & I suspect that the last 20 pages have slightly flagged. Too many odds & ends to sweep up. But I have no idea of the whole—

A fine, blowing day. Starlings bathing. Must now write to Helen."
1934.10.02,"Yes, but my head will never let me glory sweepingly: always a tumble. Yesterday morning the old rays of light set in; & then the sharp, the very sharp pain over my eyes; so that I sat & lay about till tea; had no walk, had not a single idea of triumph or relief. L. bought me a little travelling ink pot, by way of congratulation. I wish I could think of a name. Sons & Daughters? Probably used already. Theres a mass to be done to the last chapter, which I shall, I hope, dv. as they say in some circles, I suppose still, begin tomorrow: while the putty is still soft.

So the summer is ended. Until the 9th of Sept: when Nessa came across the terrace—how I hear that cry Hes dead—a very vigorous, happy summer. Oh the joy of walking! I’ve never felt it so strong in me. Cowper Powys, oddly enough, expresses the same thing: the trance like, swimming, flying through the air; the current of sensations & ideas; & the slow, but fresh change of down, of road, of colour: all this churned up into a fine thin sheet of perfect calm happiness. Its true I often painted the brightest pictures on this sheet: & often talked aloud. Lord how many pages of Sons & Daughters—perhaps Daughters & Sons would give a rhythm more unlike Sons & Lovers, or Wives & Daughters [by Mrs Gaskell],—I made up, chattering them in my excitement on the top of the down, in the folds.

Too many buildings, alas: & gossip to the effect that Christie & the Ringmer building Co. are buying Botten’s Farm to build on. Sunday I was worried, walking to Lewes, by the cars & the villas. But again, I’ve discovered the ghostly farm walk; & the Piddinghoe walk; & such variety & loveliness—the river lead & silver: the ship—Servie of London—going down; the bridge opened. Mushrooms & the garden at night; the moon, like a dying dolphin’s eye; or red orange, the harvest moon; or polished like a steel knife; or lambent: sometimes rushing across the sky; sometimes hanging among the branches—Now in October the thick wet mist has come, thickening & blotting.

On Sunday we had Bunny & Julian; Bunny so thick & solid, like a beam out of an old tree; Julian rather smaller than usual. Bunny has grey wisps at his temples; talks like a heavy wardrobe; all heavy angular sentences. I noted how my own rushing pace, seemed too rushing, & after 10 minutes had adapted itself to Bunny.

How—do—you—start—an—aeroplane? This unheard cry [?], Lord what a wonder, filling sheets to an inch every Friday. Bunny has severe small blue eyes that slowly fix themselves. All rather heavy footed. Julian silent. So we walked on the Terrace. Then Duncan & Helen came—Helen in a long coat & the funny amateur hat with the green tuft that she wore at the service. It was rather fortunate that the first meeting should be among the flowers, vegetables, improvements. Then we went upstairs & talked & laughed about Roger, easily. I felt however the worn out, the used up feeling as if she were now— feeling the shallows, after the exaltation; the shingle grating, the sordid—poor Helen! All the [Fry] sisters conglomerate in B⁠[ernard]. St. & arrange R.’s pictures—dating them wrongly. How one can hear R. laugh! see him padding about in his slippers. Margery is left literary executor. Tatlock smelling of drink comes round & says he wants to write R.’s life. Well whats to be done about our ‘lives’ I wonder? The EMF. Goldie thing to me quite futile. But this is an aside. What we talked of was Ha & Joan & Pamela & Julian; & Helen made her usual quips & severities: but all was a little watery. Her blue & pink less bright—poor woman. She is very poor—it seems: must give up B. St. & find a flat: must perhaps give up Rodwell. Then the problem of the children—how facts come trooping in, when the great rush of emotion is past. I mean, this dealing with the difficulties used to be done so much by R.: at any rate, there he was, bullying her, laughing at her: forcing her to give it all up & come out to Venice, or St Remy. Now she’ll be more and more bothered, worried. But she has a great many friends.

And we went to Sissinghurst. Vita playing the Gramophone at the top of the pink tower. A blazing day. (I bought 1st edition of Mill on Floss at Websters by the way). Some constraint now, of a very simple & obvious kind, because of Gwen. She came in at 2. We were sitting under a pergola, lunching. An uneasy, nerve strained woman—very tense. She told us how she had taken Miss Maddock the 70 year old secretary to the Mayfair Hotel to tea. M. had eaten crumpets & cakes. Had had no lunch. Whats to become of her? Gwen rather a doer of good. This stimulates V.’s sentimental easy going benevolence, I think. And we talked of Sibyl & Ethel; & then went; V. saying, very calmly, that the majority agreed with me in thinking the D. Island a bad book. And I dont lose any of my liking for her gentleness, truthfulness, modesty. Ly S. has bought Long B. for £8,ooo.

1934.10.04,"A violent rain storm on the pond. The pond is covered with little white thorns; springing up & down: the pond is bristling with leaping white thorns: like the thorns on a small porcupine; bristles; then black waves: cross it: black shudders; & the little water thorns are white: a helter skelter rain, & the elms tossing it up & down: the pond overflowing on one side. Lily leaves tugging: the red flower swimming about; one leaf flapping. Then completely smooth for a moment. Then prickled: thorns like glass; but leaping up & down incessantly. A rapid smirch of shadow. Now light from the sun: green & red: shining: the pond a sage green: the grass brilliant green: red berries on the hedges: the cows very white: purple over Asheham."
1934.10.05,"The storm is over; having sunk a few ships. And half blown us along the towing path; & tossed all the apples off the trees. We are discussing plans for moving this lodge to the churchyard wall under the tree. Wicks’ estimate is for £157—which seems extreme, considering that its only a fad: will improve the view but then perhaps an improved view is worth 157. Water is also to be laid on: & I am in a mood rather to doubt my own earning capacity. That is to say the last chapter is going to give me a deal of trouble. But perhaps it is wrong to lay such stress on last chapters. They need not necessarily rise higher than the level of the book. My instinct is though that they shd. be more condensed: a summing up: a solution. If the last chapter fails does the book fail? What is the last chapter of War & Peace? I forget.

The names of the BBC committee are out: & I am interested to feel two different emotions: disappointment & relief; & a third, that it dont much matter either way."
1934.10.09,"Back again in London. A party last night: Mary Fisher, Eddie Playfair, Rose Macaulay & Saxon. An odd mixture; but successful. We cried with laughter. This was partly Eddie’s account of Carrie who went round the world with James: who died: & became ‘the body’. Mountains very nice. Everything very nice. This was to prove that character is one & indivisible. Rose maintained the opposite. “I’m a mere battlefield of opposite people—my ancestors” she said. “Take this as a simple illustration: I want to walk all day alone: but I also want to drive my car. We called it having “battling lizards”.” That made us laugh. Saxon & Eddie represented the uniformity of the Treasury. Also we discussed commas: Rose very erudite on that subject: & her book of extracts. How she grinds! And authors’ vanity; which was to be ravaged by fear of what one’s Aunt thinks of a review. She professed never to care, for herself, what reviewers said, & then began uneasily a story about the hostility of the Lit. Sup. to her last six novels; & how they had put her Milton into small type at the end. At which unconscious revelation we smiled. She is a ravaged sensitive old hack—as I should be, no doubt, save for L. Mary Fisher recalls Boo; but has a mean look a sharp practical look—derived from Lettice. She puts me out of conceit with the family face. Too insipid. The hair too mousy & untidy & the clothes dowdy. A drop of Fisher blood dilutes & acidifies. But she is upstanding; has lived in good company; is not a mere drudge; & adores her father, I guess; Likes authority; loves Winchester Oxford & the very urbane intellectual aristocracy; but I was not whizzed off my perch. The King of Jugoslavia & Bartou murdered this evening."
1934.10.10,"Today, as I have a few minutes left, I think I have improvised another method for P⁠[hases]. of F⁠[iction]. to be phases of the readers mind: different situations. Part 2. to be in dialogue, in a hotel on the Mediterranean: each chapter to correspond with the period. Thus to rob it of formality."
1934.10.11,"A brief note. In todays Lit. Sup. they advertise Men without Art by Wyndham Lewis. Chapters on Eliot, Faulkner, Hemingway, Virginia Woolf … Now I know by reason & instinct that this is an attack; that I am publicly demolished: nothing is left of me in Oxford & Cambridge & places where the young read Wyndham Lewis. My instinct is, not to read it. And for this reason: well, I open Keats: & find: “Praise or blame has 167 but a momentary effect on the man whose love of beauty in the abstract makes him a severe critic on his own works. My own domestic criticism has given me pain beyond what Blackwood or Quarterly could possibly inflict….. This is a mere matter of the moment—I think I shall be among the English poets after my death. Even as a matter of present interest the attempt to crush me in the Quarterly has only brought me more into notice.”

Well: do I think I shall be among the English novelists after my death? I hardly ever think about it. Why then do I shrink from reading W.L.? Why am I sensitive? I think vanity. I dislike the thought of being laughed at. of the glow of satisfaction that A B & C will get from hearing V.W. demolished: also it will strengthen further attacks. Perhaps I feel uncertain of my own gifts: but then, I know more about them than W.L.: & anyhow I intend to go on writing. What I shall do is craftily to gather the nature of the indictment from talk & reviews: &, in a year perhaps, when my book is out, I shall read it. Already I am feeling the calm that always comes to me with abuse: my back is against the wall: I am writing for the sake of writing: &c. & then there is the queer disreputable pleasure in being abused—in being a figure, in being a martyr. & so on."
1934.10.14,"The trouble is I have used every ounce of my creative writing mind in the Pargiters. No headache (save what Elly calls typical migraine—she came to see L. about his strain yesterday). I cannot puts spurs in my flanks. Its true I’ve planned the romantic chapter of notes: but I cant set to.

This morning I’ve taken the arrow of W⁠[yndham].L⁠[ewis]. to my heart: he makes tremendous & delightful fun of B. & B.: calls me a peeper, not a looker, a fundamental prude; but one of the 4 or 5 living (so it seems) who is an artist. Thats what I gather the flagellation amounts to: (Oh I’m underrated, Edith Sitwell says). Well: this gnat has settled & stung; & I think (12.30) the pain is oyer. Yes. I think its now rippling away. Only I cant write. When will my brain revive? in 10 days I think. And it can read admirably: I began [Thomson’s] The Seasons last night; after Eddie’s ridiculous rhodomontade—or so I judge it: like Madame Tussauds: a vast book called The Sun in Capricorn: a worthless book I think; so that my intention to make a beckon in his direction is now in abeyance. No. I don’t like him. Trash & tarnish; and this morbid silliness. Denzil Torrant. &c.

Well: I was going to say, I’m glad that I need not & cannot write, because the danger of being attacked is that it makes one answer back—a perfectly fatal thing to do. I mean, fatal, to arrange the P.s so as to meet his criticisms. And I think my revelation 2 years ago stands me in sublime stead, to adventure & discover, & allow no rigid poses: to be supple & naked to the truth. If there is truth in W.L. well, face it: I’ve no doubt I am prudish & peeping, well then live more boldly. But for God’s sake dont try to bend my writing one way or the other. Not that one can. And there is the odd pleasure too of being abused: & the feeling of being dismissed into obscurity is also pleasant & salutary."
1934.10.15,"Walked with L. all round Serpentine & K⁠[ensington]. Gardens yesterday (a fine blowy day: leaves falling) & asked him these questions:

1) What is the sensible attitude to criticism?

Not to read it.

2) What should I do now of a morning—creation flagging?

Read.

3) Does he feel I have prevented him from going abroad?

No. I have only prevented him from lesser activities (I think this was the answer).

We agreed to save up for foreign travel on a large scale to try to fly over America. Perhaps to go to India & China.

I now see us, far far away. A new civilisation &c.

I meant to read this morning, but got tempted into making notes for biography. Rather scrappy, but clearly the only complete escape from depression (W.L. & R⁠[oger]’s death) is in getting the mind to work. No anodyne possible I think in the morning. But I am as slack as a piece of maccaroni: & in this state cant shake off a blackness, a blankness. Now (10 to 1) after writing & beginning to read an old life of Boswell I feel the wheels grinding.

Ethel—oh d—n—after tea. Morgan tomorrow. Yes: creation drops the little personal body down: up we go: all that forgotten.

Oh & L. was divinely good: so direct: what an immense relief to talk to him! what a simplification. What an egress to open air & cold daylight: how dignified: yes, & I have him every day, as I so often think. So why—. &c. &c."
1934.10.16,"Quite cured today. So the W.L. illness lasted 2 days. Helped off by old Ethel’s bluff affection & stir yesterday, by buying a blouse; by falling fast asleep after dinner, when L. went to the Robsons.

Writing away this morning."
1934.10.17,"I am so sleepy. Is this age? I cant shake it off. And so gloomy. Thats the end of the book. I looked up past diaries—a reason for keeping them—& found the same misery after Waves. After Lighthouse I was I remember nearer suicide, seriously, than since 1913. It is after all natural. I’ve been galloping now for 3 months—so excited I made a plunge at my paper-well, cut that all off—after the first divine relief, of course some terrible blankness must spread. There’s nothing left of the people, of the ideas, of the strain, of the whole life in short that has been racing round my brain: not only the brain; it has seized hold of my leasure: think how I used to sit still on the same railway lines: running on my book. Well, so theres nothing to be done the next 2 or 3 or even 4 weeks but dandle oneself: refuse to face it: refuse to think about it. This time Roger makes it harder than usual. We had tea with Nessa yesterday. Yes, his death is worse than Lytton’s. Why I wonder? Such a blank wall. Such a silence. Such a poverty. How he reverberated! And I feel it through Nessa.

But selfishly, I cant throw it off as I did the first week after his death; when it became all the colours of the setting sun, in my excitement. Now theres the dulness, the cold to face & no protection. And so W.L. had the power to sting. No thats over. Only I cant get up any steam. I’m so ugly. So old. No one writes to me. I’m…. Well: dont think about it, & walk all over London; & see people. & imagine their lives. I cant read seriously. I feel so drowsy, as if my brain were dilated: cant contract: then I suddenly lapse into sleep.

Margery is going, Nessa thinks, to ask me to write about Roger. I dont feel ready to. I dread the plunge into the past. I slog away at Romance & biography of a morning.

I would like to write down more actual conversation; but its such hard work. With Nessa & Duncan at tea:

V. Roger.. well everybody he met felt like that about him. He got very restless in the last year or two. He was always jumping up to show one something. Clive made me very angry at Charleston—He abused Roger—really for the criticism in his article. He was jealous. Yes. I think it is right to have lives—What a pity that it should all be lost. Peoples impressions are good. Besides, someone will be certain to write about Roger—so it had better be by us.

Duncan. I liked Priestley’s play tho I’m told all his novels are very bad. He is very dramatic. He knows how—I mean—(D. always against public opinion—lying on the sofa—has had a cold).

Then Morgan, after tea, about the meeting of the Civil Liberties tomorrow.

M. I hadnt thought of that. I’m dreadfully ignorant. So Leonard you would say—may I have a piece of paper? Yes, then: the point is—I will say …"
1934.10.24,"I have just written with homage in my copy of Sickert. So thats’done.

And Stephen Spender, did I say, has defended me against W.L.; & Rosamond & Read & Stephen are coming tonight. And I have been toiling at an article on the Queen of Roumania: by way of a rest. No I cant write about Roger; & yesterday I went to see Lady Simon, in Catherine St. & looked at the conventional drawing room & tried to make out why it comes together. Two red & silver shields from Marshall & Snelgrove: a reproduction of an Italian picture; a comic parrot in watercolour; bad rugs; bears & lions; sham Adams mantelpiece; green, curtains; brown fumed oak stairs & carpet—all uneasy trifles, too many details: no design: no taste: only one thing after another.

Shena on couch like Tristram.

“I’ve been thinking—dont we lead a very narrow life at Manchester? We only see business men, university people, & social workers. Ought I to try & get artists to come?”

Rather worried & puzzled: reiterative; pale after an operation: is going to the Argentine. Tell me, how do writers see things? Are you interested in all kinds of people. So I made up a scene. Am I rather acting? inventing? Well I was tired after Pam⁠[Diamand]’s nondescript visit: she came—why? Oh yes, Hike the country. Very nice. Very nice house—& the children like it. And Micu is going to do papers for sweets. A thousand yards at a time. She is becoming the driven sweet wife; very nice; childlike: no go, or backbone: no look—of Roger: but affectionate. So I walked home from Shena across Westminster: a warm spring day: summer clothes: people strolling: streets crowded."
1934.10.26,"Yesterday at Ottoline’s. Old Yeats.

What he said was, he had been writing about me. The Waves. That comes after Stendhal he said. I see what you’re at—But I want more humanity. Cant bear Stendhal: observant [?]: photographic; has a passion for Balzac: reads & re-reads. Because his people are planted in history: there they are, sitting in the box at the opera: Tolstoy leaves them at school. I’m trying to get the Irish back to the great men of the 18th Century. Swift!

But did Swift like Ireland.

Read—(what? draper letter?) He started the whole Irish movement—made Irish different from English. Oh the bitterness against England.

Must get their back to their own speech.

You have always been rich & powerful. You create without hatred. The need of tragedy: some cause: that is what creates literature.

Rather vague about the Ethns. Takes 300 years to absorb a war. Not yet time to create after 1914. Must get dignity into letters.

Goldsmith’s English.

The Occult. That he believes in firmly. All his writing depends on it. Was walking with Robinson Ellis. The words came to him “The world is the excrement of God”: 2 minutes afterwards R.E. said them. This convinced Yeats of the existence of another mind. A woman accused him of being the father of her child. He went to Lady Jowett. She wrote a message in Greek—Oh sweet singer—showed it to Waley at Brit. Mus: said it was written by an Englishman⁠[?] 200 years ago. Anyhow this proves absolutely the existence of another mind. Neither religion nor science explains the world. The occult does explain it. All in Plotinus. Has seen things. His coat hanger advanced across the room one night. Then a coat on it, illuminated: then a hand in it. Is writing his memoirs. About Moore & Ly Gregory. Ave Vale all nonsense. At the age of 50 Moore found himself impotent. Hence his sex mania. ‘I dont know why he minded so much’. Scene with M.’s cook & the policeman. Is there no law to defend me from omelettes like that? This went on for 1½ hours, I should say. At last Ott brought up Pudley, & the session ended. I was too jaded after Rosamond Spender Read & Plomer & the incessant rather sniping talk about Grigson & Stephen’s muddled theories to whip my brain: but felt Yeats’ extreme directness, simplicity, & equality: liked his praise; liked him: but cant unriddle the universe at tea. He is older, less coloured & vigorous. Little burning eyes behind great glasses: ruffled hair: tweeds. Philip [Morrell] aged, whitened, fallen in: almost 70 I suppose. A new cumquhat dog: various obscure dowds: one Dilys Powell: & so on. Home to sleep over the fire: & now to Rodmell.

[Later] Yeats said that in writing his memoirs he had to leave out himself, because no man could tell the truth about the women in his life. Also no man knew about himself. Somebody had cast his horoscope & given him a character, the very opposite of his own conception; but as he now saw, this was his real character. He believes entirely in horoscopes. Will never do business with anyone without having their horoscope. Is trying to get a play acted in London, at the Gate. But no actor can produce a play. Actors only know their own parts. They cant see that theres a piebald horse outside the window.

Yeats always has ‘a narrative man’ with whom he goes for walks—a man who tells a story.

Yeats said of Proust “a slow motion novel”."
1934.10.29,"Reading Antigone. How powerful that spell is still—Greek. Thank heaven I learnt it young—an emotion different from any other. I will read Plotinus: Herodotus: Homer I think."
1934.10.31,"Too tired after dining with Helen last night & talking too much with Oliver about Roger & B⁠[loomsbur]⁠y—too tired to write. And must dine with Clive to meet Aldous & the Clarks. What a life I could have led if I had been born with full rich blood to my head. As it is, one late night floors me; all sand this morning. We talked too much, I think. And I sat in Roger’s chair, & thought once he was there—Oliver’s shoes like his. The room diminished slightly: not so rich & sonorous. Baba [Anrep] an ill favoured, rough mouthed girl. And Oliver’s mistress—dear me, why mistress? Sickert I rather gather a failure: silence descends on that little flurry.

Now to read Jane Austen’s Thomson’s Seasons.

Helen by the way asked me tentatively to write Roger’s Life. Julian to collect all facts, make a skeleton; I to sum & compose. But Margery [Fry] wants to write it. Margery has the documents: is executor. I deferred. Isnt a ‘Life’ impossible? Yes, said Oliver. All sorts of people shd put down recollections. And unprintable. So whats to come of it? I deferred, (what exactly does that word mean?)"
1934.11.01,"Ideas that came to me last night dining with Clive; talking to Aldous & the Kenneth Clarks.

About Roger’s life: that it should be written by different people to illustrate different stages.

Youth.

by Margery



Cambridge,

by Wedd?



Early London life …

Heard. & so on.



all to be combined say by Desmond & me together.

About novels: the different strata of being: the upper under—This is a familiar idea, partly tried in The Pargiters. But I think of working it out more closely; & now, particularly, in my critical book: showing how the mind naturally follows that order in thinking: how it is illustrated by literature.

I must now do biography & autobiography.

Talk at dinner about: Yeats; Noel Coward; the plates: Clarks cant use theirs: the hostesses: Sibyl & Emerald. Ly C⁠[unard]. says Aldous indecent: wears a false bust: their collection like playing cards; had dined & sat next Lady P. Smith; a bore; the other woman a hump back; Coward at Monte Carlo, laying his hand on A.’s arm: this this is divine—a Jazz like the rest. The variety of his gifts: but all out of the 6d box at Woolworth’s. Beating & beating & beating—an omelette without eggs, said A. Nothing there: but the heroic beating. Talk about the Occult: A. cant stand Auden. Nothing but a demagogue. Declaims: takes in the young. Something in Day Lewis—hasnt read Spender."
1934.11.02,"Two teeth out with a new anaesthetic: hence I write here, not seriously. And this is another pen. And my brain is very slightly frozen, like my gums. Teeth become like old roots that one breaks off. He broke, & I scarcely felt. My brain frozen thinks of Aldous & the Clarks; thinks vaguely of biography; thinks am I reviewed anywhere—cant look—thinks its a fine cold day. Angelica at the Nat. Gallery. Thinks how I shall read Dante; how I did not go to Vita’s lecture; how we have refused Enid Jones next week; how we should have met Wells there; I finished the Seasons last night: that is a surface reading, such as I give poetry for the first time. Ten skins to the mind. No, I cannot write at all with a frozen brain.

I went upstairs to rinse my bleeding gum—the cocaine lasts 1 an hour: then the nerves begin to feel again—& opened the Spectator & read W.L. on me again. An answer to Spender. “I am not malicious—several people call Mrs W. Felicia Hemans.” This I suppose is another little scratch of the cats claws: to slip that in, by the way—“I dont say it—others do”. And they are supercilious on the next page about Sickert; & so— Well L. says I shd. be contemptible to mind. Yes: but I do mind for 10 minutes: I mind being in the light again, just as I was sinking into my populous obscurity. I must take a pull on myself. I dont think this attack will last more than 2 days. I think I shall be free from the infection by Monday. But what a bore it all is. And how many sudden shoots into nothingness open before me. But wait one moment. At the worst, should I be a quite negligible writer, I enjoy writing: I think I am an honest observer. Therefore the world will go on providing me with excitement whether I can use it or not. Also, how am I to balance W.L.’s criticism with Yeats—let alone Goldie & Morgan? Would they have felt anything if I had been negligible? And about 2 in the morning I am possessed of a remarkable sense of driving ey⁠[e]⁠less strength. And I have L.: & there are his books; & our life together. And freedom, now, from money paring. And…. if only for a time I could completely forget my self, my reviews, my fame, my sink in the scale—which is bound to come now, & to last about 8 or 9 years—then I should be what I mostly am: very rapid, excited, amused: intense. Odd, these extravagant ups & downs of reputation: compare the American in the Mercury … no, for Gods sake dont compare: let all praise & blame sink to the bottom or float to the top & let me go my ways indifferent. And care for people. And let fly, in life, on all sides."
1934.11.12,"These are very sensible sayings I think. And its all forgotten & over—

What is uppermost now, is (1) The question of writing R.’s life. Helen came [on 8 November]. Says both she & M⁠[argery]. wish it. So I wait. What do I feel about it? If I could be free, then here’s the chance of trying biography: a splendid, difficult chance—better than trying to find a subject—that is, if I am free. But M. hesitates: I have heard nothing from her; & rather suspect she wants to do it herself.

We were at Monks House in a great flood of rain & storm of wind this week end; which lifted yesterday, & I took my Sunday morning walk with L. & saw the monkey that was found in the Brooks. This great yellow green ape had run all across the down from Peacehaven—a circus monkey wintering with a keeper up there. An odd sight to have met it clambering along over the downs. So I went on, to Piddinghoe, & back by the river. And my brain rose out of the mist (writing about reviewing, I mean) & I felt young & vigorous. Home with the car all acrid & yellow & red with chrysanthemums. And put them in water—a long job—& so to hear Sweeney Agonistes at the Group Theatre; an upper attic or studio: I sat by Tom: an audience, containing Ottoline & Hope & Raymond. The acting made more sense than the reading but I doubt that Tom has enough of a body & brain to bring off a whole play: certainly he conveys an emotion, an atmosphere: which is more than most: something peculiar to himself; sordid, emotional, intense—a kind of Crippen, in a mask: modernity & poetry locked together. I liked the egg speech. Talk with Hope about her thyroid gland & her dachshund: Hope as usual eccentric impulsive ecstatic odd. And there was a mint of notables."
1934.11.14,"Here I am taking a morning off to breathe in before I tackle the 9 volumes of that book. And I am dissipated & rather frittered. There is no doubt that to talk to Sibyl is very depressing. She mews & mows. Wont speak out; complains with one breath, asks pity but cant be induced to say what is on her mind. Perhaps there is very little there. She said ‘One is no longer so young as one was. Arthur is getting deaf. So I have to stand in a shop all day.. But one shouldn’t be—’ I think she called it ‘crimping’—I forget the exact word. Oblique references were made then to our quarrel. And I was hampered: couldnt get hold of her. Off she went, sentimentally mournful, apologetic. And she impeded Margery who came at the same moment—so that too remains, as they say, in abeyance. And this cringing makes my own soul flop."
1934.11.15,"And am now, 10.30 on Thursday morning, Nov. 15th, about to tackle re-reading & re-writing The Pargiters. An awful moment.

12.45. Well that horrid plunge has been made, & I’ve started rewriting the P.s. Lord Lord! 10 pages a day for 90 days: three months. The thing is to contract: each scene to be a scene, much dramatised; contrasted; each to be carefully dominated by one interest; some generalised. At any rate this releases the usual flood & proves that only creating can bring about proportion: now, damnably disagreeable, as I see it will be—compacting the vast mass—I am using my faculties again. & all the flies & fleas are forgotten."
1934.11.17,"A note: despair at the badness of the book: cant think how I ever could write such stuff—& with such excitement: thats yesterday: today I think it good again. A note, by way of advising other Virginias with other books that this is the way of the thing: up down, up down—& Lord knows the truth."
1934.11.21,"Margery Fry to tea on Sunday. A long debate about the book on Roger: not very conclusive. She says she wants a study by me, reinforced with chapters on other aspects. I say, well but those books are unreadable. Oh of course I want you to be quite free she says. I should have to say something about his life, I say. The family—Now there of course I’m afraid I should have to ask you to be careful, she says. Agnes is stone deaf; has lived all her life in the family. I couldn’t let her be hurt—And so on. The upshot of all of which is that she’s to write to the NS. asking for letters: that I’m to go through them; that we’re then to discuss—so it will drag on these many months, I suppose. And I plan working at P.s: & getting in reading time with Roger’s papers, so that by October next I could write, if thats the decision. But what?

A fog lasting several days. Both of us rather cheerful again. L. has finished the first part of Quack: & it goes along vigorously. And we’ve seen—Lady Rhondda, Heard, Eth Williamson, Julian; Lyn; Tom; Kitchin; Hope …. in fact we’ve done our duty as party givers, & today heave a sigh of heavenly gladness because Raymond has a cold & puts our dinner with him off. I am reading, with interest & distaste, Wells; I want to read a great deal; & the P.s goes at 8 or 9 pages daily. & that is why I feel content.

Tom’s head is very remarkable; such a conflict; so many forces have smashed against him: the wild eye still; but all rocky, yellow, riven, & constricted. Sits very solid—large shoulders—in his chair, & talks easily but with authority. Is a great man, in a way, now: self confident, didactic; But to me, still, a dear old ass; I mean I cant be frozen off with this divine authority any longer. Not a very good evening. Talk scattered & surface pattering. Hope & her dog distracting. Kitchin a little fat & white & cunning & not up to the mark. A rather conceited touchy man, I guess; has a good opinion of himself; & is slightly commonplace. But how little I care now, for these slight misfits. Generally there’s some fun to be had—a saying, an attitude. Tom is larger minded than of old; “But thats only human” he said, when I asked him if he still liked seeing his own name in print."
1934.11.26,"At Rodmell for the week end. My Lodge is demolished; the new house in process of building in the orchard. There will be open doors in front; & a view right over to Caburn. I think I shall sleep there on summer nights. I, made out a careful map of the week; & then, of course, come home & find us asked by the Kauffers to a show of Man Ray’s photographs in Bedford Sq. So we go, & find Aldous, Mary & Jack, & a South American Vasta—was that what Roger called these opulent millionaires from Buenos Aires? Anyhow she was very ripe & rich; with pearls at her ears, as if a large moth had laid clusters of eggs; the colour of an apricot under glass; eyes I think brightened by some cosmetic; but there we stood & talked, in French, & English, about the Estancia, the great white rooms, the cactuses, the gardenias, the wealth & opulence of South America; so to Rome & Mussolini, whom she’s just seen. He was simple & kind—on purpose. She sat & forgot to call him Excellency. And he said sometimes he woke in the night & wondered Are my people happy? She said he is the Coué of Italy: repeats every day & every way &c. Also spoke of women: how no great man—Bismarck, Napoleon, Caesar, needed them: how Beatrice was only Florence. And how we all make mistakes: hers had been that she made an unhappy marriage. “But now go & have a child” he told her. The time is past she said. And so to Me de Noailles, dying of extinguished vanity in a small flat. She lay in bed, bedizened, covered with dozens & dozens of veils &c: began plucking them off; was never still a moment, lighting lamps & putting them out; demanded worship; was not old, but had outlived her fame. Nothing wrong with her but the death of her great fame. And she left letters to Barrés wh. his widow holds; & her doctor is piecing the story together. Then of a sudden we part; Man Ray says will I come & be photographed—on Tuesday 3.30. Mary says she wants to come to tea. Thats the end of my planned week—almost."
1934.11.27,"Human misery is certainly very great. We wish to comfort Nessa; have her to dinner; & tell her about Julian’s poems. At once she ruffles like a formidable hen. I am irritated. This is the religion & superstition of motherhood. Well—L. then speaks, emphatically but reasonably. She is also reasonable but cold. All our feelings are confused: mine discreditable. Why does it irritate me so, this maternal partiality? Anyhow, we all sit exacerbating ourselves, instead of consoling. And she is like a stone wall when I hint that Julian might mend his manners—at least be more considerate—perhaps conciliate Lady R⁠[hondda], “Like Eddie Playfair—she said at once. No, thats not Julian’s way.” And “I should have thought that anyone of sense could have seen—Mrs Grant [Duncan’s mother] thought him charming” .. &c &c. Then why does J. beg us to get him a job? No, it was not a nice evening; & she is lonely without Roger. And the S. American Okampo sent me orchids. I dislike many of my feelings. Most of all I hate the hush & mystery of motherhood. How unreal it all is!"
1934.12.02,"Isnt it odd? Some days I cant read Dante at all after revising the P.s: other days I find it very sublime & helpful. Raises one out of the chatter of words. But today (doing the scene at the Lodge) I’m too excited, I think it a good book today. I’m in the thick again. But I will stop at the end of the funeral scene, & calm my brain. That is I will write the play for Xmas: Freshwater a farce—for a joke. And rig up my Contemporary Criticism article: & look around. David Cecil on fiction: a good book for readers, not for writers—all so elementary: but some good points made, from the outside. I’ve done though with that sort of criticism. And he’s often wrong: gets W.H. wrong, I think: wants to have a profound theory. We—B⁠[loomsbur]⁠y—are dead; so says Joad. I snap my fingers at him. Lytton & I the two destructors.

Poor Francis lies in a hotel bedroom in Russell Sqre this rainy morning. I went in & sat with him. Quite himself with a lump on his forehead. And is aware of it all. May die under another operation, or slowly stiffen into complete paralysis. His brain may go. All this he knows; & there it was between us, as we joked. He came to the verge of it once or twice. But I cant feel any more at the moment—not after Roger. I cannot go through that again. Thats my feeling. I kissed him. “This is the first time—this chaste kiss” he said. So I kissed him again. But I must not cry, I thought, & so went. And he said, bitterly, how he had given 10 years of his life to love—to a horrid little creature. Thank God I never let you see him, he said. Gone to Russia. No I really couldnt follow him there. When I saw him first—I just came into the room—I thought I had never seen anyone so beautiful. He had talent of course. But….—So we rambled & rattled. And Hubert Waley, dark & slim, poured him out whiskey, as if they now let him have what he likes. He cant read. He lies there with one arm bandaged: in that bedroom, with the chrysanthemums, under a green silk quilt.

Today come Okampo & H—no I cant remember the name of the French journalist deposited on me by Peter [Lucas]. Oh damn ones friends!"
1934.12.18,"Talk with Francis yesterday. He is dying: but makes no bones about it: only his expression is quite different. Has no hope. The man says he asks every evening how long will this go on, & hopes for the end. He was exactly as usual; no wandering, no incoherence. A credit to atheism. The soul deserves to be immortal, as L. said. We walked back, glad to be alive: numb somehow. I cant use my imagination on that theme. What wd it be like to lie there, expecting death? & how odd & strange a death. I write hurriedly, going to Angelica’s [school] concert this fine soft day."
1934.12.30,"Since I forgot to bring my writing book, I must fill up here, on loose sheets. End the year; with those cursed dogs barking: & I am sitting in my new house; & it is, of all hours, 3.10; & it is raining; & the Cow [Mabel] has the sciatica; & we are taking her into Lewes to catch a train to London; after which we have tea at Charleston, act the play [i.e.: rehearse Freshwater] & dine there. It has been the wettest Christmas, I should say, drawing a bow at a venture, on record. Only yesterday did I manage my phantom farm walk; but pray God, with Christmas over, the rain will stop falling, Miss Emery’s dogs barking.

It was stupid to come without a book, seeing that I end every morning with a head full of ideas about The Pargiters. It is very interesting to write out. I am re-writing considerably. My idea is to space contrast the scenes; very intense, less so: then drama; then narrative. Keeping a kind of swing & rhythm through them all. Anyhow it admits of great variety—this book.

I think it shall be called Ordinary People. I finished, more or less, Maggie & Sarah, the first scene, in the bedroom: with what excitement I wrote it! And now hardly a line of the original is left. Yes but the spirit is caught I think. I write perhaps 60 pages before I catch that. And coming back I see it hopping like a yellow canary on its perch. I want to make both S. & M. bold characters, using character dialogue. Then we go on to Martin’s visit to Eleanor: then the long day that ends with the King’s death. I have sweated off 80 or 90 pages, mostly due to a fault in paging though.

End of the year: & Francis transacting his death at that nursing home in Collingham Place. The expression on his face is what I see: as if he were facing a peculiar lonely sorrow. One’s own death—think of lying there alone, looking at it, at 45 or so: with a great desire to live. “And so the New Statesman’s going to be the best paper that ever was, is it?” He’s dead though (of Brimley Johnson) spoken with a kind of bitterness. None of these words are exactly right.

And here we are, chafed by the Cow’s lame leg & the dogs: yet as usual very happy I think: ever so full of ideas. L. finishing his Quack Quack of a morning: the Zet [Mitz] crawling from one chair to the other—picking at L.’s head.

And Roger dead. And am I to write about him? And the stirring of the embers—I mean the wish to make up as much of a fire as possible. So to get ready for the wet drive—dogs still barking."
1935.01.01,"We went to Charleston. Nessa explained to us that Clive had made a scene the night before about bringing six friends to the party. Wouldnt come, unless he could bring 6 friends without naming them. Now why? I suppose something rankling about our not liking Raymond & so on. Final grumbles to be heard at dinner; as if he were anxious to explain. The play rather tosh; but I’m not going to bother about making a good impression as a play wright. And I had a lovely old years walk yesterday round the rat farm valley, by a new way, & met Mr Freeth, & talked about road making; & then in to Lewes to take the car to Martins [garage], & then home, & read St Paul & the papers. I must buy the Old Testament. I am reading the Acts of the Apostles. At last I am illuminating that dark spot in my reading. What happened in Rome? And there are seven volumes of Renan. Lytton calls him ‘mellifluous’. Yeats & Aldous agreed, the other day, that their great aim in writing is to avoid the ‘literary’. Aldous said how extraordinary the ‘literary’ fetish had been among the Victorians. Yeats said that he wanted only to use the words that real people say. That his change had come through writing plays. And I said, rashly, that all the same his meaning was very difficult. And what is ‘the literary’? Thats rather an interesting question. Might go into that, if I ever write my critical book. But now I want to write On being despised. My mind will go on pumping up ideas for that. And I must finish Ordinary People: & then there’s Roger. If I could finish O.P. in July: I would spend August in reading Roger, & writing Despised. Begin Roger in October 1935. Is that possible? Publish O.P. in Oct: & work at those two during 1936. Lord knows! But I must press a good deal of work in—remembering 53—54—55 are on me. And how excited I get over my ideas! And there’s people to see—"
1935.01.06,"Francis died on 2nd. It was a mercy, as we say, that it ended so soon. But a queer thing death. Last night I suddenly thought, how silly & indeed disgusting death, the decomposition of the body, &c. Why think of it as anything noble?

We lunched with Maynard & Lydia. The first fine cold day since we came. Talk rather sterile at first. Servant in the room. I suddenly scaled Lydia’s depths; & desire to have it recognised. We were talking about Somerset Maugham. She “I said to him, do you write in the morning or the evening? And he said “This is not the time to discuss things like that” he thought me so naiv: he thought I was nothing more.” “But when I write your life I will bring in the other Lydia” I said. Oh Virginia do! she exclaimed. M⁠[aynard]. talked about the books he bought at the Gibbon sale. Geoffrey bought an Herodotus full of G.’s notes. Geoffrey’s library is the best investment he ever made. After lunch we got through the formal artificial. We talked about Francis: M. said he was a case of arrested development; had been a most brilliant undergraduate, & remained one. Should have his brain analysed. Then Wells—had read his Au⁠[tobiograph]⁠y. Thought him a little squit. Ah Maynard, you could not put that word in print. A lack of decency, said M. Shaw feels it. Shaw wd. never write of anyone he respected as he wrote of Wells. Then he read us a long magnificently spry & juicy letter from Shaw, on a sickbed, aged 77. The whole of economics twiddled round on his finger, with the usual dives & gibes & colloquialities. The most artificial of all styles, I said, like his seeming natural speaking. M.[’s] own letter said that he thinks he has revolutionised economics; in the new book he is writing. “Wait ten years, & let it absorb the politics & the psychology & so on that will accrue to it; & then you’ll see—the old Ricardo system will be exposed; & the whole thing set on a new footing.” This he wrote in so many words: a gigantic boast; true I daresay. That was why we were asked to lunch not tea—that he may write his book in the soft exciting hours. “He pots” said Lydia when we got up to go. He was potting this morning. “All the weeklies are mere homes for inferiority complexes” he said. Nobody has any dignity or nobility as a critic. Except Chesterton, struck in Lydia. What we want is impersonality, I said. And we discussed Joad’s dismissal of Bloomsbury. So to our car, they hanging arm in arm. And to Lewes to get the gaiters I’m so proud of. And a teasing letter (the other night) from E⁠[lizabe]⁠th Bibesco.

“I am afraid that it had not occurred to me that in matters of ultimate importance even feminists cd. wish to segregate & label the sexes. It wd. seem to be a pity that sex alone should be able to bring them together”—

to which I replied, What about Hitler? This is because, when she asked me to join the Cttee of the anti-Fascist Exn., I asked why the woman question was ignored. So we go on, sparring & biting. I shouldn’t mind giving that woman a toss in the air [word illegible]"
1935.01.11,"I have made a very clever arrangement on the new board that L. gave me for Christmas: ink, pen tray &c I never cease to get pleasure from these clever arrangements. So death will be very dull. There are no letters in the grave, as Dr Johnson said. A very long, rather formal, I mean affected letter from Tom this morning, which I must put away, as it will be so valuable. Did he think that when he was writing it? L. whose modesty is enough to make me blush, heard from Brace yesterday that they anticipate a large sale for Quack Quack. Some ass wants him to call it—some asses’ name. It will be out this spring. This spring will be on us all of a clap. Very windy; today: a damp misted walk two days ago to Piddinghoe. Now the trees are threshing. Nessa & Angelica & Eve yesterday. We talk a great deal about the play. An amusing incident. And I shall hire a donkeys head to take my call in—by way of saying This is a donkeys work. I make out that I shall reduce The Caravan (so called suddenly) to 150,000: & shall finish retyping in May. I wonder. It is compressed I think. And sometimes my brain threatens to split with all the meaning I think I could press into it. The discovery of this book, it dawns upon me, is the combination of the external & the internal. I am using both, freely. And my eye has gathered in a good many externals in its time. See how much more I write about myself than Leonard does about himself. Already engagements are piling; & the lap ahead will be full of the usual jerks & strains. I am going to a Comttee I think at the Oxfords on Wednesday: Tom suggests a fortnightly tea. And there’s Helen … I never never invite anyone; but lie like an apron under an apple tree for fruit to drop.

I cant read Dante of a morning after the struggle with fiction. I wish I could find some way of composing my mind—its absurd to let it be ravaged by scenes; when I may not have read all Dante before I—but why harp on death? On the contrary, it is better to pull on my galoshes & go through the gale to lunch off scrambled egg & sausages. Louie & L. will eat liver. Lambs liver is more tender than calfs, said Louie, thus filling up a blank in my knowledge of the world.

[Diary XXIV]"
1935.01.19,"The play came off last night, with the result that I am dry-brained this morning, & can only use this book as a pillow. It was said, inevitably, to be a great success; & I enjoyed—let me see what? Bunny’s praise; Oliver’s; but not much Christabel’s, or the standing about pumping up vivacities with David [Cecil], Cory [Bell], Elizabeth Bowen: yet on the whole, it is good to have an unbuttoned laughing evening once in a way. Angelica ravishing of course, but of course too grown up for my taste. That is, I rather dread Bloomsbury; & rather relish the clumsy directness, the hard fact of the Stephen girls: so clumsy & large. But they will become workers—in the cause of—how the phrases one has written & listened to so many times run in the head! And Bobo [Mayor] by the way, greyhaired, silver & rose, very handsome, exacerbated me by saying I was always publishing. Am I? But I carefully extracted that thorn & put it on the mantelpiece. And Morgan said it was lovely, I mean the play. In the middle, old Gumbo [Marjorie Strachey] delivered a stout envelope, with a photograph of her mother. Old: Gumbo never went to America after all. And Rosamond’s play is dubious, because Gielgud has made such a success with Hamlet. There is something pleasing in the misfortunes of ones friends: I wonder.

And there was Helen, & she said that Margery has all her spines erect again, about Roger: which makes me guess that she is doubtful about that biography. Roger’s ghost knocked at the door—his portrait of Charlie Sanger was delivered in the thick of the rehearsal. And How Francis would have enjoyed this, Leonard said. These are our ghosts now. But they would applaud the attempt. So to sleep: & now, God bless my soul, as Tenn: would say [see Freshwater], I must rinse & freshen my mind, & make it work soberly on something hard: theres my Dante; & Renan. And the horrid winter lap begins; the pale unbecoming days, like an aging woman seen at 10 o’clock. However, L. & I shall go for a walk this afternoon; & that seems to me an enormous balance at the Bank: solid happiness.

I have an idea for a ‘play’ Summers night. Someone on a seat. And voices speaking from the flowers."
1935.01.23,"Yes, I ought to have explained why I wrote the Sickert. I always think of things too late. I am reading the Faery Queen—with delight. I shall write about it. I took Angelica shopping. “Do you mind if I read the Heir of Redcliffe?” she said at tea, amusing me. What a curious sense the clothes sense is! Buying her coat, mine, hearing the women talk, as of race horses, about new skirts. And I am fluttered because I must lunch with Clive tomorrow in my new coat. And I cant think out what I mean about conception: the idea behind F.Q. How to express a kind of natural transition from state to state. And the air of natural beauty. It is better to read the originals. Well, Clive’s lunch will jump me out of this. And now that the play is over, we must begin to see people here: & go to Hamlet, & plan our spring journey. I am taking a fortnight off fiction. My mind became knotted. I think of making Theresa sing: & so lyricise the argument. Get as far from T (so called after my Sarah & Elvira provisionally). But oh heavens the duck squashy—this is from the pressed duck Jack [Hills] once gave us. All juice: one squab of juice. I am reading Point Counterpoint. Not a good novel, all raw, uncooked, protesting. A descendant, oddly enough, of Mrs H. Ward: interest in ideas; makes people into ideas.

A man from America returns my letters & says he is glad to see me as I am."
1935.02.01,"And again this morning, Friday, I’m too tired to go on with P.s. Why? Talking too much I daresay. I thought though I wanted ‘society’: & saw Helen, Mary, Gillet. Ann tonight. I think the P.s however a promising work. Only nerve vigour wanted. A day off today."
1935.02.02,"Poor old Ethel has been rooked £1600 by the Treasury on unpaid income tax. She says she wont accept a penny & will pay it out of her income, but she may have to sell Coign. This at 76—

Ann to dinner last night: rather pale, rather resolute & melancholy perhaps. Talked of servants & science. She is going in for another Exn [?] at Newnham, & I had to vouch for her character to the Mistress of Girton. Rather a queer comment upon the independence of family control. Hadnt even told her parents about these formalities. Karin only seen in bed of a morning, Adrian seldom, the house full of lodgers & patients, Ann found going off alone to get a meal. An attractive girl; but uncombed; independent, proud of Stephen blood; much brought up by school mistresses; contemptuous of exams; wishes to be a doctor, & live in Geneva. Judith a great admirer of Hazlitt, & writes essays in secret.

Headachy all day. Walked to Chancery Lane in bitter rain about my spectacles, & am going to experiment with an improved version of a lorgnette. I wrote in praise of Rebecca’s book to Rebecca, & have had no answer. This I did because of the talk at Charleston, when they said how much pleasure such letters gave. I expect I have (somehow) given pain. But its no great matter. My conscience, as they say, is clear. And now I must write to Eth Williamson, about Ethel."
1935.02.03,"Notes:

Mrs W. saying she had been “happy” suddenly the night before. And once walking up Regent Street. What a divine feeling. And then it went. She did not know what caused it, or how to describe it

(2) The man in charge of the cactuses at Kew. The unreality: himself [?] become a living cactus, perhaps: or a hater of cactuses. Their involved serpentings: their grotesqueness. As a matter of fact he was a withered & bloodless old man. Gone grey, infinitely bored, by living with cactuses.

Tuesday 5 February

Why should I mind so much Rebecca not answering my letter? Vanity largely, I suppose. I thought she would be glad &c. Never mind. She is a queer ill bred mind, with all the qualities I lack & fear.

Tom to tea, yesterday. An admirable way of seeing him. And how he suffers! Yes: I felt my accursed gift of sympathy rising. He seemed to have got so little joy or satisfaction out of being Tom. We—L. rather—argued, about the T & T correspondence. Highly philosophical: on war: suddenly T. spoke with a genuine cry of feeling. About immortality: what it meant to him—I think it was that: anyhow he revealed his passion, as he seldom does. A religious soul: an unhappy man: a lonely very sensitive man, all wrapt up in fibres of self torture, doubt, conceit, desire for warmth & intimacy. And I’m very fond of him—like him in some of my reserves & subterfuges. Tonight Raymond & Joyce W.: and I dont look forward to it, my spirits damped by Rebecca. A vast sorrow at the back of life this winter. And then my blood rises & I create—yesterday walking by the lake in Regents Park, going to Hugo’s. And I finished the difficult song chapter this morning.

After abusing booksellers yesterday for some time, I said to Tom, do you ever buy a new book? Never he said. And I said, I sometimes buy poetry, thats all. So this accounts for the problem, it strikes me, why authors dont sell: why booksellers dont stock &c &c."
1935.02.06,"I open this book to record the fact, with all its psychological implications;—the fact that Rebecca’s snub has now worn off. It lasted about 4 days: gave me a cold goose feather feeling every morning & every evening. It will now gradually fade out; & I shall dismiss her, & all that is implicit in that situation. But I should still be very glad if she did write to me. On the other hand, the feeling of independence is even better than the feeling of pleasure would be.

A story Joyce Wethered told: there is a woman who was jilted by a man for a shop girl. She now spends her life going to shops & making the shop girls cry. She is a well known figure, & always does this. The girls at Fortnums are always crying: so are the men, but not so often. They cry because the head of the department says something that hurts their feelings. They are very badly paid—girls £2 a week—men 3 or 4—& it leads to nothing. But they are always anxious to come."
1935.02.08,"Wright to lunch yesterday: Miss Delafield passes me in the square: the Holtby type; dine with Nessa; & oh dear, how the ghost of Roger haunted us! What a dumb misery life is for her: [Kenneth] Clark had been in; hadnt seen anything of what Roger would have seen. An extraordinary sense of him: of wishing for him; of vacancy. A letter from Margery, who is bringing documents, & wants to see me next week. Excited about Ordinary]. P⁠[eople]. & no letter from Rebecca. My desk a failure."
1935.02.12,"This should be the coldest day in the year, according to averages; & it was a bitter week end [at Rodmell] & L. had a cold & I had the divine good sense to suggest staying till Monday; & Monday, when we drove up at midday was the first day of spring. We lunched at Reigate & the marmoset attracted great attention; the well of nice middle class women is bottomless; & the two men, who were talking about the mystery of razors, “I had a clean shave on Saturday … but this morning with the same razor…” & then about the County Court, poison, & the legal status of Kingswood [Surrey], being I suppose small solicitors, said Might I ask you, Sir, what that animal is? Then we came home; then Robson came to tea, & let out a number of highly sensible remarks about the rents of houses. He has—incredible though it may seem—actually, in 3 minutes, taken a perfect house in Westbourne Terrace, at an absurdly low rent, & the house, being faced with stone, not stucco, will be very cheap to repair: also the landlord is responsible for structural repairs: Willie is expecting “an addition to the family shortly”. A marvellous feat: one supposes his gestation must be as long as an elephants. He retired to L.’s room. Colefax then came half an hour late: & we had it out. Lord what a drubbing you gave me in the summer, I managed to thrust in, after the usual patter about dining last night with somebody who had been dining with Ll. George. Then her defences crumpled: she flushed & quickened; so did I. She sat on the floor by the way, & pulled down some white undergarment which had become creased. She only wears one under garment & a small belt, by the way. And she twittered out how what had hurt her had been my thinking, or insinuating, that her dinner was merely a snob dinner to bring celebrities together. The truth was Noel [Coward] adores me; & I could save him from being as clever as a bag of ferrets & as trivial as a perch of canaries. And of course, I rather liked her. And she is so childishly ready to patter about her own simple love of sunsets, comparing herself to the worldly—for example Christabel & Lady Cholmondeley. That I stubbed by saying I admired & loved those who fill their sails with the spice breezes of the great world. So she had to trim & hedge; & admit that parties are a stimulus to the imagination; & that her chief pleasure is to tell herself stories, to make up a life, a picture, as she bustles & flits. This I think was intended to be in my manner—a tribute to the imaginative, artistic life: for indeed what she cant bear is to be rated a hard society woman: as she is, partly; but then we’re all curates eggs, as I was feeling: a mix: when L. came in & the political situation, was again to the fore. “I was in Manchester last week … a cotton manufacturer told me that now Mosley has no chance in the North.. He has, I know for a fact, to shut down several branches. And he’s very hard up.” So she went & we kissed in the hall.

This morning Mabel’s brother in law, Mr Shine, said, about my studio windows, “Theres the force, the push, & the fit—to use engineering terms.” This was to show us his intellectual eminence—a nice honest eyed false toothed man, who shines in the Labour world, & cant get a job. So I will keep this phrase for Mr Duffus."
1935.02.20,"A row with Clive which spoilt my dinner at the Reads. Lor! the misery of human life—our capacity for making ourselves miserable & stinging & biting like so many fleas. Not a very serious fleabite this one; only rouses my old inflammation—I mean, after all those other little pismire affairs, I always get the sense of those unhappy days. He wrote one of his absurd pompous letters to Lord Ivor, as chairman of the F. Cttee: & quoted Virginia Woolf inviting me to “strike a blow for freedom”. And so Wright rang up & Mr Blunt came round, & I had to explain, & then to write a letter, which brings the blood to my head, & takes time; & sent me parched & throbbing up to that vast comfortless studio, where none of the charm of Bohemia mitigated the hard chairs, the skimpy wine, & the very nice sensible conversation. Henry Moore, sculptor & his Russian wife, something like Cordelia Fisher in the old days to look at; but more sympathetic. Respectable B⁠[ohemi]⁠a is a little cheerless. Better have Sybil or the real thing. But all went decorously. Steel chairs, clear pale colours; talk of pots; brainy talk, specialists talk. Read devitalised: possibly his look—a shop assistant. So this morning I cant write; only correct; & Hugh [Walpole] & Elth Bowen tonight, & tea with Nessa & Ethel Walker. Never mind.

Sara is the real difficulty: I cant get her into the main stream, yet she is essential. A very difficult problem; this transition business. And the burden of something that I wont call propaganda. I have a horror of the Aldous novel: that must be avoided. But ideas are sticky things: wont coalesce; hold up the creative, subconscious faculty: thats it I suppose. Ive written the chop house scene I dont know how many times."
1935.02.21,"A good party last night with old Hugh. Hugh on Hollywood. What was interesting though & rather horrifying was his account of his own pain: an agony of pain in his arm, like broken bones twittering incessantly. Agony agony agony—hadnt realised there could be such pain. Once he burst into tears & sat up shouting. Was conveyed across America in an aeroplane. Saw ‘the sky’. And then, just as the pain was coming on at Hampstead, at Harold’s house, a parcel was delivered: a bottle of a quack medicine called Cleano. And he took a dose, & slept; & next day, he was better. And has had no pain since. But what was shocking was to see him an old man. All the buoyancy & taut pink skin gone. Yet difficult to say why one feels this. Something sunk & shuttered in him. Cavities in some lights. I liked him. And I liked his capacity for miraculous rebirth. Six months at Hollywood has completely changed him. When we said something about upper class, he laughed. Classes have been wiped out. He has seen through everything. Given up the Book of the Month; no longer frets about fame & reviews; & is taking to the great new art—the complex & amazing art of colour, music, words all in one. Of course there may be something in it. Mary came; Eth Bowen, & Julian, who as usual annoyed me by denouncing my “brutality”. What an uncomfortable relation, Aunt & nephew. And how nice he is, & how obtuse. But it was a flourishing kind of evening: better I think than the Reads. I rather mean to write to Hugh.

Tea with Nessa & old bass voiced Ethel Walker in her serge suit & red tie. We are to go to a dinner given to her. She told some instalments of her life’s history: some repetitions. Was the daughter of a hard bullying clever man. Damn you, you little brute, he said to her. And the cab horse ran away & climbed a six foot wall, while she clasped her mother, a very stout woman, & said “Screaming makes it worse”.

A letter of explanation & conciliation from Clive. No satire intended. So be it."
1935.02.26,"A very fine skyblue day, my windows completely filled with blue for a wonder. Mr Riley has just mended them. And I have been writing & writing & re-writing the scene by the Round Pond. What I want to do is to reduce it all so that each sentence though perfectly natural dialogue has a great pressure of meaning behind it. And the most careful harmony & contrast of scene—the boats colliding &c—has also to be arranged. Hence the extreme difficulty. But I hope perhaps tomorrow to have done, & then the dinner party & Kitty in the country should go quicker. At least I find the upper air scenes much simpler: & I think its right to keep them so. But Lord what a lot of work still to do! It wont be done before August. And here I am plagued by the sudden wish to write an Anti fascist Pamphlet. L. & I, after snarling over my cigarette smoking last night (I’m refraining altogether & without difficulty today) had a long discussion, about all the things I might put in my pamphlet. He was extremely reasonable & adorable, & told me I should have to take account of the economic question. His specialised knowledge is of course an immense gain, if I could use it & stand away: I mean in all writing, its the person’s own edge that counts. Cory [Bell] to tea."
1935.02.27,"And I’ve just written it all over again. But it must do this time, I say to myself. Yet I know that I must put the screw on & write some pages again. Its too jerky: too [blank in mss] Its obvious that one person sees one thing & another another: & that one has to draw them together Who was it who said, through the unconscious one comes to the conscious, & then again to the unconscious? I rather think it was Miss West about childrens drawings last night at tea. I rather suspect she wanted to be an artist. Anyhow she knew McKnight Kauffer when he was married, & told us a very discreditable story about him. Hence I suspect his extreme fawning & flattery when we meet, & my vague discomfort. A pouring wet day, after yesterdays sun; & our balmy walk across the Park to Harrods: & nobody has written to me, & I’m neglected, & I’m as safe as a sandboy; as a toad in an oak tree; & my window wont shut. Hence the draught.

I now feel a strong desire to stop reading F⁠[aery]⁠Q⁠[ueen]: to read Cicero’s letters, & the Chateaubriand Memoirs. As far as I can see, this is the natural swing of the pendulum. To particularise, after the generalisation of Romantic poetry."
1935.03.01,"First of March: first of spring. Another blue day; & we’re off to Walton on Thames, so I must cut short my Dante—dear me. Last nights party—Ann [Stephen] & Richard Ll. D.—that was to have been so dashing & easy, turned out rather a grind. Ann, poor dear, in her thick shoes:—hadn’t troubled to change them, or to brush her hair, mumbled, & was shy (as I used to be, I suppose, at 19). Richard, who has never been to a public school, & therefore has no inversions & perversions, ran free as a line with a salmon on it. But, then in came Janet (the image of Madge) & a great fat shiny nosed blubber lipped man, her husband: & Saxon, shrivelled & salted. No: not an easy party. How parties differ! L. & I did our old owls with a vengeance. But we were all at the wrong angles: cousins, old friends, new;—no, it was not an easy evening. Janet told the story of her dismissal, because the Beit fellowship (?) decided that no woman can do research work. This led to a fruitful discussion—fruitful for my book I mean—of the jealousy of the medical male: vested interests; how its partly that they dislike competition; partly that they cling to the status quo. But I must go & lunch at 12.30 for our expedition."
1935.03.04,"It was a charming grey distinguished expedition too: to Walton; & we walked by the river, & said it was like a French picture. The grey trees, the weir churning, the bridge, the white cupola, & a lion in marble. L. finished Quack Quack the day before.

Yesterday I did not enjoy. What a guzzler old Ethel has become. She guzzled our very tough jobs [?chops], till I could not sit still. She is a greedy old woman; I dont like greed when it comes to champing & chawing & sweeping up gravy. And she gets red, drinking. Then the concert. How long how little music in it that I enjoyed! Beecham’s face beaming, ecstatic, like a yellow copper idol: such grimaces, attenuations, dancings, swingings: his collar crumpled. Old Hugh [Walpole] in the stalls. I went down, & saw him, tragic, sitting alone like an old man. What is there tragic now in his expression? Some loneliness, & pain. He did not know me at once: then promised of course to send Ethel a bottle that very night. Oh no, I said. “It’s very slow” he said. And was for a moment touched by my concern.

So back to Ethel. In the artists room afterwards there was Zélie with the red lips, & another ex prima donna & a dissolute musician, all waiting their turn to plague Beecham. Et toi—Zélie suddenly burst into song; but it was 25 years ago that she had her success, since when … And they hinted & shrugged that poor old Ethel was a well known imposition upon conductors. Out she came in her spotted cats fur with her hat askew, carrying her brown cardboard despatch box, upon which they—the tight hard old prima donnas, fell on her & larded her with praise. (They had played the Wreckers overture.) Who are they I said. Havent an idea, she replied. So we had tea at the Langham, which I dont mind so much as meat & gravy. And then I could stand that stab of a voice emphasising, I dont know what, no longer; & said I must go. It was a Sunday evening drizzle in the street, an 1849 night, as we padded very slowly to the Tube: & thank God, she vanished. I was out of temper. But L. miraculously enchanted me again by persuading me not to have Italian lessons from Castelli⁠[?]. For some reason this decision has given me a divine sense of immunity which wraps me round this morning. I am a toad in an oak again: neglected, at ease, completely happy. Nessa & Julian came round to us, for a wonder, after dinner. And we talked about Roger & Margery’s incestuous love. Julian at his best, weighty, reasonable & mature. Thats being with Nessa, I suppose. I said how I tried to ‘rattle’ L. into going to the Walker dinner."
1935.03.06,"It was great fun at Ethel’s party last night, & I enjoyed myself enormously, & I was a success (yes, I think so) with old Tonks, & obliterated Holmes, & the Charles Morgans want to dine, & all that— The difficulty is to combine the two: here & there. If I did much of that I should soon lose my hold on words, I feel: yet, before dinner, I only wanted talk gaiety other people. But thats the difficulty: not to be rubbed smoothed, jerked out into their light random galef?]. Could one manage both, then one would be a writer. Or thats my feeling. And at the age of 53 I still struggle: & still, thank Heaven, feel the rush & the glory & the agony, & never get used to any of it. But I cant write this morning.

An easy shabby party though. Nessa & Duncan made to dine alone, as we were late: I promoted to the high table,—had my little compliment, which pleased me. What I liked was the affability & character of the old saw bones Tonks, for so I called him 30 years ago when he lunched at Gordon Square & was so severe on Nessa’s pictures. Now he was all kindness: & distinguished; & appreciative, & regretting Bloomsbury & the distance between us & Chelsea. Talked of G.M. & Steer—who was there in a clergymans collar: almost hidebound; entirely silent, like a log removed from the fire & stood on end. Prof. Brown slept in his chairman’s seat: Ethel sat by him, silent, muttering in her hoarse voice, with her gnarled dirty fingers, & her hair coming down; then Holmes; Nothing could have been less formidable. A great crowd, & the Morgans as I say—he a fattish man with little pig eyes sunk: the nice respectable earnest successful ashamed of being successful man I imagined. I thought he had heard how I flung The Fountain out of the window: at any rate was a little obsequious. Then his wife came up—English dog eyed woman, brown candid simple. How they would love to dine alone, on a Friday, when Charles neednt go to a theatre. So I easily flood my empty room, if I wish. And then with the surly unhappy opinionative Adrian Daintrey in full evening dress to the Café Royal, which lacks the old romance; but I was glad to snatch a sight of it, & to wonder about life there, for a second. Not many artists, all flashy people who don’t belong anywhere, Daintrey said. How I laughed at Nessa & Duncan made to dine alone, & let in with the dessert. It was Duncan’s fault for being so late coming in. And he slept during the drone of Brown’s 84 year old soliloquy: he couldnt pull up or go on. And Tonks in his airy blue eyed way—he’s grown very transparent—kept interrupting. And then Mrs MacColl, in her French accent called him to order. And the dinner was very bad."
1935.03.11,"How I should like, I thought, some time on the drive up this afternoon, to write a sentence again! How delightful to feel it form & curve under my fingers! Since Oct. 16th I have not written one new sentence, but only copied & typed. A typed sentence somehow differs; for one thing it is formed out of what is already there: it does not spring fresh from the mind. But this copying must go on, I see, till August. I am only now in the first war scene: with luck I shall get to Ea. in Oxford Street before we go in May: & spend June & July on the grand orchestral finale. Then in August I shall write again.

It was the bitterest Sunday for 22 years: we went down [to Rodmell] (there was a little skirmish between us, for when I saw the snow falling I said, what about putting it off? At this L. was I thought unduly annoyed; so that we went—but Lord what a quarrel most old married couples would: have made of it: & it turned to a candid joke before we were half angry). Then on Sunday we went to Sissinghurst: in the bitter wind with the country all lying in its June green & blue outside the window. Now thats an odd observation I have to make. My friendship with Vita is over. Not with a quarrel, not with a bang, but as ripe fruit falls. No I shant be coming to London before I go to Greece, she said. And then I got into the car. But her voice saying “Virginia?” outside the tower room was as enchanting as ever. Only then nothing happened. And she has grown very fat, very much the indolent county lady, run to seed, incurious now about books; has written no poetry; only kindles about dogs, flowers, & new buildings. S⁠[issinghurs]⁠t is to have a new wing; a new garden; a new wall; Well, its like cutting off a picture: there she hangs, in the fishmongers at Sevenoaks, all pink jersey & pearls; & thats an end of it. And there is no bitterness, & no disillusion, only a certain emptiness. In fact—if my hands werent so cold—I could here analyse my state of mind these past 4 months, & account for the human emptiness by the defection of Vita; Roger’s death; & no-one springing up to take their place; & a certain general slackening of letters & fame, owing to my writing nothing; so that I have more time on my hands, & actually ask people to come here now & again. (But the week fills unbidden mostly). On the other hand, I have been less harassed; & have enjoyed reading again, more, I think than for 2 or 3 years past. I have read myself to a standstill in the F.Q.: & shall not press the mood till it returns naturally: I am reading Chateaubriand; & to my joy find I can read an Italian novel for pleasure, currently, easily. Yes, this is all very peaceful & profound, & I like it. But again I am harassed by the thought that Nessa will now take to abroad again—she’s off in a week or two to Italy; &—what else? No, on the whole, save for a desire to break L. of his ‘habits’, I am content to let things alone. I have been to a great many picture shows lately too: to the Nat Gall.; & thats a new picture which I should like to develop among my adumbrations. The truth is, ideas for other books are beginning to stir under the slab of The Pargiters.

Coming back in the snowstorm from Vita’s: the snow was like long ribbons of paper; whipping, mixing, getting entangled in front of the car."
1935.03.16,"I have had 3 severe swingeings lately: Wyndham Lewis; Mirsky; & now Swinnerton. Bloomsbury is ridiculed; & I am dismissed with it. I didnt read W.L.; & Swinnerton only affected me as [a] robin affects a rhinoceros—except in the depths of the night. How resilient I am; & how fatalistic now; & how little I mind, & how much; & how good my novel is; & how tired I am this morning; & how I like praise; & how full of ideas I am; & Tom & Stephen came to tea, & Ray [Strachey] & William [Plomer] dine; & I forgot to describe my interesting talk with Nessa about my criticising her children; & I left out—I forget what.

My head is numb today & I can scarcely read Osbert on Brighton, let alone Dante. Why did Heinemann send me S⁠[winner]⁠ton? to hurt me? And that does hurt 2 seconds. And Rebecca West did answer yesterday, & signs yours ever, & had been ill, & no secretary, so thats done with. And its a warm day, & I wont remind L. that we might have gone to Rodmell. Where shall we go? How happy I am. Tom’s writing a play about T a Becket to be acted in Cy Cathedral. Asks us to tea—very easy & honest & kind to Stephen. Said he wrote the last verses of W⁠[aste].L⁠[and]. in a trance—unconsciously. Said he could not like poetry that had no meaning for the ear. Read lacking in sensuality. Poor Stephen so hurt by reviews of Vienna that he told Tom to withdraw it. Tom advises him to abstain from poetry for a time. Stephen generously praised Day Lewis. Grown heavier, less self-confident. And thats all I can twitter (Swinnerton’s word for me—but: then he admires Mary Webb) this morning. Brighton forward.

In last weeks Time & Tide St John Ervine called Lytton “that servile minded man …. that Pandar” or words to that effect. I’m thinking whether, if I write about Roger, I shall include a note, a sarcastic note, on the Bloomsbury baiters. No, I suppose not. Write them down—thats the only way."
1935.03.18,"The only thing worth doing in this book is to stick it out: stick to the idea, & dont lower it an itch, in deference to anyone. Whats so odd is the way the whole thing dissolves in company: & then comes back with a rush; & Swinnerton’s sneers, & Mirsky’s—making me feel that I’m hated & despised & ridiculed—well, this is the only answer: to stick to my ideas. And I wish I need never read about myself, or think about myself, anyhow till its done, but look firmly at my object & think only of expressing it. Oh what a grind it is embodying all these ideas, & having perpetually to expose my mind, opened & intensified as it is by the heat of creation to the blasts of the outer world. If I didn’t feel so much, how easy it would be to go on—"
1935.03.20,"Having just written a letter about Bloomsbury I cannot control my mind enough to go on with the P.s. I woke in the night & thought of it. But whether to send it or not, I dont know. But now I must think of something else. Julian & Helen [Anrep] last night. Helen much improved by her loss. Sweeter, softer, more sympathetic. We talked—I forget—easily enough, about Ha. Helen anti Ha, naturally. And Julian was twitchy but amiable. A hot spring day. Desmond rang up, asking us to dine.

L. advised me not to send the letter. And after 2 seconds I see he is right. It is better he says to be able to say we dont answer. But we suggest a comic guide to Bloomsbury by Morgan & he nibbles."
1935.03.21,"Too jaded again to tackle that very difficult much too crowded raid chapter. In fact I am on the verge of the usual headache—for one thing yesterday was such a scramble—I walked so many miles, talked so much difficult political French with a man called Malraux up at Hampstead; having first gone to Q.’s private view; the usual mincing & demurring: smart young men; little Robertson whom I met at the Fishers: Clive in his blue suit; Benita in her tight black: & then the constraint with Nessa about her sons art—as usual: am I too critical? Why this difficulty in praising? Bought nothing. Couldn’t think: walked in the hot sun through the Parks to W⁠[estminste]⁠r. Took Bus up to Hampstead; stood all the way. Crowded dining room. M⁠[alraux]. the fluent idealogical foreigner. Stephen Spender, Read—other unknowns. Exalted to a kind of eminence among this rag tag. Listened. To be a conference, of artists, in June. Paris in June—oh, too tired to note even this, so how can I tackle fiction? Rodmell tomorrow—thank goodness."
1935.03.22,"I have resolved to leave that blasted Chapter here, & do nothing at Rodmell. Yet, as I see, I cannot read; my mind is all tight like a ball of string. A most unpleasant variety of headache; but I think, soon over. Only a little change needed. Not a real bad headache. Why make this note? Because reading is beyond me, & writing is like humming a song. But what a worthless song! And it is the spring. Ethel last night—dear old woman, so wise in her way; but her voice is like a needle stabbing stuff. And so I got more tight wound than ever. But still I felt, she is generous & ample—a note to make for her portrait."
1935.03.25,"Last night at Nessa’s, talk all very chippy & choppy with Clive oddly inattentive, & a sense of unreality, & a great desire for Roger. Again the sense of him coming in with his great dark eyes, & his tie pin & his brown shoes & how, speaking in that very deep voice he would have discussed Max Eastman & Epstein. We only flick the surface—some means of communication—some other instrument needed to combine us all in harmony. Stories that would have amused him. How he wd have laughed at Nessa’s [lost] story of the party at Lady Harris’s when they had the lantern slides of the tigers. And all would have been deepened, & made suggestive. But never mind. This is inevitable, & we must blow on the bellows. So I tried to be nice about Quentin. And this morning, in spite of being in a rage, I wrote the whole of that d—d chapter again, in a spasm of desperation & I think got it right, by breaking up, the use of thought skipping, & parentheses. Anyhow thats the hang of it. And I cut from 20 to 30 pages."
1935.03.26,"A very nice dinner at MacCarthy’s last night. Desmond flung the door open & almost kissed me. But thats not our formula. So glad to see us—He looks firmer & pinker. And there was Hope & Dermod & Molly gay & amiable & not so deaf. And we talked of America. Very kind, quite untaught. D. never allowed to pay. He had enjoyed himself immensely, only netted £150 though. And he was concerned about the attacks on Lytton & says Swinnerton has a grudge because he is selfmade. This had annoyed him more than us (a vindication of me is in the Times this morning; so we score of course by being attacked & saying nothing.) Molly as I say affectionate, very happy & prosperous all the M⁠[acCarthy]⁠s. I think: Dermod now a doctor, a weak looking but somehow alert & alive young man, discussing germs with L.; Hope on a diet of course. He put matches on the floor to represent germs. I couldn’t burrow into Desmond as Molly had to be supplied. Dear me, friendship is a very happy thing. And nothing needs to be said. And I forget—We took Hope to her little Close, behind the Oratory, like a scene in the Meister-singers. We discussed the case of Harry Norton; the effect of discouragement—what D⁠[esmond]. calls Almhousing—the wish he has to retire & live on tea & bread alone in obscurity. But I said something always turns up, which is true. He had been lunching with Austen Chamberlain, who says Germany can only be treated like a slave: wont contemplate giving her anything. Patriotism is the devil—yes."
1935.03.27,"I see I am becoming a regular diariser. The reason is that I cannot make the transition from Pargiters to Dante without some bridge. And this cools my mind. I am rather worried about the raid chapter: afraid if I compress & worry that I shall spoil. Never mind. Forge ahead, & see what comes next. Lydia also interrupted, carrying a copy of Mirsky in her hand, very abusive of him. She is going to write and tell him that she thinks him a dirty little cad. She cannot come to meet the Morgans, as they are off for Easter to Charleston. So thats on us.

Yesterday we went to the Tower, which is an impressive murderous bloody grey raven haunted military barrack prison dungeon place; like the prison of English splendour; the reformatory at the back of history; where we shot & tortured & imprisoned. Prisoners scratched their names, very beautifully, on the walls. And the crown jewels blazed, very tawdry, & there were the orders, like Spinks or a Regent St jewellers. And we watched the Scots Guards drill; & an officer doing a kind of tiger pace up & down—a wax faced barbers block officer trained to a certain impassive balancing. The sergeant major barked & swore. All in a hoarse bark: the men stamped & wheeled like—machines: then the officer also barked: all precise inhuman, showing off—a degrading, a stupifying sight, but in keeping with the grey wall the cobbles the executioner’s block. People sitting on the river bank among old cannon. Ships &c. Very romantic: a dungeon like feeling.

So home & Elizabeth Read & Denny suddenly appeared. To have a child in August, very pretty, genuine, high principled. Talked about herself, Denny, his debts, his Dutch wife, how he is insurance agent, drives an old car about Yorkshire. They live in rooms at Sheffield, have a cottage at Caradoc. I liked her—an odd wisp, truculent, courageous, to be blown across. He a classical scholar, but a ‘mut’. Cant sleep or eat. But they are going to mend matters by having a child."
1935.03.28,"Another bridge between P.s & Dante. But I think I have actually done the Raid this morning. A nice quiet evening last night, L. at his Mit⁠[?]; & I sitting reading over the fire. Nobody came for once. So that there is no call to make a note—unless to remind myself of the domestic atmosphere at the M⁠[acCarthy]⁠s: Desmond as father: the sense of other lives growing & changing. I am bothered by tomorrows dinner though. Cant get anyone to meet the Morgans, yet fight shy of a solitary evening, wrongly perhaps. Raymond going to the Grand National. William has the flu. But this is not much of a roseleaf under the pillow after all. Spring triumphant. Crocuses going over. Daffodils & hyacinths out. Some chestnut leaves in the birds claw stage in the park. The country trees & Square trees bare still. Little bushes all green. I want to make vegetable notes for my book. How soft & springy & fresh the air was yesterday—like the sea! And I think of being abroad. But we have not yet decided where to go."
1935.03.30,"Charles Morgans to dinner last night. Nessa, Duncan & [John] Graham in afterwards. Not an alarming pair, the Ms. He rather sunk eyed & official: she—oh how she interrupted! Vague, vapid, well meaning. Oh but Charles you must tell them the Hancock story—Charles you mustn’t be modest &c. We were talking about the Navy: Charles wrote a book showing up the bullying of midshipmen. How they were made to do “evolutions” 4 nights out of 7. Evolutions meant jumping over chairs & being beaten. Then they drank with the beaters; were then beaten again. Those who are not virgins must report that they have had such & such women of the town by Saturday. One of them wrote it in his diary, sent it to his parson father, who reported to the Admiralty. They appealed to his patriotism. He threatened to go to Carmelite House [Daily Mail]: there was an enquiry & his son resigned. Morgan a well meaning cultivated egoist, little sunk eyes ‘[word illegible]’ like Jowitt. Lives on a plan so as to get as much out of himself as possible. Bed at 2, after the play. Breakfast at 9 in bed: writes novels from 4 to 7. So it goes on, & The Fountain is the result. Occasionally a light came in his sunk eyes; about the Dreadnought for example; but he is colourless & pale like one of the D. of Newcastle’s horses. She’s flyaway, visualises, sees, where Charles, if theyre walking in a wood, remembers—I walked here once. Charles’ father built Victoria Station & showed Charles a picture of Chatterton to dissuade him from poetry. Must have a profession & write at leisure. So at 11 he chose the Navy. Then went to Walkley, was made his understudy on the Times: will there remain, hoarding his novel money for his children. One’s 8, the other 10. A very well meaning honourable but sunken man. Graham roared with laughter when they left & said Mrs Morgan was the image of John Braddock’s wife [unidentified]. Very red & young: has shaven his beard; talked to Nessa."
1935.03.30,"Some chestnut trees in the Park just coming out. Small leaves."
1935.03.31,"Tea with Tom yesterday. A small angular room, with the district railway on one side, Cornwall Gardens on the other. A great spread; rolls in frills of paper. A dark green blotting paper wall paper, & books rather meagre, stood on top of each other; bookcases with shelves missing. Not a lovely room. A coloured print from an Italian picture. Nothing nice to look at. Purple covers. Respectable china “A present” said Tom; he was perched on a hard chair. I poured out tea. There was Mrs Munro, a handsome swarthy Russian looking woman in a black astrachan cap. And it was heavy going. All about cars; the jubilee; publishing; a German boy; a little literary gossip; feet conscientiously planting themselves in the thick sand; & I not liking to go too soon, & so sitting till we were all glad when Mrs M. got up, & Tom was glad, & showed us his bedroom—a section, getting the railway under it. “I forgot to ask you to drink sherry” he said, pointing to sherry & glasses on the bedroom window sill. A pallid very cold experience. He stood on the steps—it is the Kensington Rectory & he shares a bath with curates. The hot water runs very slowly. Sometimes he takes the bath prepared for the curates. A large faced pale faced man—our great poet. And no fire burning in any of us. I discover a certain asperity in him towards the woman⁠[?]—a priestly attitude. Here he gets warmed up a little. But the decorous ugliness, the maid in cap & apron, the embroidered cloth, the ornamental kettle on the mantelpiece all somehow depressed me. And as I say it was a bitter cold day & we have seen too many literary gents. How heavenly to sleep over the fire! Tom’s was a gas fire.

A long letter from Vita, by the way, about Ethel’s attack on her. She asks me why? Happily I can truthfully say I told her not to write. At the same time I agree with Ethel’s opinion of that menage more than I like (see whichever page it is). And I think E. though V. tries to think her absurd, has said something true, in her violent unnecessary way. But whats the use?"
1935.04.01,"At this rate I shall never finish the Purgatorio. But whats the use of reading with half ones mind running on Eleanor & Kitty. Oh that scene wants compacting. Its too thin run. But I shall finish it before I go away. We think of 3 weeks in Holland & France: a week in Rome, flying there. We went to Kew yesterday, & if vegetable notes are needed, this is to signify that yesterday was the prime day for cherry blossom pear trees, & magnolia. A lovely white one with black cups to the flowers: another purple tinted, just falling. Another & another. And the yellow bushes & the daffodils in the grass. So to walk through Richmond—a long walk by the ponds. I verified certain details. And it was 5.30 when we got back—a soft lovely day; & then I read some MSS & we had out maps, & discussed the holiday & Mabel came in & said she had sat for 2 hours in the Piccadilly [Lyons] corner house, watching people & listening to the band. Many people do this, she said. They sit on & on, eating as slowly as possible. She was ashamed how long they had sat. But then they take a long time to bring things she said.

A letter of thanks & admiration from Mrs Morgan this morning. And I gather from Judith that poor old Ann has not passed."
1935.04.02,"But poor old Ann has not only passed, but won a minor scholarship: Judith was only indulging in chaff. We had Ann to dinner & took her to Bengal Lancers: but the virility & empire building bored her. She thinks for herself, or has the youthful point of view naturally that we acquired through satire. She was not satirical, merely bored—a good sign, if she is representative.

And it was a very cold day: & I read, in this room; & was glad not to pace the streets. I have now Enid Bagnold’s rather (I suspect) meretricious & much applauded book to read [National Velvet], Whats wrong with it? My nose is sniffing already. A letter of warm gratitude—why?—from Vita: says I AM a good friend, & have never failed her. Some muddle I dont fathom altogether, but suspect Gwen & St. John between them have fuddled poor old V.’s not very well founded head. Rather a lesson, not to write angry letters.

And does Louie cheat? A bill for a chicken that we had at Christmas again throws doubt on her. We must have it out about the milk this week. Not a week I want altogether. Angelica’s concert on Thursday: a [Labour Party] meeting at Rodmell. Leonard’s jury again put off."
1935.04.05,"Angelica’s last concert yesterday in a snowstorm. And we took the wrong turning & went in the sleet almost to Southend. Snow falling all the time across the dark yew trees. And not a very rich performance. Angelica acting. Judith reciting French with a perfect accent, mothers in the drawing room. A great tea. Mrs Curtis opulent. The usual things—& so home in the cold—Duncan asleep.

L. dined at the Cranium & met James who says he means, owing to Swinnerton & other attacks, to set about a very long life of Lytton with all the letters; & he wishes to ‘lay it down’ that what he wants is that I should write a character of Lytton as introduction. Lytton & Roger—so my work as a biographer is cut out—I wonder. But I’m glad, I think, that there should be a full & outspoken life. Only not as a reply to criticism. And then the buggery? But it will take James a long time. The usual heartless, cold day & we go to Rodmell. And I’m tired of writing; yet must press on & do this difficult chapter; which I shall get done before we go—to Holland we think on May 1st—3 weeks & 4 days. Oh to sit in the sun & let my mind browse!"
1935.04.08,"A week end of almost incessant conversation: first Mr Hancock on Wormwood Scrubs; then Maynard on the New Statesman. Both were full of interest—but oh dear, how I grudge the silent evening reading gone! And it rains & rains. Came home in the rain, dined with Helen in the rain; went to Clive’s: rain pouring down when we drove Nessa back. All sat in Clive’s little room, as Angelica was in the big room. Talk of Dorothea & of the Statesman. Duncan snapping viciously at Kingsley. Duncan when he’s angry snaps. Nessa is terrifically monolithic & imperious—a terrifying woman in her way. And I almost laughed myself sick over Dorothea. And it was slightly empty as usual—but why? Without Roger, I suppose: & we’re all so formal & going abroad for weeks—Clive so unintimate nowadays. We must ask him to dinner in June.

And it is pelting on my skylight, & the rain has come through the roof, & I am rather jangled writing this restaurant chapter, & wish we could sit in the sun, & wish I were a more solid & capable woman; & yet manage to cut along. Here’s Boulestin asking us to lunch—must I go? What an effort. Helen with her children rather ineffective but alive; the 2 gawks chattering easily"
1935.04.09,"I met Morgan in the London Library yesterday & flew into a passion.

“Virginia, my dear” he said. I was pleased by that little affectionate familiar tag.

“Being a good boy & getting books on Bloomsbury?” I said.

“Yes. You listen. Is my book down?” he asked Mr Mannering.

“We were just posting it” said Mr M.

“And Virginia, you know I’m on the Co⁠[mmi]⁠ttee here” said Morgan. “And we’ve been discussing whether to allow ladies—

It came over me that they were going to put me on: & I was then to refuse: Oh but they do—I said. There was Mrs Green …

“Yes yes—there was Mrs Green. And Sir Leslie Stephen said, never again. She was so troublesome. And I said, havent ladies improved? But they were all quite determined. No no no, ladies are quite impossible. They wouldnt hear of it.”

See how my hand trembles. I was so angry (also very tired) standing. And I saw the whole slate smeared. I thought how perhaps M. had mentioned my name, & they had said no no no: ladies are impossible. And so I quieted down & said nothing & this morning in my bath I made up a phrase in my book on Being Despised which is to run—a friend of mine, who was offered….. one of those prizes—for her sake the great exception was to be made—who was in short to be given an honour—I forget what—.. She said, And they actually thought I would take it. They were, on my honour, surprised, even at my very modified & humble rejection. You didnt tell them what you thought of them for daring to suggest that you should rub your nose in that pail of offal? I remarked. Not for a hundred years, she observed. And I will bring in M. Pattison: & I will say sympathy uses the same force required to lay 700 bricks. And I will show how you cant sit on Ctees if you also pour out tea—that by the way Sir L.S. spent his evenings with widow Green; yes, these flares up are very good for my book: for they simmer & become transparent: & I see how I can transmute them into beautiful clear reasonable ironical prose. God damn Morgan for thinking I’d have taken that … And dear old Morgan comes to tea today, & then sits with Bessy [Trevelyan] who’s had cataract.

The veil of the temple—which, whether university or cathedral, was academic or ecclesiastical I forget—was to be raised, & as an exception she was to be allowed to enter in. But what about my civilisation? For 2,000 years we have done things without being paid for doing them. You cant bribe me now.

Pail of offal? No; I said I was a while very deeply appreciating the hon…. In short one must tell lies, & apply every emollient in our power to the swollen & inflamed skin of our brothers so terribly inflamed vanity. Truth is only to be spoken by those women whose fathers were pork butchers & left them a share in the pig factory."
1935.04.12,"This little piece of rant wont be very intelligible in a years time. Yet there are some useful facts & phrases in it. I rather itch to be at that book. But I have been skirmishing round a headache, & cant pull my weight in the morning. It is now almost settled that we shall drive through Holland & Germany, concealing Leonard’s nose, to Rome; & so back. A giant tour on our most heroic scale. Indeed, L. has just been in to say that we have to have the car tested this afternoon; also that the first of the spring flowers is up—Mr Brace, alas. Day after day is thus blotted out.

Last night I dined with Nessa, L. being at Kingsley’s to hear the story of his divided mind. He cant make up his mind, & must display the separated parts, like a heaving oyster, to his friends. Sometimes thinks he is going mad. Everybody turns him. He makes up his mind to refuse Aberystwyth with Maynard: in comes Gerald Barry, pours scorn on journalism, K. seizes the telephone, rings up A.; says Is there still time to put my name forward? Next day the horror of A. descends on him. Goes to a psycho-analyst. Goes to Scilly Islands with his father, meets the Arnold-Forsters—rings us up at 9 this morning; wants Cleano. Meanwhile Olga threatens divorce or claims it—I forget which—& loves another, & is rejected & lives in Fitzroy Square. But I sat over the stove with Nessa & Duncan musing & rambling & discussing old Desmond’s passions for American ladies—which is the reason why Molly seeks Freiburg for six months. And they were making plates on a new system, & off today to Stoke on Trent, & so Angelica dines here—a talented youngster the Star calls her, in a paragraph that seems founded on fact.

A wild wet spring. I had the courage to wear my silver corduroy. Lord, what a shivering coward I am—but not as a writer. No. I stick to that by way of compensation.

Desmond received a deputation of his children in his room the other day to ask him to give up his love, for Molly’s sake. Upon which he said, that he thought he could assure them that it was the beginning of the end. The spit & image of Mr Micawber, as Nessa says. L. much upset by the inefficiency of electric lamps. I bought one at the Stores yesterday, for my travels, & it is too small to take an ordinary bulb. This is the kind of thing that genuinely annoys L. But I am merely running on, in order to waste the precious morning."
1935.04.13,"Poor Kingsley Martin almost in tears on the telephone this morning—cant make up his mind—certainly gives me an added sense of power & happiness."
1935.04.14,"Let me make a note that it would be much wiser not to attempt to sketch a draft of On Being Despised, or whatever it is to be called, until the P.s is done with. I was vagrant this morning & made a rash attempt, with the interesting discovery that one cant propagate at the same time as write fiction. And as this fiction is dangerously near propaganda, I must keep my hands clear.

Its true I’m half asleep, after the Zoo & Willy [Robson]. But he threw some coals on my fire: the horror of the legal profession: its immense wealth; its conventions: a Royal Comn. now sitting—its hidebound hoariness, & so on; worth going into one of these days; & the medical profession & the osteopaths—worth a fling of laughter. But oh dear, not now. Now for Alfieri & Nash & other notables: so happy I was reading alone last night. We saw the great dumb fish at the Zoo, & the Gorillas. Storms of rain, cloud: & I read Annie S. Swan on her life with considerable respect. Almost always this comes from Au⁠[tobiograph]⁠y: a liking, at least some imaginative stir: for no doubt her books, which she cant count, & has no illusions about, but she cant stop telling stories, are wash, pigs, hogs—any wash you choose. But she is a shrewd capable old woman."
1935.04.15,"Not a very nice last meeting at Nessa’s last night, because L. suddenly turned stony in the way I know: & cut up rusty, when we got back, ostensibly because I suggested staying not 7 days but 10 in Rome. I suppose it was the old family grievance moling again; throwing up sudden hills. But this is all silly rot, I said, as I waited for him to come & he didn’t come; so went in & laughed. The truth is he had spent the whole morning filling up forms for our journey—which, I say, I could have done; & then I upset his plans in favour of my family, & stayed talking. And he had 2 hours of Willy: & is tired. And come to think of it, we’re both very happy. I shall be glad when we can stretch a little at Monks House, & needn’t meet Bells & so start moling. By way of reward for my sweetness of temper—but what does L. think of my temper? my book went well today; I think it probably rather good.

Yesterday another defence of Bloomsbury by Ellis Roberts in the S. Times: of me in particular (thanks I think to my ‘charm’ at Ottoline’s;) I am the most original mind that has written novels in the past 20 years, & so on. Nessa is going to Cochran this morning about a new curtain for one of his shows, & I’m not jealous. But oh how nice to have all this done with for six weeks! Now to write a little Italian from Danaro. I will learn German next year."
1935.04.17,"So the move, anyhow the Bell move, which heralds the flock, has begun: Angelica rushed in here at 1 yesterday with patterns for my clothes—such is her passion—and left her cap behind, & today—a fine day so far—they’re off [to Rome]. Tomorrow we go to Rodmell, & when Brace, at 7, shut the door—no, I stood in the door—but slowly put on his coat, & made some very polite remark about seeing us in New York—when all this happened, I sank back & thought the holiday has begun. For I had been trying on a dress at Murray’s, in the bitter cold wind. I counted 20 between one of Brace’s words & the next; he has grown toad faced, but is all the same a decent long suffering man. Things looking up in America, so he said.

I forget—I had something in mind to write here, about ‘the soul’ perhaps. I’m jaded again, & can’t go on rewriting. The book is to be sent to America in October: may be serialised—if so won’t be out for a year. But I have still £990. Something about Spender’s book had I in mind? To jot down a few notes on it. No. about the soul. Breaking moulds. Coming out with views. A French article calls me the Fairy of Eng. lit. Odd how this fairy works then.

The Wigrams a little defensive about Jews in Germany: want to come over & see us—Susie Buchan asks us to stay. Now these painful visits are in fact the real breaking up of the soul: such a labour. And L. gets more & more addicted to solitude & astute—the old wretch—at finding good reasons for it. But then his hand trembles; mine doesnt—could I overcome the clothes fear. The soul—the soul—How far could I let myself go in an anti fascist pamphlet? I think of dashing off my professions for women, can I steal a moment between Roger Lytton & proofs. All this about being so distinguished & cultivated might be knocked on the head. In E⁠[lvira]’s soliloquy I think I have tapped a new method of argument—very short & compact: but then this is spun out with description. The sun blazes: my skylight blue; no white tufted. I’m reading, or going to read, Alfieri, Chateaubriand, Paxton, Leo Myers; Barker & Moore poetry; so Easter will fly—oh to be alone with our fine York ham. No, I’ve forgotten the soul."
1935.04.18,"This is written with very dirty hands after tidying up. We go [to Rodmell] after lunch. But shall we be alone? I doubt it. I foresee Julian, Wigram & Kingsley Martin, who again rang up, is now inclined to go to A⁠[berystwyth]: but L. bets that he will stay at the N.S. And he said—I listened in—Suppose I’m walking on the Downs, might I come & see you? Oh God, I thought, divining that he has a craving for our society—that is to talk about himself. “Or do you want to be alone?” L. who is his confessor, said, as confessors must, damn them, No do come. And physically he’s so repulsive. A fineish sort of day. I bought a coffee mill at Fortnum yesterday, & going to look for lamps saw [Derrick] Leon, advising customers about fabrics in their wholly disgusting room, all strewn with luxury objects in the worst most opulent heartless brainless taste: women in black with white pearls & red lips. The atmosphere of a rich princely shop is not sympathetic. A kind of halfway house: a shop not a shop; shop people pseudo gentry: an attempt to seduce & coerce. The chimney lamp was 25/6 instead of 19 18/9 as at the Stores. Six shillings to pay for lipstick & scent & carpets & the casual gentlemanly manners of Mr Marshall & the strew & the carelessness. I watched a gentleman selling Easter eggs with powder puffs, to the head buyer, who might have been Christabel.

And so home. And no one came, & that was one of Gods blessings. And I’m fidgetting, getting ready. Miss West doesnt get on with Belsher; is spending Easter at Folkestone, which she dislikes. But Miss Walton is going to Amsterdam."
1935.04.20,"The scene has now changed to Rodmell, & I am writing at the table L. made (supported on a cushion,) & it is raining. Good Friday, was a complete fraud—rain & more rain. I tried walking along the bank, & saw a mole, running on the meadow—it glides father—is like an elongated guinea pig. Pinka went & nuzzled it, & then it managed to slide into a hole. At the same time through the rain I heard the cuckoo’s song. Then I came home & read & read—Stephen Spender [The Destructive Element]; too quick to stop to think; shall I stop to think; read it again? It has considerable swing & fluency; & some general ideas; but peters out in the usual litter of an undergraduates table. Wants to get everything in & report and answer all the chatter. But I want to investigate certain questions: why do I always fight shy of my contemporaries? What is really the woman’s angle? Why does so much of this seem to me in the air? But I recognise my own limitations: not a good ratiocinator, Lytton used to say. Do I instinctively keep my mind from analysing, which would impede its creativeness? I think there’s something in that. No creative writer can swallow another contemporary. The reception of living work is too coarse & partial if youre doing the same thing yourself. But I admire Stephen for trying to grapple with these problems. Only of course he has to hitch them round—to use his own predicament as a magnet, & thus the pattern is too arbitrary; if you’re not in his predicament. But as I say, I read it at a gulp without screwing my wits tight to the argument. This is a method I find very profitable: then go back & screw.

In the public world, there are emphatic scares. L. brings home a bunch after every Cttee meeting. Its odd how seldom I report them. One of these days they may come true. For instance, Toller says we are on the brink of war. Wants the allies to declare war on Hitler. Belgium keeps its aeroplanes at active service level, all ready to rise into the air. But as Germany could be on them before they rose this seems useless. There is a dutiful perfunctory stir about the Jubilee. We have subscribed £3 towards buns & a bus shelter in Rodmell. It is a good excuse for buying what one wants. Piccadilly is marked with Venetian masts. Seats line all the main streets. The King is said to be almost comatose. Will he get through with his bowings? C. Morgan said he cant bend any longer. And—there are incessant conversations—Mussolini, Hitler, Macdonald. All these people incessantly arriving at Croydon, arriving at Berlin, Moscow, Rome; & flying off again—while Stephen & I think how to improve the world."
1935.04.22,"The Wigrams to tea; she in white checks, checked shoes, yellow curls, blue eyes, disappointed, embittered, growing old, growing fat, something like an old daisy or other simple garden flower; if a flower could look very unhappy. I suppose the deformed boy, & so on. He a cripple, with iron rods down one leg, hoisting himself about on a stick. This, I suppose, faintly disgusting physically to her. I suppose she lives with physical deformity. But she is too painted & powdered, too insipidly discontented. He is very white toothed, blue eyed, lean, red cheeked—a nice rigid honest public school Englishman. Started almost at once telling us about Hitler. He had been at Berlin with Simon. Got there early & stood at the Embassy window watching the crowd. They clustered, & a policeman held up his hand, & they obediently fell back. No resistance. Then the conversations began. Hitler very impressive; very frightening. A large picture of the Madonna & Child & one of Bismarck. He has a great jowl like Bismarck. Made speeches lasting 20 minutes with out a failure. Very able. Only one mistake on a complicated point. Very well coached. And all the time a tapping sound. Wigram thought An odd day to have the masons in. But it was the sentry marching up & down the passage. Everything came out. We want…. We have a parity in the air already. The Germans in fact have enough aeroplanes ready to start to keep us under. But if they do kill us all? Well they will have their Colonies. I want room to move about Hitler said. Must be equal, & so on. A complete reversal to pre-war days. No ideals except equality, superiority, force, possessions. And the passive heavy slaves behind him, and he a great mould coming down on the brown jelly. Talks of himself as the regenerator, the completely equipped & powerful machine. Says outright, “If I had been in control during the war, things might have gone very differently.” Wigram & the rest frightened. Anything may happen at any moment. Here in England we havent even bought our gas masks. Nobody takes it seriously. But having seen this mad dog, the thin rigid Englishmen are really afraid. And if we have only nice public schoolboys like W. to guide us, there is some reason I suppose to expect that Oxford Street will be flooded with poison gas one of these days. And what then? Germany will get her colonies.

And then we walked them round the garden, & they were, or said they were, envious & impressed. But as Mrs W. said to me, I am effusive. I was brought up in France. She has been used to listen to real talk—so she says: to buy clothes twice a year on the 9th March & Autumn, & then never to think of it again.—Here in London with my sisters of the Foreign Office she is, she says, bored, discontented, thinks of cutting the London season & staying at Southease; where, I fear, we shall now be frequently asked, to help with the garden.

And then Kingsley rang up & is now imminent. So I intend to walk."
1935.04.23,"Kingsley coming at eleven of our first fine morning & staying till 6 has completely taken away any power I may have over the art of fiction. In order to ensure myself 2 hours of silence & air I went off to Moggery Poke. I passed 2 really happy women sitting on the slope of Itford hill. As they smiled at me, I thought I would act the scene of Eleanor & the builder—went to them & said Did you speak? No they had not spoken. But they were very happy. I then went on—but it was a grey morning—to Moggery: & home by the river. And there was K. eating cold veal & sweeping up his cauliflower on his fork. An effusive slippery mind: always on the fizz: but how undistinguished! How without hardness or fineness of texture! & now of course all dissolved by personal anxieties into a chatter of egotism: “Is there anything more we can say about my affairs?” he remarked at 3. No, I said to myself, there is nothing more. For he had been flooding us with damp proof sheets—sticky with printers ink—all the morning. Should he stay or should he go? I could only amuse myself by probing the depths of his belief in the N.S. Directly I minimised its importance, he trotted out arguments to prove its immense value to the world. The only paper that tells the truth, the stay & bread of all the serious minded in Britain. Then, directly I’m alone with him, its his arthritis. True, he’s not quite in his right mind; but how tiring this shambling through the hot sand is! & how undistinguished—well meaning, good hearted, I doubt not, but self obsessed; with no ear or eye; no reflective faculty & catching at any straw to float on; talking profusely; sociable because afraid of being alone; with no core of truth or substance in him; garrulous, untidy, slovenly; ‘able’ as they say, quick to snatch, a snapper up of trifles, uninteresting—yes, a profoundly uninteresting man. Yet, Aberystwith is ready to pay him £1000 a year: so he must have some merchantable quality. But it is like reading a living newspaper, talking to K. He is full of short snippets. And why so dull? He runs off my mind like a torrent of lukewarm water, but leaves it stained & tired. It is like listening to a perpetual leading article, so admirable, so well meaning, so shallow."
1935.04.25,"Whether it was Kingsley or not, the usual headache wings its way about me, rather like a fowl soaring & settling & giving me a peek in my back: clouding my mind. I think I have earned a headache & a holiday. But it remains cold. And I am not going to write a word of fiction till June 1st. Weak coffee, this morning, a badly cleaned fish; which L. visits upon the Cow, who cooked us an admirable dinner last night all the same. Must she go? An inveterate instinctive dislike on L.’s part, physical not rational. So cant be overcome. I can read Pirandello almost currently; but cant write, head begins protesting. I shall space my days quietly & buy clothes: no only shoes, I think."
1935.04.27,"All desire to practise the art of a writer has completely left me. I cannot imagine what it would be like: that is, more accurately, I cannot curve my mind to the line of a book: no, nor of an article. Its not the writing but the architecting that strains. If I write this paragraph, then there is the next & then the next. But after a months holiday I shall be as tough & springy as—say heather root; & the arches & the domes will spring into the air as firm as steel & light as cloud—but all these words miss the mark.

Stephen Spender demands a letter of criticism; cant write it. Nor can I describe with any certainty Mrs Collett, with whom both L. & I fell in love yesterday. A whippet woman: steel blue eyes; silver spotted jersey; completely free, edged, outspoken, the widow of the Lord Mayor’s son, who was killed before her eyes flying. After that she broke down, & the only cure she said was to go to Hong Kong & stay with Bella. From that we did not expect anything much, to tell the truth; whereas she ridiculed the Jubilee, the Lord Mayor & told us all about life in the Mansion House. The L.M. spends £20,000 out of his own pocket on his year of office; 10,000 on his sheriffdom; then buys an ermine coat for £1000 in which to admit the King to Temple Bar. It rains; the King flashes past, & the coat is spoilt. I dont like my father in law, she said; he doesnt do it at all well. Her mother in law is a perfectly natural sensible woman who goes buying fish with a bag. The Queen gave her as a token of esteem 2 huge shells, engraved with the story of George & the dragon. These mercifully are left at the M⁠[ansion] House. The L.M. wears a dress that is Heavy with bullion. A terrible state of display & ugliness—but she was so nice & unexcited I actually asked her to come & see us—which, had she known it, is a compliment we never never pay even: the royal family. But I cannot write even here; so shall read a story by Pirandello. James & Alix to dine to discuss Lytton’s life I suppose."
1935.04.28,"Very cold again. Trees dotted with green in the park yesterday. Chestnuts just beginning to flower. A black sky & the paper festoons looking purple & pink across the streets: large blue paper crowns & roses being delivered. Julian & Alix to dine, James having a cold. Conversation: whether one can give people a substitute for war. Must have the danger emotion: must climb mountains, fight bulls; but this emotion mixed, I say, with philosophy, doesnt last more than a few months in case of war. J. says all the young men are communists in order to gratify their desire to do things together & in order to have some danger; which will only last a few months. The Germans being very poor, think anything is better than this. But this was not the 1914 emotion. Lust & danger. Cant cut them out at once. Must divert them on to some harmless object. But what? Some fantasy must be provided. I say many people have found life exciting without war and bull fighting. Has war ever won any cause? Alix says our civil war.

I made up some of my Professions book. Obviously, Julian’s quite unaware of some of his own motives, at the same time very lively & energetic. Alix like a blackshirt, all brown & tie & tailor made. No talk of Lytton: all argument; but interesting. What is the use of trying to preach when human nature is so crippled?"
1935.04.29,"I should be tidying the room, but I’m not. Everything scattered with winters soot & cigarette ash. The great joy of having money is that one can buy small treats for the journey—new shoes. And even give way to the temptation of a 30/- dress. Murray came & I tactfully showed him the blue taffeta; our relations are an odd mix of the friendly & employed. He gave me this blouse, so I gather. But he will dress me for the part of the Dss of Malfi, even in day clothes.

A long letter of enthusiasm from Mrs Ellis Roberts; her husband is writing on me to emphasize my heart, which Swinnerton denied. Dear me. I thought W. Lewis said I was sentimental—between the 3 of them!

But I was about to say that everything is a little slack now I’m not writing. Odd to be off that wave. But I want to experiment with pure external living for a month—looking sharing, taking in ideas & impressions And then watch how the old trout at the bottom of the pond rise. I predict that the desire to write will become so frantic by the time were on the way back that I shall be making up all along the French roads. At the moment I start an idea but it fades; cant write it without feeling my brain stretched; cant even write to Stephen Spender about his book. A fine spring morning, very quiet, birds chirping, all London busy wrapping up parcels for the Jubilee.

Journey to Holland, Germany, Italy & France.

May 1935"
1935.05.06,"Zutphen

This is Jubilee day, it strikes me; a very hot fine day. As for Holland: in the first place the cows wear coats; then the cyclists go in flocks like starlings, gathering together, skimming in & out. Driving is dangerous. Towns are large. They are also strung out, mile on mile. We are back in 1913. Everywhere there are shops full of clothes, food, books. The people are dressed in perfect respectability. Sailors wear felt hats. From 10 to 25 the girls are elegant, dove grey, slender, skimming on their cycles in & out. From 30 to 50 they amass vast bodies. But always the bodies are tight, spruce, shoes elegant hair beautifully done (& there I’ve dropped cigarette ash on the perfectly clean sheets of this modest empty hotel). Every street is 16th or 17th century, with curved apricot coloured awnings. As we say, the houses are the glory of Holland—the richly carved big windowed houses; some lean a little, others are peaked; but each is a solid spruce perfectly self respecting house, in which last night I saw the Sunday diners, old men old women sitting round with children, cactuses; a cat & a dog. We have 20 people round us wherever we stop. The apzi—the kleine apzi! I forget exactly how it all goes. Towns too big of course: Amsterdam a swollen stone monster, shaved off like a ruin on the side of the marsh: our first lunch at the Hague had 20 courses. Very expensive. Meals very early. People immensely respectable. No sign of crisis or war; The man on the ferry, said like all the rest, they wished they had gone off the gold standard. No visitors. Trade with England ended. Oh but the carved doors, the curved white façades, the, lilac trees: the air of swept & garnished prosperity, antiquity, air, cleanliness. Here in Zutphen—but we’ve only arrived 2 hours & had our Mitzi levée, & then came to this modest Inn, with a canal outside; & a broad river beyond.

Ideas that struck me.

That the more complex a vision the less it lends itself to satire: the more it understands the less it is able to sum up & make linear. For example: Shre & Dostoevsky neither of them satirise. The age of understanding: the age of destroying—& so on.

Belchamber.

A moving, in its way, completed story. But shallow. A superficial book. But also a finished one. Rounded off. Only possible if you keep one inch below; because the people, like Sainty, have to do things without diving: deep; & this runs in the current: which lends itself to completeness. That is, if a writer accepts the conventions, & lets his characters be guided by them, not conflict with them, he can produce an effect of symmetry: very pleasant, suggestive; but only on the surface. That is, I cant care what happens: yet I like the design. Also disgust at the cat monkey psychology, to which he is admirably faithful. A sensitive sincere mind—Howdie, doing his embroidery, & making his acute observations. Not a snob either."
1935.05.08,"Utrecht.

We came back to our grand inn here [Hotel des Pays Bas] a cold day’s drive. We sat & lunched in the car & a funeral passed us. The horse draped in black like a medieval war horse. The plan of a Dutch town is: a bridge a canal: under an arch into a street: pointed, stepped houses; orange & green awnings; 1620: on brand new garages: a great red brick tower, then a vast church, shut up. The caretaker, a respectable rather invalidish man lives opposite. Some frescoes on whitewashed walls. Empty & magnificent. Very Protestant. Flights of cyclists. Immense profusion of highly civilised shops—flower shops, shoes, bicycles, books, everything the more solidly placed wealthy but not frivolous citizen can eat or wear or use: all shining spick & span. English, French German books equal to Dutch. Shops upon shops. People pullulating. Not a beggar, not a slum. Even solid wealth. Angularity. A feeling that Holland is a perfectly self respecting rather hard featured but individual middle aged woman. Conventions of 1913. No women smoking or driving cars. Only one man smokes a pipe in the streets.

Utrecht.

A very cold day. I am (this is copied from pencil notes) sitting in a teashop where 3 Dutch are having horns filled with cream. The nice girl smiles at me. L. is getting letters. (There were none, because of the Jubilee). The two children are eating cakes. Hoolarja, Dutchaboch!—it sounds like that. They dont have tea. A very spick & span shop. They laugh. I pretend to write postcards."
1935.05.09,"Sitting in the sun outside the German Customs. A car with the swastika on the back window has just passed through the barrier into Germany. L. is in the customs. I am nibbling at Aaron’s Rod [by D. H. Lawrence, 1922], Ought I to go in & see what is happening? A fine dry windy morning. The Dutch Customs took 10 seconds. This has taken 10 minutes already. The windows are barred. Here they came out & the grim man laughed at Mitz. But L. said that when a peasant came in & stood with his hat on, the man said This office is like a Church & made him move it. Heil Hitler said the little thin boy opening his bag, perhaps with an apple in it, at the barrier. We become obsequious—delighted that is when the officers smile at Mitzi—the first stoop in our back.

That a work of art means that one part gets strength from another part. At Ulken: home reached late after being turned aside to make way for the Minister President.

By the Rhine, sitting at the window, looking out on the river. The waiter has been talking. He has been in America: democratic; talks as if he were host. Like a little supple monkey. “Let me see now, you like good coffee. What have we nice?” & so on. Also the manager—was in the City Road—wanted to go back & keep a German hostel in Bedford Place. We were chased across the river by Hitler (or Goering) had to pass through ranks of children with red flags. They cheered Mitzi. I raised my hand; People gathering in the sunshine—rather forced like school sports. Banners stretched across the street “The Jew is our enemy” “There is no place for Jews in—”. So we whizzed along until we got out of range of the docile hysterical crowd. Our obsequiousness gradually turning to anger. Nerves rather frayed. A sense of stupid mass feeling masked by good temper. So we came here, Unkel, an old country house, with curved bannister, shallow steps, a black grated stair door, & courtyard. A number of little eyes in the roof, rabbits & doves in outhouses. The innkeeper is playing cards with his wife. They all want to go away—back to Islington, back to Washington—Oh so lovely, said the waiter, who wants to go on talking."
1935.05.12,"Innsbruck

L. says I may now tell the truth, but I have forgotten 2 days of truth, & my pen is weeping ink. Let me see. We went on from the old country house Inn, which ran their charges up high, & drove down the Rhine, & tried to see it as an engaged couple in 1840—no good. An ugly pretentious country—operatic scenery. High, but insignificant hills, bristling with black & green fir trees, with correct towers & ruins—a river that runs with coal barges like Oxford Street; traffic on the cobbled roads: & then a wall had fallen, & we were made to cross over to the right side again. And so to—to where? I begin to forget. The dullest day of them all. But we got to Augsburg; & we had a room with a bath, & then went on, to Heidelberg, which is—yes—a very distinguished University town, on the Neckar. The dons & their daughters were having a musical evening. I saw them tripping out to each others houses with pale blue Beethoven quartets under their arms. Something like the Verralls & the Darwins in old Cambridge—the same dress, & nice intelligent faces. Great rhododendrons blooming. Still hot & blue. And the river like sliding plate glass: And next day to Augsburg—a dull town, but with a bath. A room with a bath. The country steadily improves—becomes shaped & spaced. From Augsburg to Innsbruck where I sit in the empty room—the hotels quite empty, & the town quiet as the grave, & very stately. What did we see today? Great snow hills, with black rifts in them. Torrents. Lakes; one copper green. And it rained for the first time & was cold in the mountains. Fancy living with dirty snow at the door in May! Lovely, but utilitarian, pine woods. Black troops herded together. The Hitler feeling relaxed, though every village had a painted sign “Die Juden sind hier unwunscht”. But this seemed to be put up by authority. Changed into Austria at last; & we are now almost out of earshot."
1935.05.20,"Rome

This is out of its place. Nor can I really flatter myself that I am going to float off the drive home from Cassenlino⁠[Cassino] this evening—the women balancing blue green pots, the hot⁠[?] spring, green, blue & black precipitous mountain, flowers⁠[?], umbrella pines, the town with the perched egg shell houses. And then, globed in the luminous light, for the sunset was pouring gold all over us, St Peters, to which we drove.

Is there any ‘use’ in such notes? Perhaps when the editing of the mind has gone further one can see & select better. Quentin bought an Italian paper & read of Lawrence’s death. Butted into a motorcycle. But I will now use the half hour left before they come to dinner to copy out from the pencil book that I keep in my bag to write it when taking in petrol, waiting for something or other. Again, whats the use, but that parrot cry would stifle most things.

Brenner. Monday 13th. Odd to see the countries change into each other. Beds now made of layers on top. No sheets. Houses becoming Austrian, dignified. Winter lasts at Innsbruck till July. No spring. Italy fronts one on a blue bar. The Cheko Slovaks are in front going to the customs house.

Verona [13 May]. Written after drinking wine. I dont want to wake up. This is the lust that led many astray, but not comparable to my own private excitements. And it wears off so soon, even as I write, reason returns. I can see the world outside. The public: the grey green officer reading the paper. Queer what a part wine has played in human life. Omar [Khayyam] &c. How all impressions are mixed. I am thinking of V.D. 30 years ago: Nessa: my honeymoon: Roger: I looking at Verona from the train. The sensation is of a tight band round the head tingling in the soles of the feet, hotness, & a spring: expanding.

What would the writing of a complete drunkard be?

A Turgenev novel at lunch. The diners cosmopolitan. A woman like Alice Clifford [unidentified] who asked that her ashes might be buried at sea.

Florence [15 May]. Ash coloured houses with green doors. Smell of coffee roasting.

Perugia [15 May]. Came through Florence today—Saw the green & white cathedral. & the yellow Arno dribbling into shallows. A thunderstorm. Irises purple against the clouds. So to Arezzo. A most superb church with dropped hull.

Lake Trasimen. Stood in a field of red purple clover: plovers egg lake, grey olives, exquisite, subtle, sea cold, shell green. So on, regretting that we did not stay, to Perugia—[Hotel] Brufani where we stayed in 1908. Now all the same. The same ardent sunburnt women. But lace & so on for sale. Better to have stayed at Trasimen. I went into an Albergo yesterday to buy rolls & found a sculptured fireplace, all patriarchal—servants & masters. Cauldron on the fire. Probably not much change since 16th century: the people preserve legends. Men & women scything. A nightingale singing where we sat. Little frogs jumping into the stream.

Brufani. Three people watching the door open & shut. Commenting on visitors like fates—summing up, placing. A woman with a hard lined aquiline face—red lips—bird like, perfectly self-satisfied. French, pendulous [word indecipherable]—a rather poor sister. Now they sit nibbling, at human nature. We are rescued by the excellence of our luggage.

Rome. tea. Tea in cafe. Ladies in bright coats & white hats. Music. Look out & see people like movies. Abyssinia. Children begging. Café haunters. Ices. Old man who haunts the Greco.

Sunday cafe. N⁠[essa]. & A⁠[ngelica]. drawing. Very cold. Rome a mitigated but perceptible Sunday. Fierce large jowld old ladies. Q. talking about Monaco. Talleyrand. Some very poor black wispy women. The effect of dowdiness produced by wispy hair. The Prime Ministers letter offering to recommend me for the Companion of honour. No."
1935.05.21,"Oddities of the human brain Woke early & again considered dashing off my book on Professions; to which I had not given a single thought these 7 or 8 days. Why? This vacillates with my novel—how are they both to come out simultaneously. But it is a sign that I must get to pen & paper again. Yet at the moment I am going rag marketing with N. & A—who dont come."
1935.05.26,"[Aix-en-Provence]

We went rag marketing. & suddenly out sprang, to my eyes, the old triumphant Vanessa of early married days. Why? How she would bear off in full sail with Roger Clive & me attendant. We bought pots; & a tea set, which gave her great intense potters delight more than any clothing or jewel.

And then? I’m writing at Aix; on a Sunday evening, with a band playing & stopping, & children shouting, in a too luxurious hotel where the waiters bring one the menu, & I mix my French scandalously with odd scraps of my painfully acquired Italian. Still I can rattle off Gli Indifferenti lying on my bed for pleasure. Oh the loveliness of the land still here & there—for instance that first morning’s drive out of Rome—the sea & the lip of the inviolated land; & the umbrella pines, after Civita Vecchia: then of course all the intense boredom of Genoa & the riviera, with its geraniums & its bouganvilia, & its sense of shoving you between hill & sea & keeping you. there in a bright luxury light without room to turn, so steep the vulture neck hills come down. But we slept at Lerici the first night which does the bay the brimming sea & the green sailing ships & the island & the sparkling fading red & yellow night lamps to perfection. But that kind of perfection no longer makes me feel for my pen—Its too easy. But driving today I was thinking of Roger—Brignolles—Corgés—my word, the olives & the rust red earth, & the flat green & the trees.

But now the band has begun again, & we must go down to dine sumptuously off local trout. Off tomorrow, & home on Friday. But though I’m impatient for my brain to eat again, I can dally out these last days better than sometimes. Why? why? I go on asking myself. And feel I could soon polish off those final scenes [in The Years]: a possible amplification of the first paragraph occurred to me. But I dont want to grind at ‘writing’ too hard. To open my net wide. It occurs to me, as we drive, how I’m disliked, how I’m laughed at; & I’m rather proud of my intention to take the fences gallantly. But writing again!

Nessa you see, is always interrupted by Angelica, who has the social sense & not the contemplative. Goodbye, sweet dreams, she laughed as she waved us away on Thursday night on the Piazza di Spagna. And so she always interrupts & says, Mummy, if you’re going out would you buy me some dark blue cotton. Oh yes. And then we must think about getting hair curlers. So she cant brood over pictures, which must be a divine refreshment. Never mind. I’m dipping into K.M.’s letters, Stendhal on Rome; & the Italian. Cant formulate a phrase for K.M. All I think a little posed & twisted by illness & Murry; but agonised, & at moments that direct flick at the thing seen which was her gift—Then all the old Tchekov stuff about life; & the perpetual rather sordid worries & gibes, & the doll on the bed, which I detest, & something driven & forced to cram into one year the growth of five or six. So I cant judge & get [text ends]"
1935.05.28,"Moulins

And here we are in yet another hotel, this time with a bath. Last night at Vienne. No bath. Water cut off by town. A great bath for common washing supplied by the squash eyed manager. Very good local dinner: crayfish: a comm. travellers hotel, also patronised by lower grade officers, who discuss military tactics & flirt with waitress. Sugar, always sweetened by the hands of a woman; All this taken philosophically by a huge black lady ladling out sour milk. I can still see the last scene—how; soon they rub away—like a knock I gave my shin. All day we drove from Aix in wet straight unbroken rain, mud coloured sky over us, & peasants standing to pick cherries in the rain. Trees all red spotted with cherries—only just visible in the grey downpour. A dull boring day, but got to Vienne at last; & today has been a very good day, coming across country over the wide high hills with [text ends]

I forgot the Casino at Monte Carlo. A bright blue & white day: carved parapets gleaming; little embayed town on the sea. I saw domes & pillars & told L. this was the Casino; so we went in, & had to produce passports, & sign a paper, & give up hat & umbrella, & then paid nothing but went into a florid but dingy hall, set with seven or eight tables, something like great billiard tables, at which sat a dingy sweaty rather sordid crew, with their faces all set & expressionless watching the gold bars sweeping this way & that in the middle. They had something peculiar. One couldnt place them. Some were dingy old governesses in spectacles, others professors with beards; there was one flashy adventuress; but most were small business men—only rather, not very vicious. It was a blazing hot Sunday morning about 12, & this, we thought is the way our culture spends its holidays. Vicious, dull, & outside lurid. So on."
1935.05.29,"[Chartres]

And I begin this sentence on a grey noisy evening might be mid September in Chartres, determined to let a long slide of time pass before I go motoring again. The pane of glass that is pressed firm over the mind in these travels—there I am vitreated on my seat—cant read talk or write—only look I at the endless avenues—plane trees poplars—rain, rain—old man with a cart—ask the mileage—look at map light a cigarette & turn over the old problems—chiefly the same, because I cant start a new one till the cage doors are opened—all this makes the 2 last days as intolerable as the first two are rapturous.

And then it always rains; coming over the high [?] Chartres plain it was almost a fog. At Orleans it was grey as November. Only the thought of getting quiet in ones own chair again makes this racket—I write in the window looking on to a vast bare space—tolerable. But its odd how one longs to uncurl the spring in the brain—to let fly: how insipid life is without—writing is it? Yet this is the best & least distressing of all our tours. I could only have wished 2 days less coming across France.

Its the depression too of the waiters & women behind glass in the hall; But I shall enjoy my dinner. And only one day more—It’ll take a day or two however to scratch off the pane of glass.

And, putting down my pen, I fetched L. & we went to the Cathedral which was almost dark & melodramatic—I mean surprising, there only the arches & shadows showing, we all alone, & the blue windows blazing in the cold grey night. In fact it was like seeing the skeleton & eyes of the cathedral glowing there. Mere bones, & the blue red eyes. The windows are all blue & red, & at one end there’s the jewel burning—the great rose jewel, burning blue in coal blackness, for all the world like something worn upon a vast—what? woman⁠[’s] body wont do. The jewel of the world then—or is that sentimental? After we had sat & looked slowly grayness returned to the thick pillars but still the scooped shadowy look remained. Never had we seen it so bare, so architectural, a statement of proportions, save for the fiery & deep blue glass, for the glass varied from gloomy to transcendent. So back to a first rate dinner—a dinner thought out, & presided over by a graceful young chef, precisely like Raymond, only with greater gift & charm. For instance he concocted a sauce out of cream, French beans, mustard, salt & wine. To add the wine he held his finger which was not clean half over the mouth of the bottle. Then left the sauce to simmer over a spirit lamp: then another red brown casserole was brought, & the sauce poured over. Our dinner was rich & thoughtful: I had mushrooms in cream. And I observed the way a good waiter serves a dish with infinite care & respect, as if handling something precious. Now Chartres is quieter, & so to sleep."
1935.05.31,"[Monks House]

Home again, & how queer, as we drove up there was Pinka’s basket being carried up by Percy, & she had died yesterday: her body was in the basket. Just as we were saying that we would see her in a moment. Percy was very red, very sad, screwed his eyes up, would not smile at us, & then told us. So thats whats bound to happen we said. A very silent breakfast. I had been saying how she would put out my match & all the usual jokes. And the intensity of the sense of death—even for a dog—how odd—our feeling of her character, & the grotesqueness—something pathetic, & the depression, & the I suppose fear of sentimentality & so on.

A cold misting day: Pinka’s feet by the way on my blotting paper. The usual tremor & restlessness after coming back, & nothing to settle to, & some good German woman sends me a pamphlet on me, into which I couldnt resist looking, though nothing so upsets & demoralises as this looking at ones face in the glass. And a German glass produces an extreme diffuseness & complexity so that I cant get either praise or blame but must begin twisting among long words. And so I must write letters. L.’s book is reviewed in the Lit. Sup. on the day it came out & seriously without a sneer, though not with much grasp. Never a bite in that senile paper.

The view as beautiful as any I’ve seen, by the way, even on a mud coloured day. The frost has nipped the fruit, the box hedges have yellow tops. Lady Rhondda asks us to dinner, & so the snake renews its skin. We drove through Normandy yesterday & it was Bank holiday owing to Ascension day, so that all the people were dressed in respectable black coats & fur. A more ugly tribute to the spirit could not be. We lunched on the balcony at Caudebec, & the Bank holiday crowd was lunching too—getting blotched & red in the face: taking out mirrors & rubbing red & white too profusely into lips & noses. An old man next us who had to be hoisted into his car after eating largely I suppose to return to Paris. A long row of cars waiting. Plethoric after their lunch & wine the holiday makers walked up & down looking at each other’s cars. We drove off too, got early to Dieppe, smelt the usual strong smells, gave the car up & settled down to the usual 4 or 5 hours till 10 in the hotel. Mitz provided a long discourse with the wife, daughter & mother—3 generations—in the stuffy little office. The girl was translating Caesar. She must know languages, they said, & was to come to Newhaven to learn English. A great tradition—French talk: I enjoyed the expressiveness of the old woman, describing Englishwomen during the war. She was in a shop, & they didn’t know a word, but soon had the hang of it—saying Pomme, then pomme de terre. Much more style to her than to a woman of her type in Lewes. I am writing to steady the fidgets, to cover over the depression. L. has begun work, & it is only eleven, & I cant take up my book. I think that an hour of reading some good author is prescribed."
1935.06.01,"My excuse for not beginning my book—I mean finishing it—is that I’ve not got the final chapter here. So what shall I do? Read the old one. But that’s fussing & fidgeting. I think wait till Monday & then flash at it, & get it done by August. Holidays are very upsetting. And its cold & grey. And my hand shakes. And I want some regular hours & work. And it’ll take at least a weeks agony to get back into the mood. And I shall slip back by reading about in the book, & dreaming after tea; & perhaps, if nature allows, taking a walk. L. very depressed too, about poor dear Pink. 8 years of a dog certainly mean something. I suppose—is it part of our life thats buried in the orchard? That 8 years in London—our walks—something of our play private life, thats gone? And—odd how the spring of life isn’t to be tapped at will. I cant get into the swim by saying it is Saturday morning & I will write. I cant get into that stream by standing & wishing it. All sorts of habits, of being unconscious of the surface, attentive to other things, have to settle naturally. Coming back one is horribly broken up, notices surfaces. Habit is the desirable thing in writing.

1935.06.05,"Back here again, & the grim wooden feeling that has made me think myself dead since we came back is softening slightly. Its beginning this cursed dry hard empty chapter again in part. Every time I say it will be the devil! but I never believe it. And then the usual depressions come. And I wish for death. But I am now seeing that the last 200 pages will assert themselves, & force me to write a play more or less: all broken up: & I stop to begin making up. Also, after the queer interlude, at once life—that is the telephone beginning—starts. So that one is forcibly chafed. (I meant to make a note about the dramatic shape which forces itself upon me). Vita; Stephen Tennant; Julian; dressmaker; going to Rodmell for Whitsun. Must I go to the Paris Conference? Amabel rings up.

Mrs Woolf yesterday talking admirable racy English. My head ached. The room bare, as she’s going to Worthing. She asked L. to read aloud Miss Daisy Knockends? letter, a daily maid whom Cecil might have married—a decayed wastrel. “But how can one give people up?” She had been to Phil’s show. “And old Queen [Mary] was led about. I enjoyed it immensely.” There were lettuces & radishes for tea, but the people complained it was cold. Babs & Phil without an ounce of flesh on their faces. Such hard work—A Gymkana. And Marie won a prize. And I often ask myself, what have I got out of life? I have brought up good men & women…."
1935.06.06,"There is no doubt that the greatest happiness in the world is walking through Regents Park on a green, but wet—green but red pink & blue evening—the flower beds I mean emerging from the general misty rain—& making up phrases after a little stimulus from little Mr Murray among his clothes. He wants to become a scene maker, to design the decors for Strauss’s ballet. He was trained in the law at Edinburgh, but gave it up because some friends excited him about his designs. And now he’s feeling a little at a dead end, & wants more scope. Why does this serve to start phrases, so that I left my bus, wasted 2d fare, & walked across Regents Park. Not that I’m fluent with my scene this morning; very difficult on the contrary. But Rome holds no greater excitement than this. So that Mabel’s terrible faux pas—she broke the gramophone—& Pinka’s death, are somehow obliterated. After dinner, however, that whining & complaining disreputable egomaniac, the Polish Count, rang up & bickered, discreditably. “I am boycotted by the entire literary world. Why I ask you does the N.S. allude to me as Montalk? Miss Rebecca West is the only writer who calls me Count Potocki—” till L. became very trenchant & weighty & cut him off: but we were exacerbated. And I had a disagreeable letter from a stranger. You of course despise anyone who lives in an Avenue, you who’ve had a book written on your philosophy by a Frenchman. The inferiority complex is thick as a nettle bed. And I cant read Dante after a morning with my novel—too hard."
1935.06.10,"at Monks House. Working very hard. I think I shall rush these scenes off."
1935.06.11,"Yet I cannot write this morning (Tuesday) How can I say, naturally, I have inherited the Rose & the Star!"
1935.06.12,"I am so glad I am not lunching with Rebecca West to meet Miss E. Jenkins; at the same [time] I am so sorry that L. wants to spend 3 days at Monks House every fortnight: from Thursday night till Monday morning.

These are my troubles Mr—as the man said when the footman put on too many coals. And I think I’ve found a bridge in that scene."
1935.06.13,"In some ways, its rather like writing The Waves—these last scenes. I bring my brain to a state of congestion have to stop: go upstairs, run into towsled Mr Brewster; come back; find a little flow of words. Its the extreme condensation: the contrasts: the keeping it all together. Does this mean that its good? I feel I have a round of great pillars to set up, & can only drag & sweat. It’s something like that. Its getting barer & more intense. And then what a relief when I have the upper air scenes—like the one with Eleanor! only they have to be condensed too. Its the proper placing that strains me.

Pannickar & Morgan last night; rather difficult. P. so bubbling, always talking with a smile, swart & greased, like some animal with a thick pelt & very white teeth. Then Morgan, evanescent, piping, elusive, settling exactly there. Had been lunching with Rebecca; giving away prizes. My bones ached—that cold field picnic at Glynde I suppose. And Morgan divined that we would not come to Paris. Always divines the meaning & then flits off. As a matter of fact, P. had stolen 2 books of his. He did not like him. M. has a razor edge to his mind. And he cant get on with “Bloomsbury” & feels, I guess, unattached, & thus takes on public work, which depresses him.

Ought I to go & see R. West? I want to for some reason—partly about fascism. Clive rang up this morning. We dine there tonight. L. says “your” cook! which annoys me. She must go, I suppose.

Then—I will now go on with the F. Queen. & finish it. The mood has come back."
1935.06.15,"We dined with Clive, & I felt very fond of him. He has great sympathy—as when, talking of Adrian, he said, “He gets great pleasure now from his children. When I praised Ann’s looks, he bridled.” Yes, I’m very fond of my old Clive. And Li was charming, genial, affable, urbane. Clive said, I always say youre half cracked (to me). We were saying how many Rogers & Lyttons there are. He said Segonzac thinks Nessa the best painter in England, much better than Duncan. I will not be jealous, but isnt it odd—thinking of gifts in her? I mean when she has everything else. And my head is congested again, & I will not go to Paris, because I should have a weeks misery; & for all my sweating, I’m getting ahead with the P.s; No name suggests itself. Rebecca asks me to dine. The Cecils ask us to dine.

And it is drumming with rain, & we are starting off to Philip’s. This amused me—L.’s complex. “He’s annoyed, thats why he hasnt written.” Finally, he got me to telephone last night, thinking it might be awkward if he bearded Philip who was annoyed. “Virginia? No. I never heard. But we should be delighted to see you” said Philip cordially. So we are off, in this storm.

And Nessa never writes; but why make up stories about one’s relations? An odd family complex."
1935.06.16,"So we drove to Winchendon through the rain. I was very numb in the head by the way & saw things at a great distance, which explains the bemused state, no impact, of my impressions. London spreads about 17 miles this way, suddently stops outside Rickmansworth at Moor Park, as if some great Lord still kept an estate. Then Amersham, with the house [market hall] in the middle, rather like a peasant version of an Italian town; then a few bushyheaded woods; but always houses. At last we came to the gate, & there on the left in the green watery light were the children riding on copper coloured horses, going round under the trees; & Babs & Phil. And the talk began. They had found Cardinal Wolsey’s arms in a rubbish heap: had them mounted into a mantelpiece. But it was badly done by the local stonemason: the fruit carving injured. Tea. Proper maid. Children drinking out of Jubilee mugs. “We each have two” said Pippin who looks up under her eyes. Mary a straightnosed child Cecil sloping nosed. Talk about the great Gymkhana. P⁠[hilip]. netted £500. All the stalls had paid. 7000 for tea. And so on. Babs has yellow front teeth; wears horn glasses. Then we walked past the wicked Lords house. But I dont like parks. And B. talked of horses; used to break them in, teach riding; loves horses; used to teach boys, running beside them; filled all pigsties & hutches with horses. Riding now a passion: all Woolworth girls ride before breakfast, have 2/- rides. This very hard on the horses. The man next them hired 20 hunters; hunting on the hire system. One goes lame, is sent back, another supplied by Smiths. Laughed at George & Flora: child not allowed to eat ices; won’t talk, spoilt; family gossip: all quite running, free, what I call ‘natural living’. P. walked ahead & talked politics with L. Children tipped. Asparagus given, & so home: dine at 8.30: & I slept all the evening over the fire, & dreamt of cutting my hand in a theatre, & of a professional mistress of ceremonies who had to entertain people; & somehow Mrs Clifford came in; & I woke to find L. standing over me. And I have scrambled along this morning: & tonight we dine with Rhondda; but I am not going to Paris."
1935.06.18,"Yesterday, instead of reading Tom’s Murder in the Cathedral, which, having run through & tested my colour sense, I expect to be good, I had to give Ralph Brewster tea. Curious teeth; gooseberry coloured staring eyes; & an air of nervous instability. Large hands, hanging: only just neat enough to have tea. A sudden amused kindling in the gooseberry eyes; & the profuse storytelling of those who have lived with savages. Would go on & on & on."
1935.06.20,"I am so oppressed by the thought of all the books I have to write that my head is like a bursting boiler. Half an hour ago, Margery Fry rang up to ask me to open an Ex⁠[hibitio]⁠n of Roger’s paintings at Bristol; to speak for 15 minutes. Oh we should all love it! she said. Then it appeared that they are counting on me to write a life. She is collecting papers. This morning theres a book (in the Lit. Sup.) complaining that women have dropped their sacred task. This floods me with my Professions book. Helen tells me that the Stracheys are hurt that I never offered to write about Lytton. “But I wanted to & they never asked me!” I said. Oh but they didn’t like to suggest it—James says they do want it. And here I am wedged—no, buoyant—in a floating storm of scenes at the end of my book, which must be compacted & pulled out & turned & (this comes from my hair waving yesterday—from 2 to 4.45 & rather successful). And we are incessantly asked to dine lunch & ‘see’ people.

Tom last night: supple & sub⁠[t]⁠le, simple & charming. Stayed till 12.15. I never felt so much at my ease. He is a dear old fellow: one of ‘us’: odd: I felt I liked him as I liked Lytton & Roger—with intimacy in spite of God. First we talked of his play. He stayed with Lady Raleigh, & she gave him cocoa & Oliver biscuits but never said a word about the play. There was a canon there. And they looked out of the window & saw 3 girls in very short shorts, naked legs & large bottoms go into the Cathedral. ‘‘The dean encourages them” said Lady R. grimly. “I am in favour of St. Paul if one must be irrational” said Tom. Now tell me about the marmozets view of Germany.” We made a good dinner. And he said he liked Stephen—“What a charming person in many ways” no, I think he didnt even qualify his remark, so kind has he become. “Auden is a very nice rattled brained boy. Some of his plays extremely good, but its superficial: stock figures; sort of Punch figures…” Publishers gossip. A story about a party to entertain the Reads, Ludo & her sister & German friend. Tom bought fireworks; sugar that dissolved & let out small fish; & chocolates that he thought were full of sawdust. “Theyre very greedy,” he said; “And by a mistake the chocolates were full of soap. They set on me…. And it was not a success. So much so that I forgot the fireworks, until they were going. I then let them off on the doorstep. And poor Herbert had to pay for a cab from Bina Gardens to Hampstead.” This was very amusing, & not as stiff as usual. L. made cigarettes. Tom drank whisky. I mused & was at my ease. Tom wants to give me all his works, but thought I didnt read them—would always have given me all his works."
1935.06.22,"The Bees are swarming this week end, & Percy goes about in flannel trousers with a net over his head, very self important. “I’m going to get a friend to help me tonight, & we shall cut out the Queens” he’s just said.

It has suddenly become full summer: droning, misting, with birds & bees. The cuckoo calling in the elm tree at 3 or 4 this morning so that I had to stop my ears. The heat came suddenly as we walked by the river on Friday. And the field in front is red with something that [farmer] Botten’s growing in his bog. Wehad mushrooms—people come out at 4 or 5 to pick them. Instead of surveying all this in a torpid swoon of pleasure, illustrated by scenes from my book, Mrs W. & Harold came to tea; she stumbled on the doorstep & turned her ankle. Then there were figures passing the window—Jack & Jeremy: whereupon she lost all interest in life, poor old lady, thinking that no one would listen to her family stories. She cannot stretch to take in any stranger. But, after saying that the garden was the best they had ever seen, they went on to the [Glyndebourne] opera. Monty Shearman was strolling, all in black, outside .. Harold Mrs W. & I continued our rather burbling conversation: about highbrows, & then about Maids, & the hotel. I heard all about L.’s father, & how he did not take silk till he was 45, & made his name over—I forget what case; so it comes over & over again, the story of her life, with the usual comments. “And I ask myself, what for? And I am now so lonely. I have lived alone so many years now…” which, I mechanically turn off upon Bella: who is now Queen of Hong Kong. She is very ambitious. And so wonderfully tactful. And so popular. What dress did she wear? A beautiful white taffeta. Tom [Southorn, her husband] was so generous—He gave her some money to spend on clothes. She has to have so many. In the old days she did not mind how she dressed. So we droned, sitting on the terrace before, this house—very successful as a sitting place on a hot day.

Why does this talk smear my mind so that I cant settle in at 6.30 to do anything but march up & down the terrace? Poor old lady. She has shrunk slightly, carries some animal with a white belly, & white gloves. Harold brings his horse down on a trailer & rides on the downs. The horse is fed by an automatic feeder invented by himself. He has given up his yatcht, as Alice [his wife] dislikes it. L. buying newspapers was told by the newsagent the story of Miss Wightman. She wears her fathers mackintosh & nothing underneath. It is getting old, & coming to bits. She is a poet, & has won a medal from the King which she keeps in a red morocco case, & the newsagent has seen it."
1935.06.25,"A curious & rather unpleasant scene with Mabel. She was in tears, because Mr Woolf never believes a word she says. And I think its true. L. is very hard on people; especially on the servant class. No sympathy with them; exacting; despotic. So I told him yesterday, when he’d complained about the coffee. “If I maynt even say when the coffee is bad &c”. His extreme rigidity of mind surprises me; I mean in its relation to others: his severity: not to myself but then I get up & curse him. What does it come from? Not being a gentleman partly: uneasiness in the presence of the lower classes: always suspects them, is never genial with them. Philip & Edgar [Woolf] are the same. His desire, I suppose, to dominate. Love of power. And then he writes against it. All this I shall tell him again, for it doesnt matter, to me; in our relationship; & yet I hate people; noticing it: Nessa; Dadie; even Kingsley Martin—who all admire & respect him. An interesting study. It goes with great justice, in some ways; & simplicity too; & doing good things: but it is in private a very difficult characteristic. I must now get rid of Mabel, & find another. This row has precipitated it & given me a good excuse for sacking her: but I feel its unfair on her."
1935.06.27,"A good thing for old Bloomsbury to be shaken up no doubt: a good thing to dine with R. West & Mr Andrews [her husband] last night in their flat in P⁠[ortman]. Sqre. with the view, with the £750 book case, & the fish carved out of a yew branch, & the modern pictures, period furniture letter box in the wall & which dont work (nor did Arnold Bennett’s—you have to poke with a stick). But the electric light in the coat cupboard does work. And what’s wrong? The plumbers nose—the miner’s canary, again. I mean scenting out differences, & let us hope inferiorities. Of course its admirable in its way—impersonal, breezy, yes, go ahead, facing life, eating dinner at Savoy, meeting millionaires, woman & man of the worldly; but—no, I must add the kindness intelligence & erudition of the admirable effete spectacled swollen eyed Andrews—the cultivated don turned banker, with his devotion to R.—Cecily he calls her, for whom he buys these fish & bookcases. Whats wrong then? Where does the gas escape? I think its the emptiness, the formality, the social strata they live on—appearances, as the Apostles would say: the sense of Now we’re having a dinner party & must talk till 11: tomorrow another. Hospitality to American publisher & the Woolves. Nothing said of any naturalness or spontaneity. Yet thats not quite so; that one cd. go on having dinner every night & never know each other better. No intimacy at the end of that Oxford Street. And I was a little diminished in my own esteem—why? Because .. did they differentiate me from other people? No. Or Leonard? But then isnt this Bloomsbury conceit—our d-d refinement? I went on the roof with Andrews & saw all London—a magnificent metropolis so brushed lip, so ornate, so continental & cosmopolitan at night in that quarter: there’s Oxford Street, theres Hyde Park, thats the new Lyons block of flats. And the West End squares; & oblongs of white light, & yellow light the faces, the rouged faces of offices & steeples & cranes; all very impressive; very soigne, like Mr Ginsburg’s little sharp face: so radiant—& I so blown about, I suppose⁠[?]. Graham came, a little fuddled: had drunk too much I think; made heavy weather with R. She has great vitality: is a broad browed very vigorous, undistinguished woman: but a buffeter & battler: has taken the waves, I suppose; & can talk in any language: why then this sense of her being a lit up modern block, floodlit by electricity?"
1935.06.28,"But dinner with the [David] Cecils last night was very good: free & spontaneous; they were all dressed for a party at the Herberts: Origo was there, whom I like. She is young, tremulous, nervous—very—stammers a little—but honest eyed; very blue eyed. Have I already described her? How she came to tea. Anyhow, shes clean & picks her feet up. Talk spurted. (I hope I did not try to be brilliant?) Rachel very diaphanous, simple, erratic, with Molly’s look, some of Desmond’s humour. David growing domed & bald; his hair ruffled. We talked about: fear of people; parties; they were all afraid; Sitwell’s lunch; Osbert such a nervous host; the gilt dolphin: rank; up in the drawing room, Origo (her name is Iris) sat down on purpose I think by me, & oh dear was it for this I got so free & easy?—she has read my books, & was of course full of stumbling enthusiasm; so I made a rush, & talked about writing, spilling out ideas, of a kind. She lives near Siena, in perfect country; they talk of the seasons; harvest; vintage; share with peasants; have a great vintage feast off goose. And we talked about: biography & fiction; but with David pricking up his ears across the room. So he had to be drawn in; & I think we have said the same things before—about the relevant facts; biography as an art. Then the door opened & in came Leo Myers, like a du Maurier drawing; such a perfect white waistcoat, (I had not changed—oh dear, when I have such nice clothes now) & his grizzled distinguished head. But he still looks like a sleepy viper. Well then we talked about novels; & could one write down thoughts for a whole day? He had done this & torn it up. He does not keep a notebook. What shall we do about our biographies? Can one report talk? Fear. He is always afraid. And Origo was silent for half an hour, because of going to the party. But she would lose her fear after the entry was over. Leo will be unhappy the next morning. Why does one do these things? Because this is life, after all. One has to. In the street David said that LM is in love with Iris. Thats why he had come. The sleepy viper in his white waistcoat.

L.’s book selling now; & he is cheerful, & very contrite, in his way, about Mabel. Here he comes in about the question of Ethel writing an introduction to Brewster’s book. And Vita writes that Gwen has to have a terrible operation. And Nessa does not write. And after thunder & heat & cold it is hot again; and in an access of generosity we have lent Monks House to Stephen Tennant, & thank God we are alone this week end."
1935.06.30,"We went to Swakeleys Farm [Ickenham] yesterday & bought a dog—Sally. She has a fine domed head; is like a three of black diamonds very globular eyes; a bloodhounds muzzle; very affectionate, stipple, 13 months old, clasps L.’s breast, climbs on to his chair, & is afraid of the basement stairs. She cost £18—dear me. Still as we say, its nice to have a good dog. And we shall breed from her. She is very distinguished looking. The only question is, has she intelligence? She has already her own rather gentle whimsical manner—fumbles, paws; is lighter, more nervous, perhaps less solid a character than Pinka. But so far she has no marked fault, unless she is perhaps fastidious about her food. Had her nose been the 18th of an inch longer, she would have been a champion like her sister, who fetched £2, or £300.

Mr Lloyd is a great expert. He lives in a trim villa residence, that is, in fact an old farm; has 1701 on the chimney. But the room where we waited was completely modernised: with all the cups & bowls, cigar cases, engraved with tributes, in what are called perhaps chiffoniers. He has made a very snug place for himself out of the passion for cockers. “A very nice little person” he said. So did the Kennel man. They have their own language. It was broiling hot, & the garden paved with sham crazy paving: all the image of a garden."
1935.07.04,"Well of course its extremely interesting having to deal with so many different selves. Theres the one that enjoys external life. Will she now insist upon my enjoying external life—the mild fluent chatter of the Buchans? Yes, I did enjoy it. I liked the simplicity the swiftness, the release, the expansion. And L. says “They spend their money getting on—thats why they⁠[re] Governor Generals” & I think thats not true. But how queer to have so many selves—how bewildering!"
1935.07.15,"I have let the days slip I see, a good thing no doubt, as this book is too full; but I have left out a good many encounters; my visit to the Buchans, a strenuous day, which left me raddled; & we went to Monks House, where, as I have not noted, Stephen Tennant was planted; & came & talked, Happily gone to Piddinghoe, though; & I slept; then there was the heat wave—still indomitably with us; & then Odette & Clive & the Brehans—she [Odette] a Paris tart, with eyebrows elongated like antennae, to give her the likeness of a bird in flight, she being all for speed & vengeance & venom & vice—not a woman I like; & Clive sparred, nor did she like meeting anyone who knew her ways. Gerald to me grown commonplace & dried, like one of those hams or tongues that hang in country grocers shops: always, too, uneasily reverting to his book, which was only by way of lesson & trial; indeed he spent, some time reading up facts about rogues in the Brit. Mus. But it is fatal to try to excuse one’s works. His wife is a rather faded but L. says very nice, genuine & simple, American; & they go back to their lovely Malaga house, where Gerald has, as he rather ostentatiously intimated, his illegitimate children. There, in an English Colony, they can live patriarchally on £100 a year; & he can for ever turn & fumble over his books; looking, poor man, with those obstinate little eyes, for the right word. But it was a jangled evening, during which, by the way, round the corner at the Bussys, Frances Partridge gave birth to a son; or rather had him cut out: & all went well.

All this time the Bristol speech was weighing on me, and making me unable to get into my swing for the last lap: so I shut down, wrote it, learnt it, said it & went to Bristol, the hottest day of the year on Friday & said it, dripping, to a large, but not I think very appropriate audience. It puzzles me why such displays, using up so much nerve power, should be needed. There was Roger’s face on the canvas, smiling at me, & them. But oh the heavenly relief when we drove off in the hot evening to Bradford on Avon, & slept the night in an ancient workhouse; in the valley [the Old Court Hotel]; with a disordered garden, a stream with rotting sacks of old clothes, & the usual elderly ladies, retired business men, spaniels, bustling landladies & so on. And then, with a divine inspiration, we made across Avebury to Lechlade; went to Fairford & found the Carnival braying outside the church with the painted windows, had tea ad. lib: the milk in enamel jugs, the sugar in zinc bath tubs; under the trees; then slept at Lechlade, walked by the river, saw the moon rise, like a rose petal, & yesterday drove to Kelmscot & peeped over the wall. In this country everything is made of silver grey flaky stone, & the houses cluster round, with their little gables, all crowded, ancient, with roses, with haystacks, & the river flowing in the great grass meadows, all untouched, beyond the builders ring, which begins at Abingdon, & then till London all becomes red brick Georgian; & Riverine, that is gramo-phontic, girls in trousers, young men in shorts, all noisy & strident & a little indecent—a bad lunch at the Quarry Hotel [Bourne End], & so home here.

Nor must I forget Mr Ellis Roberts, not that he is attractive, an inky little podgy underworld man, who came to ask me to be president of the PEN in succession to Wells. This great honour, unanimously offered with Priestly enthusiastic, would involve meeting authors, for which purpose apparently it exists—that authors should meet & discuss each others works. With E.R. in front of me—but no: how could anyone invent such a post, how could anyone accept it? He pretended, poor worm, to feel as I did; which was a lie.

And now, with a brain washed cool & rid of that intolerable speech, I must dream myself back in to my own world—rather a touch & go proceeding: but its no use getting worried; the end must come. & whether its good or bad, Heaven knows."
1935.07.16,"A curious sense of complete failure. Margery hasn’t written to me about my speech: according to Janie Pamela thought the whole thing a failure. And it was for this that I ruined my last pages! I cant write this morning. Cant get into the swing. Innumerable worries, about getting people to dine & so on, afflict me. My head is all jangled. And I have to get that d—d speech printed, or refuse to. The director has written. Never again, oh never again!

I think though that I can get the last pages right, if I can only dream myself back into them. Yes, but how dream, when I have to see Susie & Ethel, to see Miss Belsher’s house, to ring up, & write notes & order this & that? Well, be still & ruminate; its only 16th: theres a fortnight before August. And I’m sure that there is a remarkable shape somewhere concealed there. Its not mere verbiage, I think. If necessary I could put it away. But I think no: merely go on & perhaps write a very rapid short sketch, in ink—thats a good plan. Go back & get the central idea, & then rocket into it. And be very controlled, & keep a hand on myself too. And perhaps read a little Shakespeare. Yes, one of the last plays: I think I will do that, so as to loosen my muscles. But oh this anxiety, & the perpetual knocking of the cup out of my hand."
1935.07.17,"Last night as I was sitting alone, L. dining with the [Noel-]⁠Bakers, there were three rings, & I went down & let in Julian, who said “I have been given a professorship in China.” He was very much excited, rather alarmed, naturally—it means that he must start in the middle of August & spend 3 years in China at Wu Jong, or some such place, alone on a flooded river. So we talked—intimately, I mean about the past & our lives, for the first time. I’m very sorry he’s to go—the delightful, honest bubbly yet after all so sympathetic & trusty young man. Still, obviously this is his first real experience. He had to break off to answer a trunk call from Tony. He said she spoke with almost too much common sense. But he had always determined not to let his private life shackle him. Then he will travel about China in his holidays, & come back a full grown mature man, with a place in the world. He wants to write on politics & philosophy & to enter politics seriously. He says politics have got more & more on his conscience. They’re on the conscience of all his generation. So he can’t be merely a poet, a writer. I see his dilemma. So he goes, & I’m sorry. Three years. He will be thirty & I 56 alas.

Just now I finished my first wild retyping & find the book comes to 740 pages: that is 174,890 148,000 words: but L think I can shorten: all the last part is still rudimentary & wants shaping; but I’m too tired in the head to do it seriously this moment. I think all the same I can reduce it: & then—? Dear me. I see why I fled, after The Waves, to Flush; One wants simply to sit on a bank & throw stones. I want also to read with a free mind; And to let the wrinkles smooth themselves out. Susie Buchan, Ethel, then Julian—so I talked from 4.30 till 1 am with only 2 hours for dinner & silence.

I think I see that the last chapter slid, be formed round N⁠[orth]’s speech: it must be much more formal; & I think I see how I can bring in interludes—I mean spaces of silence, & poetry & contrast."
1935.07.19,"No. I go on getting preliminary headaches. It is no good trying to do the last spurt, which should be much like a breeze in the heavy elms, these last days here: yes, a wind blowing in the trees that are thick with green leaves. For there must be movement as well as some weight, something for the breeze to lift. And we have Edith [Sitwell] & Eddie Playfair, & Ottoline & Julian & Quentin tonight.

Yesterday we went to tea with Mr & Mrs Standgroom. Coming out we said, no, L. had the technical phrase—but I cant remember it—that they have the world they want. Bedroom suites are made for them; all Tot. Court Road is theirs; the world is to their liking. And gramophones & cases of cutlery & table centres. All this they have & enjoy, genuinely, without any shyness. Standgroom is a wizened parched little man, under her thumb, a clerk in the Customs, who deals with tea. I thought them rather engaging, so pleased with having what everyone has. And Miss B. as she wishes to be called, is quite on top of the situation. Patted my shoulder. No snobbishness. No sense of class differences. And science has helped them to electric toasters: I mean their life materially is much freer & easier than ours at Hyde Park Gate. The only room she did not show us was the W.C. We saw her wedding dress—a pale pink. She does not mean to have children."
1935.07.20,"But it turned out very well last night: headache lifted—we walked in Regents Park in the rain. Old Edith singular—very, with her great bald face—its sweep of rather repulsive brown—its shock of red hair. So beautiful in some lights; & the thin fan shaped hands & their gestures, timid, appealing, attached to this large fat clumsy body in its black rather sack like dress. She has great wit & some sharp edge of character. Quite decided. Knows her mind. She made us laugh all dinner, talking about W. Lewis, who used to paint her, letting her in, at a chink of the door. Who have you been seeing? Clive Bell? And he wore a patch over one eye; switched it on to another, as he disliked the light. She has a gay rambling butterfly mind; & a good deal of sting. & humanity. In came Ottoline; rather garish, & not so quick in the mind as the rest of us. Eddie a very good listener. Then Julian, with his poems, & Quentin. It was all demonstration on Edith’s part, done for our amusement very difficult to recapture. And something drenched & feeble. She has to get up at 7 to write about Queen Victoria at the bidding of Dick le Mare, who is a magician. Something yielding about her, humble, & yet a lady of quality. “The horrid middle class way” said Ott. Edith echoed her. Looks like a Plantagenet tomb said Ott. So she does, with her high nose, in the air, & her thin lips & her little peering eyes—very medieval. Ottoline said you couldnt read Sh⁠[akespea]⁠re in India—too remote."
1935.08.03,"With that remark of Ott’s about not reading Shre in India I broke off my London summer abruptly; though it chattered itself out in great style with a dinner to John [Lehmann]—a reconciliation dinner—& the Busseys, at which he laughed so loud & free that my restraint went; & I talked French to Simon, & went round to the Bussys & saw Clive like a white robin redbreast, all got up going to a party at the Courtaulds: but I do it very seldom, he said in a huff, when Simon chaffed him. “Mon cher—vous etes arrivé.”

So the summer ended; & now opens again here, with Nessa back; Charleston in being, though rather intermittent, with Duncan in Rome still, Clive going to Greece, Julian to China, & Nessa proposing to paint the Queen Mary in London. And the harvest is positively orange on the hill, & the country divinely coloured ripe ashcoloured & gold, as I came through Tristram’s Grove up the river.

Nessa came about a cable to China; & we called in at Charleston to suggest—what its no use foraging in my rather dissipated mind to find. For, by way of a jaunt from the book—the unchristened book—I took a flight into Marryat this—& here I broke off, to go & dredge the pond I think."
1935.08.16,"I cannot make a single note here, because I am so terrifically pressed re-writing—yes, typing out again at the rate, if possible, of 100 pages a week, this impossible eternal book. I work without looking up till one: what it now is, & therefore I must go in, leaving a whole heap of things unsaid: so many people, so many scenes, & beauty, & a fox & sudden ideas."
1935.08.21,"Up in London yesterday. And I saw this about myself in a book [untraced] at the Times—the most patient & conscientious of artists—which I think is true, considering how I slave at every word of that book. My head is like a like a—pudding, is it—something that mildly throbs & cant breed a word at the end of the morning. I begin fresh enough. And I sent off the first 20 pages or so to Mabel [typist] yesterday.

Margery Fry comes on Friday with her hands full of papers, she says. Another book. Have I the indomitable courage to start on another? Think of the writing & re-writing. Also there will be joys & ecstasies though. Again very hot. I am going to re-paint this room. Went to Carpenters [untraced] yesterday—chose chintzes. Is this worth writing? Perhaps.

Harvest all ready. Blackberries ripe. No mushrooms. Abyssinia. Cabinet summoned. Sitting today. Should I like to be old Baldwin? returning from Aix in this heat. L. has indigestion. Mitz spent the night on the free. Janie left the door open. We have our electric stove."
1935.08.22,"Worked in the morning. Finished Marryat. Went to Lewes, very hot day; & bought stores, also distemper. And went to the County Library; full of books. So hot after tea: walked along the river bank; a game of bowls; beaten; dined with Keynes’s. Maynard not well—rather damp talk. He went. Talk of Abyssinia. Thunderstorm at 3.30. L. made me come & sleep in the upstairs room. It strikes me that I will call this book, Other People’s Houses."
1935.08.29,"I had meant to write one matter of fact note daily, but have never had time. My brain all tossing after the mornings work. Julian is leaving Newhaven at this moment I suppose for 3 years. I have been doing the scene of Eleanor’s day with the usual pangs & ecstasies. On Tuesday we went to Sissinghurst; lost L.’s spectacles, & the meat on the top of the car. Saw the great new room. Vita in trousers. Rather woke my affection & regret. Harold gave me Mrs Lindbergh’s book. Woke my insensate obsession—to write P & P—by telling me how a room of ones own is regarded & my American fame. The big Alsatian hunting; the pink tower & the rain on the leaves, L. said, falling as he had not heard it since Ceylon. To dine at Charleston. Julian a little depressed. Duncan laughing about Lady Blanche—his name for G. St Aubyn. Grouse. Nessa composed. Quentin in bed with throat. I very sleepy. Kissed J. in the dark garden. We think of going to China, at any rate think so, to mitigate the parting. Yesterday very drowsy. Walked the Tristram Grove & river walk. L. came to meet me & missed me. Louie’s child attacked by dog. Took it to Lewes. Mr Hancock brought in with injured leg. Very bad. Bach at night; Man playing oboe fainted in the middle. War seems inevitable. I won one game of bowls out of 3. Reading Miss Mole, Abbé Dunnet (good), an occasional bite at Hind & Panther, but brain too expanded. Oh to be done with the book & my own mistress again. Piles of Roger’s papers sent by Margery—a whole box. I have now 3 large boxes, but dare not look in, & am terribly obsessed by P. & P."
1935.08.30,"For a wonder, my head is clear, & my hand does not shake; but then I’ve been doing the Law Courts passage, which went easily: an upper air passage. Now the book seems to me very good.

Last night they sung the Belgian anthem at the Prom: out of respect for the Queen: & after that, the news-reader announced, in his most penetrated with respectful sorrow voice, the death of the Queen in a motor accident. The car ran off the road into a tree, & she was flung out; struck her head. The King kissed her, as she died “& as I could not do anything, I went on” says the most trustworthy observer, a passer by, this morning. That, in its way is a tragedy. Mr Baird [Rodmell resident] had a fit after having tea at Southease. I distempered—the colour is too blue, but better than the green; then we walked to the river, played bowls, & now expect, alas, as I’m in the swim, a teaparty of the most ferocious description, & its a blowing rainy cold day too; the Wolves, Hugh Jones, Angelica & Eve. Not much pleasure to be had, & a tired brain tomorrow; but as I often say—what do I often say? Something to the effect that one must sweep it all up in one’s stride, even as a matter of art. Could I be alone, & write & walk & read, perhaps—but no, I admit the thought at the moment has nothing but heavenly delight in it. As it is, off to Lewes, buying cakes; arrange the room; put the kettle on, & say to Mrs W. Mind the steps."
1935.08.31,"Only the Wolves came however. Torrents & floods & rain & wind. Edgar [Woolf] like a corpse—not a pleasant one either. Yawned behind his hand. Sylvia nervous, cat faced, making conversation. Chiefly about gold fish dogs & cars. L. valiant: I did my usual owl with Mrs W. & she said, as my reward, there was no talk she enjoyed more. Went to Lewes first, in the flood, without a rain coat; went to Helen Boyd, two nervous twittering spinsters in a panelled room, about servants: want a 3 day a week girl. Called at Mount Street. Olivers out. Hugh Jones waited an hour at Southease; went home. Angelica did not come. Mercifully, as the party was damp & dismal, sitting till 6.30 in the dining room. How it rains, said Mrs W. The tap had overflowed: the window a ripple of water. Read Hind & Panther. D.H.L. by E. (good) & slept.

Everybody talking about Abysinnia, wh. I cannot spell, nor can I form letters, though the morning has been fluent—E. & Parnell [The Years, p. 120]—too fluent. A blowing grey day, laden with water."
1935.09.04,"The most critical day since Aug 4th 1914. So the papers say. In London yesterday. Writings chalked up all over the walls. “Dont fight for foreigners. Briton should mind her own business.” Then a circle with a symbol in it. Fascist propaganda, L. said. Mosley again active. The Queen of B’s funeral. Flags at half mast. Bought an umbrella for 25/-. The first And I think I will call the book “The Years” good umbrella I’ve had for years. Man on the bus saw it was new, with a tassel.

L. saw Miss Swinstead Smith, a very nervous, nice, odd shabby woman, youngish; her first book; Constables almost published it but cried off on commercial grounds. We are going to do it though. She lives at Sennen in a cottage rent £12 a year. I went to L⁠[eiceste]⁠r. Sqre & bought silk for nightgown. Mabel at the flat, very competent. Hot, windy. Home to grouse early. Now pouring. Letter from Denny, a silly gushing letter, has a son. Nature. She writes worse than she talks. Perhaps its writing to me. And Queenie Leavis also writes, a priggish letter, drawing attention to Life as we have known it, in that prigs manual, Scrutiny. All they can do is to schoolmaster.

Oh how it pours! I used my umbrella for the first time to cross the garden. Cant write today. I suppose after yesterday. Nessa in London. We saw a snake eating a toad: it had half the toad in, half out; gave a suck now & then. The toad slowly disappearing. L. poked its tail; the snake was sick of the crushed toad, & I dreamt of men committing suicide & cd. see the body shooting through the water."
1935.09.05,"I’ve had to give up writing The Years—thats what its to be called—this morning. Absolutely floored. Sally in bed. Cant pump up a word. Yet I can see, just, that somethings there; so I shall wait, a day or two, & let the well fill. It has to be damned deep this time—740 pages in it. I think, psychologically, this is the oddest of my adventures. Half my brain dries completely; but I’ve only to turn over, & there’s the other half, I think, ready, quite happily to write a little article. Oh if only anyone knew anything about the brain. And, even today, when I’m desperate, almost in tears looking at the chapter, unable to add to it, I feel I’ve only got to fumble & find the end of the ball of string—some start off place, someone to look at Sara perhaps—no, I dont know—& my head would fill & the tiredness go. But I’ve been waking & worrying. Bothered about Li’s indigestion & his loss of weight, with the apple picking & the Cttee meeting autumn coming on.

A very sensational voice on the loudspeaker last night. M⁠[ussolini]. closes the door. Deep disappointment. What next? &c. But the papers this morning are less melodramatic, & incline to think that the affair will drag on undecided for some time. I was also in a stew about war & patriotism last night. And when it comes to my thinking about my country! Thank God, John Bailey’s life is out, & I shall seek consolation there. And write about Mrs Lindbergh?"
1935.09.06,"I am going to wrap my brain in green dock leaves for a few days: 5, if I can hold out; till the children, L.’s nieces, have gone. If I can—for I think a scene is forming. Why not make an easier transition: Maggie looking at the Serpentine say; & so avoid that abrupt spring? Isn’t it odd that this was the scene I had almost a fit to prevent myself writing? This will be the most exciting thing I ever wrote, I kept saying. And now its the stumbling block. I wonder why? too personal, is that it? Out of key? But I wont think. A flutter & clutter of engagements: Nessa; Stephen [Tennant], Ethel, then the children; & L., as I know, is very touchy, dear love, about his family: an inferiority complex, I call it, thinking how much more vigorous & interesting my relations are: missing Julian; yes. Still whats odd is how nice people are: children always. So there’s no great harm done if I have to give up 48 hours.

Hugh, like Pipsy about the nose & eyes, Ang⁠[e]⁠l⁠[ica] & Eve & Q. to tea yesterday. Bowls & archery. Into Lewes, shopping, which I dislike. Got Mrs Thompsett to come: Sandy clear skinned; was distempering kitchen, bright green; rather a good colour. I must get Rosie to make my curtains. Reading. Miss Mole: fair, but soft; & Stella Benson but I’m hard on novels, & an old dr. called Salter, & Dryden, & Alfieri. How soon one gets the hang of a written language! My gift I think—the shape of the sentence. Violent wind & rain; violent sun & light; & they go on talking, threatening, advancing & retreating at Geneva. Look how clear my hand is when I don’t write fiction of a morning. Head cool now at 1 instead of parboiled."
1935.09.07,"A heavenly quiet morning reading Alfieri by the open window & not smoking. I believe one could get back to the old rapture of reading if one did not write. The difficulty is, writing makes one⁠[’s] brain so hot it cant settle to read; & then when the heat goes, I’m so tired in the head, I can only skirmish. But I’ve stopped 2 days now The Years: & feel the power to settle calmly & firmly on books coming back at once. John Bailey’s life, come today, makes me doubt though—what? Everything. Sounds like a mouse squeaking under a mattress. But I’ve only just glanced & got the smell of Lit. dinner, Lit. Sup, Lit this that & the other—& the one remark to the effect that Virginia Woolf of all people, has been given Cowper by Desmond, & likes it! I, who read Cowper when I was 15—d—d nonsense."
1935.09.10,"A not so heavenly morning. Children staying here. Chill. L. in a stew about Stephen [Tennant]—that is he wants to come: why have S. 3 times & not Kingsley Martin. A very old, sorry, but not serious story. And yet how foolish to have even these disagreements; & yet I suppose how inevitable—magnets which draw other little straws along. Can I read, write or think though, going for a picnic, & the children—nice lively undistinguished brats—shooting. Yet how quick & hard & unexpected childrens minds are. Everything within 10 miles seen exactly; their school; the maid who’s in love with the gardener; a solicitor not so good as a barrister: the rank of the girls fathers: the whole of society in one drop."
1935.09.12,"Mornings which are neither quiet nor heavenly, but mixed of hell & ecstasy: never have I had such a hot balloon in my head as re-writing The Years; because its so long; & the pressure is so terrific. But I will use all my art to keep my head sane. I will stop writing at 11.30 & read Italian or Dryden and so dandle myself along.

To Ethel at Miss Hudson’s yesterday. As I sat in the complete English Gentleman’s home, I wondered how anybody could tolerate that equipage; & thought how a house should be portable like a snail shell. In future perhaps people will flirt out houses like little fans; & go on. There’ll be no settled life within walls. There were endless clean, well repaired rooms. A maid in a cap. Cakes on pagoda trays. A terrible array of glossy brown furniture, & books—red sham leather. Many nice old rooms, but the manor house has been embellished & made of course selfconsciously elaborate. A ball room: a library—empty. And Miss Hudson all brushed up with her Pekinese, a competent ex mayor of Eastbourne, with waved grey hair, & all so neat & stout, & the silver frames askew; & the air of order, respectability, commonplace. “I’m going to call on the vicars wife.” Ethel immensely red & stout; churning out, poor old woman, the usual indefatigable egotism about deafness & her Mass. She must have a scene every six months. No. But of course, to be deaf, to be 76—well, back to Charleston with Eve & Angelica. And we called on the Wigrams & snubbed Stephen off."
1935.09.13,"What a combination for the superstitious! Driving off to visit Margaret & Lilian at Dorking; & I have got into a mild flood I think with The Ps Years. The difficulty is always at the beginning of chapters or sections where a whole new mood has to be caught plumb in the centre.

Richmond accepts my Marryat & thanks me for his poor little knighthood! L. is made all rigid by that d—d fool Brewster & his complaints about the photographs. To make matters worse, Dr Mary Gordon rings up to bother us about her life of the Ladies of Llangollen; & it has turned grey & windy. Am I to ask Angelica or not? These are my troubles, as the man said … Yesterday L. took the car in; (but I’m making up scenes: this began in the middle of last night). Then we walked to Lewes, & found the new way, after all these years, by the Canal, under the Bridge. And home to bowls, & veal cutlets. Reading Love for Love, Life of Anthony Hope, &c. A man could live on £200 at Oxford if he lived at home."
1935.09.15,"A terrific downpour. Never was such rain, I think, as this year. Autumn showing through. Autumn birds chirping through the rain. A queer book, Hope’s life—so neat, discreet, & somehow dated. An Edwardian writer making £70,000 out of books in 10 years; very much in the world, like a du Maurier; yet sensitive, depressed: much left out I guess; only a decorous shell, sitting sucking a gold knobbed cane by the Row. But genuine in its well bred way.

I am thinking I will broach the three boxes of Roger; very staidly, merely beginning to drop a few facts into my brain. Indeed I must, as people want letters & so on. But I swear I will not let it buzz me into excitement. I will keep a space for my P. P. little book. Anthony Hope lived in dread of going sterile. I dont think I ever envisage that as a possibility. I always say on the contrary, Shall I ever have time enough to write out all thats in my head? A much happier state; though suppose what’s in my head becomes sillier & feebler? But why should it? Not if I vary it sufficiently: what with pamphlets, criticism, poetry, fiction, & as I think a play perhaps. But then I’m a very slow writer. He did his book yearly. And The Years (that name is fixed; dropped like a billiard ball into a pocket) will have taken me very nearly 3 years—say I finish it by Christmas. And I never think, seriously, of dying.

Nessa & Duncan are to come to tea; Angelica & Eve to stay the night; then London, & L.’s labour party tomorrow. So the summer ends itself. A very hard working summer.

Margaret & Lilian in a pale yellow house, fitted as compactly as a ships cabin—fires let into the wall—baths turning into cupboards more or less—in a wood. Very nice tree opposite the sitting room, & spotted woodpeckers. The best view of that silly pretty Surrey country: M. in a cap; L. very blind. We had so much to say, they were so starved of talk, that in fact we said things of the utmost triviality. That was queer. And had to see over the house. A pile of dull 19th Century classics that L⁠[ilian]. wants to sell. All spick & span: very blue & yellow. M.’s melodramatic bad taste surprising. We drove through Rusper & other small dignified Surrey towns lying shut in, airless, among hedges: merely country. Now to write letter after letter. But I cant cross the garden in this rain. Percy has to hide. Even the Church bells, I think, dont ring. A black bird digging in the grass. And the rooks cawing through the down rush; through the mist of rain."
1935.09.17,"So they came: I mean all the Bells, & Janie, growing a little elderly & showing her grandfather the shoemaker, but very gayly dressed; a coloured comforter round her neck; a chic little knitted cap, & a black coat with silver buttons. Quentin like a large red & white sheepdog. Eve very pretty; mouse like with her pointed twitching nose. When I woke her early next morning she looked just like a white sleeping mouse. Angelica suddenly depressed. I think I did not get enough glow into the dinner, & she thought why did I want to come?

London yesterday: a violent storm of wind all night. Garden a litter of apples & branches. Percy busy staking up trees."
1935.09.20,"Yes it was a terrific storm; a storm to mark, I suppose. All the trees chocolate brown on the wind side; little leaves like chipped potatoes. We went to Seaford & saw the explosions of white water over the lighthouse. The cars were stopped by a policeman. Sea coming over the road. (I passed 5 minutes making up The Years, which is now going strong: only then we have Tom for the week end of course).

People were standing under the shelter of the Buckle Inn [facing the sea]. I went creeping round while L. took a photograph, & saw the people standing in the upper window, looking out: very 18th century; the lower windows & cellars boarded up. Clive Angelica & Q. yesterday. I’m ashamed to say I had longed for this week to be all alone; reading; never had a quiet week all this summer, & the balm it would be—& even a tea party means apprehension, breakage. Went to Lewes; bought a cake; left the car, tried walking home; fine but a great tearing wind; so stopped at Iford & took the bus. Poor old Clive a little battered I thought. A grey tuft. He has a curious antiquity, premature age, sometimes: I suppose when the top doesn’t spin. He had been spinning round Greece with Dadie, Shepherd [Sheppard], aristocrats, schoolmasters; was impressed by the beauty; enjoyed himself vastly. Must have done his owl vociferously. Was very nice, I’ve no doubt, & had dined God knows with what Lallas & Hoffmans & the rich & the great at Venice. All determined on war. Clive is writing a letter to the N.S. against war. War’s so awful it cant be right anyhow—an argument for which I like him: his genuine humanity. Dislike of being uncomfortable himself: yes; but he dislikes other people’s unhappiness too. Says Mu⁠[ssoli]⁠ni is mad—the Italians say so; but all the young are frothed up. Very cold. Sat over the fire. Two nights ago I started reading Roger. There’s all the schoolboy letters to begin on: whether its wise, I dont know. But I think I can—the boys are in the churchyard, & want to climb over & get our chestnuts, but see me—mass my day all together."
1935.09.23,"Reflections on Tom week end: that it is too long. Cant write. That he is more masterly; tells a story like one who has the right; is broader & bonier & more wild eyed—long almond shaped eyes—that he means to write modern verse plays: that he is self confident although going up Charleston Lane in the dark last night (Lottie advancing in her red jacket) he told me that he has no self confidence: Joyce has; but Joyce is interminably bored with everything. What can he do when he’s finished this book? Perhaps thats why he procrastinates. We dined at Charleston. Nessa ordered eleven grouse, having doubled the number, thinking of them halved: Clive, Janie, Angelica & Eve. Acting. A. did not remember her part. We walked. Long silences. Bruce Richmond brooded over the week end. His week end: his rotund country gentleman ways: port hock bedroom candles; & telling little stories. Tom likes going there; is magisterially accepting new experiences. Likes, more than we do, respectability. Went to service at 8 on Sunday: a wet morning, & he hea⁠[r]⁠d one old woman say to another—in the churchyard, “And she was lying in bed with a still born child beside her.” But he did his duty. A very nice man, Tom; I’m very fond of Tom, & at last not much knocked off my perch by him. That is, not as I was when he came here & I was writing Jacob’s. Room. Now he cant much disturb The Years, though he makes me feel that I want to write a play."
1935.09.26,"Why is this—that is the first scene with Sally & Maggie in the bedroom, the most difficult I have ever written?

Winifred Holtby is, I rather suspect, dying. It is a very fine day. Two luggers with brown sails are moving very slowly down the river. We were in London yesterday. And London is in full swing. “The Abyssinians have mobilised!” exclaims one suburban lady to another in the bus. And the other says “That was in the paper yesterday”. A great swarm in Rymans where I went to buy a case for my Roger notes. In future I shall write in loose leaf books, & so avoid these swelling pages. Mabel had a very nice lunch. I watched the men in T⁠[avistock]⁠ck Sqre eating on the pavement. They are having the road up with a drill. They eat with the point of the knife. They have lunch wrapped in newspaper. They warm some drink in a bucket. They have at least an hour off. But then I work my brain I say to myself. Belsher ill. Miss West travelling. Our last day up. Very glad to get back here. But the boys are making a bonfire in the field. We pray for a few days peace. Now 2 men want to come tomorrow to discuss the WEA at Rodmell. This must be mastered. L. had a certain amount of row with Kingsley about the L. party & the League."
1935.09.29,"Yesterday I saw the kingfisher again on the river. It flies across & across, very near the surface: it has a bright orange chocolate under side. And it is a tropical bird, sitting weighted on the bank. I have also seen a stoat—brown with a white tipped tail. Yesterday I went to Moggery Poke, back by the river. L. met me with Sarah [the dog], who wont walk with me. Her love increases. And I read the Lovers Melancholy & skimmed the top of the words; & want to go on reading things miles away—beautiful hard words, remote. Not Mrs Easdale, who is silly, egotistic, sloppy, & very conventional. I am shocked to find Rodmell patched on to those pages."
1935.10.02,"Yesterday we went to the L⁠[abour]. P⁠[arty]. meeting at Brighton, & of course, though I have refused to go again this morning, I am so thrown out of my stride that I cant hitch on to The Years again. Why? The immersion in all that energy & all that striving for something that is quite oblivious of me; making me feel that I am oblivious of it. No, thats not got it. It was very dramatic: Bevin’s attack on Lansbury. Tears came to my eyes as L⁠[ansbury]. spoke. And yet he was posing I felt—acting, unconsciously, the battered Christian man. Then Bevin too acted I suppose. He sank his head in his vast shoulders till he looked like a tortoise. Told L. not to go hawking his conscience round. And what is my duty as a human being? The women delegates were very thin voiced & insubstantial. On Monday one said, It is time we gave up washing up. A thin frail protest, but genuine. A little reed piping, but what chance against all this weight of roast beef & beer—which she must cook? All very vivid & interesting; but over lapping: too much rhetoric, & what a partial view: altering the structure of society: yes, but when its altered? Do I trust Bevin to produce a good world, when he has his equal rights? Had he been born a duke—My sympathies were with Salter who preached non-resistance. He’s quite right. That should be our view. But then if society is in its present state? Happily, uneducated & voteless, I am not responsible for the state of society. These are some of the minnows that go round my head, & distract me from what is, after all, my work. A good thing to have a day of disturbance—2 days even—but not 3. So I didnt go; & cant really write. However I will make myself when I’ve done this. Odd the enormous susceptibility of my mind to surface impressions: how I suck them in & let them swirl about. And how far does anybodies single mind or work matter? Ought we all to be engaged in altering the structure of society? Louie said this morning she had quite enjoyed doing for us, was sorry we were going. Thats a piece of work too in its way. And yet I cant deny my love of fashioning sentences. And yet … L. has gone there, & I daresay I’ll discuss it with him. He says politics ought to be separate from art. We walked out in the cold over the marsh, & discussed this. The fact is too my head easily tires. Yes, too tired to write. But a good thing to be too tired for that reason, minnows swirling, now & then. I will do some Roger."
1935.10.15,"Since we came back I have been in such full flush, with Years all the Seen: Janie, Walther, Joan Easdale; Nessa. Clive. Helen. Duncan. been to Richmond Park (saw snake by the Serpentine) Concert. Saw Morgan & Bob & Eth Williamson. Asked to speak at some lunch. Read all early R. letters. noted them also library books: also Keats: also MSS. morning, Roger between; tea & dinner, a walk, & people, that here’s a blank. And I only scamp Roger this evening because I wore a hole in my back yesterday; couldn’t write this morning; & must go up & receive Miss Grueber (to discuss a book on women & fascism—a pure have yer as Lottie would say) in 10 minutes. Yes, it has been 10 days of calm full complete bliss. And I thought how I shall hate it. Not a bit. London is quiet dry comfortable. I find my dinner cooked for me. No children screaming. And the sense of forging ahead easily strongly (this petered out today) at The Years. Three days I got into wild excitement over The Next War. Did I say the result of the L.P. at Brighton was the breaking of that dam between me & the new book, so that I couldn’t resist dashing off a chapter: stopped myself; but have all ready to develop—the form found I think—as soon as I get time? And I plan to do this sometime this next spring, while I go on accumulating Roger. This division is by the way perfect, & I wonder I never hit on it before—some book or work for a book thats quite the other side of the brain between times. Its the only way of stopping the wheels & making them turn the other way, to my great refreshment, & I hope improvement. Alas, now for Grueber."
1935.10.16,"What I have discovered in writing The Years is that you can only get comedy by using the surface layer—for example, the scene on the terrace. The question is can I get at quite different layers by bringing in music & painting together with certain groupings of human beings. This is what I want to try for in the raid scene: to keep going & influencing each other: the picture; the music, & the other direction—the action—I mean character telling a character—while the movement (that is the change of feeling as the raid goes on) continues.

Anyhow, in this book I have discovered that there must be contrast: one strata, or layer cant be developed intensively, as I did I expect in The Waves, without harm to the others. Thus a kind of form is, I hope, imposing itself, corresponding to the dimensions of the human being: one should be able to feel a wall made out of all the influences; & this should in the last chapter close round them at the party so that you feel that while they go on individually it has completed itself. But I havent yet got at this. I’m doing Crosby—an upper air scene this morning. The rest of going from one to another seems to me to prove that this is the right sequence for me at any rate. I’m enjoying the sequence, without that strain I had in The Waves."
1935.10.22,"I am again held up in The Years by my accursed love of talk. That is to say, if I talk, to Rose Macaulay from 4. to 6.30: to Elizabeth Bowen from 8 to 12 I have a dull heavy hot mop inside my brain next day & am a prey to every flea, ant gnat (as for example that I let P. Quennel misrepresent me & never answered him). So I have shut the book—Sal & Martin in Hyde Park—& spent the morning typing out Roger’s memoirs. This is a most admirable sedative & refresher. I wish I always had it at hand. Two days rest of that nerve is my prescription; but rest is hard to come by. I think I shall refuse all invitations to chatter parties till I’m done. Could it only be by Christmas! For instance, if I go to Edith Sitwell’s Cocktail this evening I shall only pick up some exacerbating picture: I shall froth myself into sparklets; & there’ll be the whole smoothing & freshening to begin again. But after The Years is done then I shall go everywhere: & expose every cranny to the light. As it is, who doesn’t come here? Every day this week I must talk. But in my own room I’m happier, I think. So I will now plod quietly through the Bridges letters, & perhaps begin to arrange all Helen’s tangled mass."
1935.10.27,"Adrian’s birthday, it strikes me. And we asked him to dine. No, I will not hurry this book. I’m going to let every scene shape fully & easily in my hands, before sending it to be typed, even if it has to wait another year. I wonder why time is always allowed to harry one. I think it rather good this morning. I’m doing Kitty’s party. And in spite of the terrific curb on my impatience—never have I held myself back so drastically—I’m enjoying this writing more fully & with less strain &—whats the word? I mean its giving me more natural pleasure than the others. But I have such a pressure of other books kicking their heels in the hall its difficult to go on, very slowly.

Yesterday we walked across Ken Wood to Highgate & looked at the 2 little old Fry houses. Thats where Roger was born & saw the poppy. I think of beginning with that scene. Yes, that book shapes itself. Then theres my Next War—which at any moment becomes absolutely wild, like being harnessed to a shark; & I dash off scene after scene. I think I must do it directly The Years is done. Suppose I finish The Years in Jan: then dash off The War (or whatever I call it) in six weeks: & do Roger next summer.

It is a grey dim windy day: I walked along the Euston Rd. & was beaten by its sheer gloom; came back & did Roger—P⁠[amela]’s letters; & I’m furious with Ellis Roberts who has told the PEN I wish to be elected."
1935.10.30,"By way of a symptom—just because, reaching for a book, I opened my first draft of What are we to do & read the first page, I cannot settle to The Years save by dint of severe prodding. My mind is once more flooded with the desire to be at that argument. It is true that this was, I suppose, suggested by having Miss White—nice not very highly intelligent but fresh, with a prominent nose, & eyes that oddly changed from hard to soft—to tea: (a New Zealander; her father a doctor; has been ranging about the world in Cargo steamers; now lives in a flat at Highgate)—then Miss Lynd, & Adrian & William to dinner. So that no doubt my nerve tension is loosened & twangs slightly. Anyhow, here is my hour for reading Roger or a tiresome half good half bad MS—wasted in mind spinning. A very fine October day.

Went to Peace Conference, by way of a joke, yesterday, & saw several baboon faced intellectuals; also some yearning, sad, green dressed negroes & negresses, looking like chimpanzees brought out of their cocoanut groves to try to make sense of our pale white platitudes. I took some notes; walked across the Green Park; bought a little Italian frame for 7/6. The woman said (when I only had 5/) “I can trust you—yes, for two days. And if you dont pay me, well then bad luck to you”. So home just in time to put buns in the oven for Miss White, who said, “Oh but you see this isn’t just visiting a publisher. It is seeing two famous people” & she stayed getting more at her ease, till 6.30. Then my Gray (3 volumes) had come; but I had no time to cut it, for at 8 the party began, & they stayed till 12.45. And then Lynd couldn’t get her mother’s new car to start, & A⁠[drian]. forgot his keys & came back to find them. A. very spruce lively & witty. We hit it off when other people are there. I have an impression that he is far more social than he was—staying away with the Lintotts. Miss L. rather too ‘dressed’ in red plush, with one jewel, & dark hair. Not clear cut enough about the nose & lips, a little brushed with the Lynd, I mean the professional scribbler, Priestley, Walpole brush. She said that Squire now runs about won’t do anything, drinks, & has deposited Lady S. in a small ugly house in Hampstead, being no longer the old country gentleman, but merely what he was originally—that is a scallywag. Mind I suppose all rubbed away by his scribbling—if he ever had one, which L. denies. Now today we have to go to tea with Mrs W⁠[oolf]: tomorrow Clive’s lunch; then M⁠[onks].H⁠[ouse]. & a meeting in the schoolroom; & on Monday I have to go to the BBC out of sheer curiosity, to hear a record which I have no intention of supplying. No answer from the P.E.N. I must note that not to be answered is far more crushing than to be answered. Even more than the usual shower of anti-Fascist leaflets. I go up & find that the Americans demand that I shall cable at their expense."
1935.11.01,"Now again I pay the penalty of mixing fact & fiction: cant concentrate on The Years. I have a sense that one cannot control this terrible fluctuation between the 2 worlds. Take the past days: Mrs Bennett touching me on the shoulder in Kensington Gardens. “This is Virginia’. A stocky little bright eyed girl in spectacles. Firing off bombs; but doesnt like the explosion. We talk about the name ‘Virginia’. L. emerges from the Lavatory. We go to Mrs W.; very hot; Flora there; in come the Howes [unidentified] Mrs H. has collected 100 seals (glass: not animal) at Caledonian market. A good day when she only spends a penny: has sometimes to spend 2/- What for? Her only stimulus—collecting glass seals. Mr H. walks. Off home. Ethel Sands asks me to see the Baroness Nostitz [see note 6 below]. Have to ring up & arrange to be back at 4.30. Cant get her.

Lunch with Clive. Desmond & Christabel. Confusion about Lottie & Dottie. We each sketched different characters; Lottie prehensile—Oh dear me no, said Desmond, poor girl, she’s amassed thing after thing & cant order them—Oh its Lottie youre talking about. Lord Berners’ Sapphist skit. No. You shall not waste your time on it. Lunch. “I’ve been talking about Lytton,” dining with James. C. becomes emotional. Cant we put up a tablet to Francis. Saint & Wit. But where? Gerrard Street? Do we like monuments? Yes, she says. Clive chivalrously agrees. Then, just as I began to talk to Desmond, easily, about Santayana’s book, C. chips in: must read us the D. of Argyll’s letter, (which I had read in [illegible] book). This finished the lunch.

(And I forgot that Ka came the night before, all in red lace, & as usual determined to assert her dignity her importance her social value, so that we spent all the time trotting out acquaintances & honours—this she does whenever she emerges from Cornwall) Then home; Lady Howard & the Baroness for L.: then up to Mary⁠[Hutchinson]’s, because she was hurt on the telephone that we hadn’t written; Rothschilds & Aldous Huxleys; more talk; sticky at the end: A. says all this signing anti-F⁠[ascist]. rumpus is mere chitter chatter; got off on biology; Victor had a copy of Gray’s Poper in red volume. I dont like that way of book buying & so home to bed & so cant even write this. Raining & we go to Rodmell where L. speaks. Yet its fluid & amusing in a way—not a patch on the other though. I must draw in for the last lap, would my friends allow.
"
1935.11.05,"A specimen day, yesterday: a specimen of the year 1935 when we are on the eve of the Duke of Gloucester’s wedding: of a general election: of the Fascist revolution in France: & in the thick of the Abyssinian war: it being mild warm November weather; at 2.30 we went to the BBC & listened to some incomparable twaddle—a soliloquy which the BBC requests me to imitate (a good idea, all the same, if one were free) with all the resources of the BBC behind one: real railway trains; real orchestras; noises; waves, lions & tigers &c; at 3. we reach Dorland Hall; a loudspeaker proclaiming the virtues of literature, the Princess Louise having just declared the show open & said that books are our best friends. There we meet old stringy Rose Macaulay, beating about, like a cat a hawking odds & ends; Gerald Duckworth, covered with small prickly red squares, as if he had fallen on his face in a bramble bush; (Fisher) Unwin; & so out: home; at 5.15: telephone; the Baroness Nostitz has arrived early; will we see her now; up she comes; a monolithic broad faced Hindenburg, bulky; cant get in or out of my chair; says Germany is the better for Hitler;—so they say: but of course I’m not a politician: I want to get some young man to lecture on English poetry; has a rather hard, dominating impassive eye: slow, stately; must have been a beauty; statuesque; aristocratic. Then a card: in comes the Indian; stays till 7.30. was turned out of a carriage in Bengal.

Thats an Indian! the lady cried

If you dont go, I shall kick you.

He jumped out, happily into bushes, as the train was going 15 miles an hour. Liberty, justice. A girl who shot at the Governor. Hatred of the British rule. Still, its better than the Italian. Mss [Mussolini] is paying their fare & hotel bills in order to get them to side with him. You are our allies. The British will be kicked out. And now Morgan rings up—what about Jules Romains? Will you meet him. May I lunch to discuss the French question. And so we go on.

Another specimen day."
1935.11.10,"Specimen days have somewhat relaxed later in the week. I seem to recall some walks—a great deal of rain: the D & Dss of Gloucester driving through the Sqre: she bright & gay: he like Cory: & then I met the royal coach empty & noted the white bottoms of the postilions, & the rather sheepish look of the footmens faces in the daylight, all dressed up. Then, last night there was Day Lewis at the Book show, a man who makes queer faces; very nervous at first; with blurred eyes; a nice sensitive young man; but I think it would have been better read, his speech. All poets are misfits & therefore want communion with the common people. A good deal about the Trinity: some bite in him: to explain their desire to write not pure poetry but——? What exactly is poetry that is part the desire to communicate with the common people? Political poetry? Certainly its not easy, one word Wordsworth poetry. Instead of the Leech Gatherer [Wordsworth] the tank & poison gas. Yes. Too much theory: too little gift I think & too much public speaking. But then if he wants to be in touch with the common people he must talk at Book shows. Not very anxious I think to dine with us, for which I liked him. The usual hurry & scramble of literary gents: poor red scrannel faced [Herbert] Palmer, & Rose again hawking round the area railings for scraps. So to dine at Gennaro—not very good; to N. Gallery movies—not very good; & home in the cold.

A letter from Bruce R. asking me to write more leaders; from Joe, asking me to write for The Listener. And L. says we are going to have a very lean year at the Press. I must consider money again for a moment—how not to make too much or too little, & so on."
1935.11.18,"Our election week end was not a wise move, personally. I was silly though. Why go to Patcham in pouring rain? Even if I didn’t stay in London & hear Ethel’s case, as I wished, it was foolish to have hours trapesing in the violent wind & wet to Rodmell. A wild grey white sea, & so many stops all the time, as we passed it, to take up the workmen who are building at Peacehaven. So a headache next day; & this morning a throat. I am held up & damped down. We missed Quentin & Nessa last night, from headache; and have to dine with Raymond & go to Aldous party tonight.

It struck me tho’ that I have now reached a further stage in my writers advance. I see that there are 4? dimensions; all to be produced; in human life; & that leads to a far richer grouping & proportion: I mean: I: & the not I: & the outer & the inner—no I’m too tired to say: but I see it: & this will affect my book on Roger. Very exciting: to grope on like this. New combinations in psychology & body—father like painting. This will be the next novel, after The Years."
1935.11.21,"Yes, but these upper air scenes get too thin. Reflection after a morning of Kitty & Edward in Richmond. At first theyre such a relief though after the other that one gets blown & flies ahead. The thing is to take it quietly; go back; & rub out detail; too many ‘points’ made: too jerky, & as it were talking ‘at’. I want to keep the individual & the sense of things coming over & over again & yet changing. Thats whats so difficult: to combine the two.

Last night L. was woken at one, by a man shouting abuse of Woolf & Quack in German under his window. Ought we to tell the police? I think it was a drunken undergraduate.

After our dinner at Raymond’s with Aldous & the subconscious hostility I always feel there, I’m facing the fact that my next book, Professions, The Next War, will need some courage. 2 million women all longing for men, Aldous said. Raymond insisted, with his little hard squeak, that men were now unfairly treated: have to maintain a woman wife. Went on to Albany. Party for the German theyve married to the postman—for £50. I talked to crazy Bob Nichols, & had my hand pressed by the rather sordid fat [word illegible] greyfaced intense Naomi [Mitchison], who wants to come & see us."
1935.11.22,"The four old ladies sitting round the tea table at Aubrey House last night made me think of a nest of little rats.; Why? One got up—Mrs Bridges—more pointed than the others. People say she’s like Lady Fry. Old Eliz? pours, tea; deaf; carpenters; once smoked when 9. Rachel brings out book about Aubrey House. Its a 17th Century house, like a college, with a quadrangle, trees. Long 18th Cent looking room; all shining: with the Dutch pictures collected by Mr Alexander. “In this room there was gummed together the first petition for Women’s Rights. John Stuart Mill carried it to Parliament. The Peter Taylors had this house. We’ve had it for 60 years.” Some joke about one of the sisters not being yet 60. Three boxes of cigarettes—“My nephews”. I sat over log fire with Mrs B. who said she cdnt write. B⁠[ridges]. refused to have a Biogy. Used to put his feet on the mantelpiece & say “Now I’ll write a letter.” Did it first in pencil & then ink. Used to say things straight out. Roger very sensitive—used to stay with them—a 3 cornered friendship. Didnt know his wife—she wore a check skirt—not at my ease with her—sorry about the quarrel over the pictures: R. minded very much—Well I’ve really nothing to tell you: Story of bowls at Failand. May we play bowls father? Robert wants to. R⁠[oger] asking Sir Edward’s permission.
"
1935.11.27,"Too many specimen days—so I cant write, yet, Heaven help me, have a feeling that Ive reached the no man’s land that I’m after; & can pass from outer to inner, & inhabit eternity. A queer very happy free feeling, such as I’ve not had at the finish of any other book. And this too is a prodigious long one. So what does it mean?

But Oh my specimen days: Sunday Ray [Strachey] for tea; dine at the hotel with Mrs W.: course after course, all bad; to Nessa’s: she & Duncan alone with new cat, Ruff: Monday, to the NatGall Francks [unidentified]; rather lost my head, too tired to think; settle my mind; Miss White [Whyte,] Stephen S. dine: Sally Graves Helen Igor in after; Tuesday; Stephen Tom & Edith Hales (Boston) tea. Black edged card handed me. M & Mme Gillet; all ruined, dryed: 3 hours wasted. L. annoyed, no music, too tired to read, & cant write; & Ethel Sands to tea, & Vita lunches tomorrow. Why cant I get quit of it all? Still happiness persists. And now for 30 mins of Roger’s letters to Helen—that vast sparkling dust heap, the best so far; but how to dig out? how to represent? I must read & read & wait on the moment of illumination. Cold frosty weather, dry for a miracle, & very sunny."
1935.11.28,"Another balk this morning: cant get the start off of the last chapter right. Whats wrong I dont know. But I needn’t hurry. And the main thing is to let ideas blow, easily; & come softly pouring. And not to be too emphatic. Of course to step straight into the middle of a new character is difficult: North: & I’m a little exacerbated; meant to have a quiet week, & heres Nelly C⁠[ecil]. & Nan Hudson both asking to come; & will I ring up: & Nan has a Turkish friend. But I will not be rushed. No."
1935.12.04,"I must take 10—no 5—minutes off before going up, & from reading Roger to Helen. I read & read & the packets hardly lessen, & I think of love, & L. & me; & the different lives. Yesterday Day Lewis wrote that his agent advises him to leave us for a larger firm, as he must make money. This revives the question of the Press—once again, once again. We both said walking at Caen Wood yesterday, we will now decide on a date & stop it. Yes: reading Roger I want to be free to travel as he was: free of MSS. Yet how keep our books? Or shall we try to hand it on to an intelligent youth? I rather doubt if such exist, or able to run it alone, & then we should still be tied. Raining. A lovely perfectly filled day yesterday: walk; alone; Romeo & Juliet in the evening. How fresh, rich, various coloured—& then think of the pale New England morality murder."
1935.12.10,"I have only 3 minutes before the clock strikes, & not much paper left. I spend my spare hour or half hour reading Roger to Helen—that explains. And next year I shall have a loose leaf book. So many people again. Nelly Cecil yesterday. I like her. Better than Colefax who cut me for Madame d’Erlanger. Thats a joke. Clive intends to spread it & rub it in: never mind.

I have promised to deliver The Years by 15th Feb. And had a bad mornings work in consequence. And Angus [Davidson] & Mary Fisher tonight. But if I want more time, I shall take it. I’m not time’s fool—no. Save that I must go up to lunch. Always write as if a cynical eye, doubting were on me. Nessa I thought very sad again, dining with Clive. What thin stuff we talk compared with what we used to talk. And then people say death doesnt matter. Clive hopping on his canary perch: V. very silent: L. too. Bought stuff for a dress, pretty stuff to amuse myself."
1935.12.11,"It went all right last night, on the whole. Mary [Fisher] has bright, rather beautiful eyes; but her lips are thin, & her nose too pointed. But she has all the competence of the world of masters & cabinet ministers; rather a mercy. Grown more decided. But the pigeons were tough. Helen & Alix after dinner. Talk of Lear, of Huxleys; of this that & the other; till L. got silent. Letter from Sybil [Colefax]. Carefully composed lies, about a tiresome woman in Piccadilly wanting to consult her about bedroom curtains at 5.30. I wonder she thinks it worth while. And I shall reply Full up."
1935.12.14,"Dinner last night with the [Aldous] Huxleys: not altogether a sparkler. Julian & his wife, whom I did not recognise, but later understood from his eyebrows &c who he was. A very chirpy I dont know why I think him dull, man. Full of scraps of information; & the same quickness that Aldous has—the same vivacity—but less sympathetic. And I guess that they spar—Julian & Juliette. She would have her say—about politics: he breasted her. But Maria & I talked after dinner, about Lotte Wolf—did I say I’d spent 2 hours over their Dutch writing table under the black lamp being analysed? That was the evening Morgan rang up & said he had to have an operation: & I was very gloomy, in my funeral way, going to Piccadilly in the bitter cold, & walking down Regent St. by mistake. Then Morgan dined with us, & had a little private talk with L. I think he feels he may die. Naturally. Aldous has a man in Switzerland however who does the operation from behind, & its over, & the patient cured in a day. Aldous in great flow: enjoys London; is getting on well with his novel; & thus juicy, sympathetic. He has a sense of the suffering, as well as of the infamy of the world. Had been getting Bryan Guiness to subscribe towards the Prince; who sits 2 doors off us, starving under his purple robes. Cheeks sunk; pouting starving Aldous said, in a room of the flat of some people who teach Russian. And he led us down the long gallery to the cab."
1935.12.16,"A question, how to do Roger. Why not begin at the end with Le Mas: a whole day; & then work backwards: give the elements in combination in action, first; & then trace them—give specimen days, all through his life.

Le Mas: the mosquitoes &c. his cooking: the colour, the martins: the French novel: freedom—cast back to childhood. Quote. Then Cambridge, then America: then us. Then the end."
1935.12.17,"How terrified I’m getting of Ethel⁠[Sands’]⁠s dressed dinner tomorrow! It makes a kind of ring round my mind. What I’m to wear: my velvet or chiffon: then my hair. When I’m there it’ll be as easy as shelling peas—why this apprehension? Wolff never touched on that by the way.

Sally Graves to tea: stayed till 7. A resolute cornered mind, defiant rather; balanced; pleased L.: she’s to write on Socialism. Told me I’m abused by the Graves’ in their new magazine; said the Mag was laughable. Said she was going to Paris; & I liked her; but not effusively. Too clever: too young. All in black. On the defensive. Now Bore Will [Robson] to lunch. Shopped yesterday. I sit on a rubber cushion & can so type."
1935.12.18,"I’ve had a bad morning at The Years, & feel it will spray off at the end. Thats I think because I had to see M⁠[argery Fry], at Holland Park & missed my mooning airy easy afternoon—the only soother of my tired head. So started making up in bed: so tired; & have to dine with Sands tonight. & Ethel S⁠[myth]. rings up at 8.30 inviting herself to lunch. Please God we shall set off on Friday: & dear old Morgan has his operation tomorrow. A cold fine day."
1935.12.19,"Dinner last night: the Bruce Richmonds; the Maclagans; Leigh Ashton, & a sprinkling of elderly bachelors. Not a twinge of alarm in it—only the horrid beforehand discomfort—hair doing—rose buying—& setting out in cold. And B.R. was the spryest & liveliest of the lot. L. Ashton swollen, plum pudding faced; & such silences—Elena almost stupid to extinction—unvisited by a single idea—sitting silent; rough faced; oh so commonplace & we all so elderly; & not a spark or a twinkle; a rather spare dinner; & at 11 everyone got up, & the car hadn’t come. And it was for this I crossed London in evening dress—this is society."
1935.12.20,"“Its because one changes one’s values” Nessa said last night, when we discussed why we cdnt paint or write after a dinner party. And thats true. Only artists know how to live. She cant paint after a party. Cant get back into those proportions—Worse for women, because they have to be more active at parties: have to throw themselves into it. She wont go anywhere now where they make her dress. The best thing about our notoriety such as it is is that we can see anyone we want here on our own terms. The bell went on ringing. Tut. Popkin. Clive & Benita—all by appointment to sign some documents in Duncan’s room. And as he had stuck up a notice saying Out, Flossie had to come constantly to say Mr Popkins says he’s out. Tell Popkins to go in. Then Helen—And I was not glad to see her, wh. she felt—(to my disgrace) & after one cup went. And Nessa had chosen a nice rug. And had had her London Group meeting there. And this must be the last entry in this book because we are just about to go to Rodmell for Christmas.

[Diary XXV]"
1935.12.28,"Its all very well to write that date in a nice clear hand, because it begins this new book, but I cannot disguise the fact that I’m almost extinct; like a charwomans duster; that is my brain: what with the last revision of the last pages of The Years. And is it the last revision? And why should I lead the dance of the days with this tipsy little spin? But in fact I must stretch my cramped muscles: its only half past eleven on a damp grey morning, & I want a quiet occupation for an hour. That reminds me—I must devise some let down for myself that wont be too sudden when the end is reached. An article on Gray I think. But how the whole prospect will take different proportions, once I’ve relaxed this effort. Shall I ever write a long book again—a long novel that has to be held in the brain, at full stretch—for close on 3 years? Nor do I even attempt to ask if its worth while. There are mornings so congested I cant even copy out Roger. Goldie depresses me unspeakably. Always alone on a mountain top asking himself how to live, theorising about life; never living. Roger always down in the succulent valleys, living. But what a thin whistle of hot air Goldie lets out through his front teeth. Always live in the whole, life in the one: always Shelley & Goethe, & then he loses his hot water bottle; & never notices a face, or a cat or a dog or a flower, except in the glow of the universal. This explains why his highminded books are unreadable. Yet he was so charming, intermittently."
1935.12.29,"I have in fact just put the last words to The Years—rolling, rolling, though its only Sunday, & I allowed myself till Wednesday. And I am not in such a twitter as usual. But then I meant it to end calmly—a prose work. And is it good? That I cannot possibly tell. Does it hang together? does one part support another? Can I flatter myself that it composes; & is a whole? Well there still remains a great deal to do. I must still condense, & point; give pauses their effect, & repetitions, & the run on. It runs in this version to 797 pages: say 200 each (but thats liberal) it comes to roughly 157,000—shall we say 140,000. Yes, it needs sharpening, some bold cuts, & emphases. That will take me another—I dont know how long. And I must subconsciously wean my mind from it finally & prepare another creative mood, or I shall sink into acute despair. How odd—that this will all fade away & something else take its place. And by this time next year, I shall be sitting here, with a vast bundle of press cuttings—no: not in the flesh, I hope; but in my mind there will be the usual Chorus of what people have said about this mass of scribbled type writing, & I shall be saying, That was an attempt at that; & now I must do something different. And all the old, or new, problems will be in front of me. Anyhow the main feeling about this book is vitality, fruitfulness, energy. Never did I enjoy writing a book more, I think: only with the whole mind in action, not so intensely as The Waves."
1935.12.30,"And today, no its no go. I cant write a word; too much headache. Can only look back at The Years as an inaccessible Rocky Island, which I cant explore, cant even think of. At Charleston yesterday. The great yellow table with very few places. Reading Roger I become haunted by him. What an odd posthumous friendship—in some ways more intimate than any I had in life. The things I guessed are now revealed; & the actual voice gone. Clive Quentin, Nessa Duncan. A little boasting. Some laughter over Mrs Easdale. Politics—but carefully subdued.

I had an idea—I wish they’d sleep—while dressing—how to make my war book—to pretend its all the articles editors have asked me to write during the past few years—on all sorts of subjects. Shd. women smoke. Short skirts. War—&c. This wd give me the right to wander: also put me in the position of the one asked. And excuse the method: while giving continuity. And there might be a preface saying this, to give the right tone. I think thats got it.

A wild wet night—floods out: rain as I go to bed: dogs barking: wind battering. Now I shall slink indoors, I think, & read some remote book."
1936.01.03,"I began the year with 3 entirely submerged days, headache, head bursting, head so full, racing with ideas; & the rain pouring; the floods out; when we stumbled out yesterday the mud came over my great rubber boots; the water squelched in my soles; so this Christmas has been, as far as country is concerned, a failure, & in spite of what London can do to chafe & annoy I’m glad to go back, & have, rather guiltily, begged not to stay here another week. Today it is a yellow grey foggy day; so that I can only see the hump, a wet gleam, but no Caburn. I am content though because I think that I have recovered enough balance in the head to begin The Years, I mean the final revision on Monday. This suddenly becomes a little urgent, because for the first time for some years, L. says I have not made enough to pay my share of the house, & have to find £70 out of my hoard. This is now reduced to £700, & I must fill it up. Amusing, in its way, to think of economy again. But it would be a strain to think seriously; & worse—a brutal interruption—had I to make money by journalism. The next book I think of calling Answers to Correspondents…. But I must not at once stop & make it up. No. I must find a patient & quiet method of soothing that excitable nerve to sleep until The Years is on the table—finished; In February? Oh the relief—as if a vast—what can I say—bony excrescence—bag of muscle—were cut out of my brain. Yet its better to write that than the other. A queer light on my psychology. I can no longer write for papers. I must write for my own book. I mean I at once adapt what I’m going to say, if I think of a newspaper."
1936.01.04,"The weather has improved, & we have decided to stay till Wednesday. It will now of course rain. But I will make some good resolutions: to read as few weekly papers, which are apt to prick me into recollection of myself, as possible, until this Years is over; to fill my brain with remote books & habits; not to think of Answers to C.ds; & altogether to be as fundamental & as little superficial, to be as physical & as little apprehensive, as possible. And now to do Roger; & then to relax. For, to tell the truth, my head is still all nerves; & one false move means racing despair, exaltation, & all the rest of that familiar misery: that long scale of unhappiness. So I have ordered a sirloin & we shall go for a drive. L. is happier: will now do his trees."
1936.01.05,"I have had another morning at the old plague. I rather suspect that I have said the thing I meant, & any further work will only muddle. Further work must be merely to tidy & smooth out. This seems likely because I’m so calm. I feel well, thats done. I want to be off on something else. Whether good or bad, I dont know. And my head is quiet today, soothed by reading The Trumpet Major last night, & a drive to the floods. The clouds were an extraordinary tropical birds wing colour: an impure purple; & the lakes reflected it, & there were droves of plover black & white; & all very linear in line & pure & subtle in colour. How I slept! Gray again today: but I shall not go to tea with Clive & Raymond. No news of Morgan. I cd. hardly listen to the news for fear they wd. begin We regret …"
1936.01.07,"I have again copied out the last pages, & I think got the spacing better. Many details & some fundamentals remain. The snow scene for example. & I suspect a good many unfaced passages remain. But I preserve my sense that its stated; & I need only use my craft not my creation. A pouring day—a day so wet that L. had to come in a mackintosh, & to spare him I drank my coffee in the dining room by candlelight. No news of Morgan? Why? Joe’s faithless. All the angles of the twigs have white drops on them. Thats Hardy’s gift by the way. minute obstinately individual observations. But how his reputation ever mounted, considering the flatness, tedium, & complete absence of gift of the T. Major, I cant say: & wd like to discover. I think he had genius & no talent. And the English love genius. I’m English enough too to feel my own past as a peasant expand his notes. Tom [T. S. Eliot], the American, cant; feels nothing I suppose. I think of taking sentences from great writers & expanding them. But then I’m always feathering round for some way of liberating my critical apprehensions which dont fit the strait jacket of the regular Times leader any longer. Anyhow this rain dissolves my guilt in wishing to go back. And I’ve had one or two sublime quiet evenings here—evenings of immunity, using that word in its highest sense."
1936.01.10,"Back again. A great gale all yesterday & a dusk over everything & rain, so that the comfort I had expected was diminished. Origo to tea; & wants to dine next week. All the same I will keep my hands on the reins. For, to tell the truth, this six weeks is going to be a most perilous enterprise. How on earth to finish, to get typed, to correct by the end of Feb? To show my state, I mistook 11 for 12 on my watch this morning; so shut up my book & stopped work with such relief that, when I discovered the mistake, I couldn’t bring myself to do the extra hour & did Roger instead. How then am I going to finish? My head is so springless. What I plan is to finish this long last lap for typing say by Monday or Tuesday: send it to Mabel [typist], & then begin at the chapter I stopped at, & go through again, & so keep the whole reading till I’ve got it all retyped. But can I do this in the time? I’m going to space my days as carefully as I can, resting after lunch, & reading only with the skin of the eye. But its the chronic problem of people that is the crux (what a word). Heres Dadie asking us to Cambridge; & old Ethel on the alert; & the usual letters. The C⁠[ambridge]. U⁠[niversity]. Lit. Soc, Dadie says, is asking me to lecture. Let it. A text for my letter. Origo rather contorted: says Italy is blind red hot devoted patriotic: has thrown her wedding ring into the cauldron too. Anticipates a long war, & then the peace they cd have had a month ago. They are more set than on the great war. 2 meatless days a week."
1936.01.11,"This book is now becoming the oddest hop o’ my thumb work: I peck & stop; peck & stop again. Think even of continuing this after tea. Its better than trying to work straight ahead. This is one of my pauses. Twelve o’clock—a very fine day. Asked to lecture to the Cambridge English Club. Shall I say anything of what I think of these invitations? I suppose not—not yet. Ann popped in suddenly after lunch; bare legs, socks, touseled hair: wanted to borrow the second vol. of War & Peace for Judith who’s had her tonsils out. Something like a rugger blue, in a striped jersey, very tall, & vigorous. She says she has many friends in the colleges—young men—but we shouldn’t know them. Then I read Borrow’s Wild Wales, into which I can plunge head foremost; then L. went to see Morgan, found him with the usual Bugger crew: & I to tea with Nessa; & Duncan came in, & we discussed the bugger crew; which Duncan dislikes when its self conscious, as at Raymond’s, & I always liken to the male urinal. Then L. came—You see I leave out the quality of the talk … it was very sympathetic. We discussed journalism, the NS: its hard bright up to date reviews; D. had been dining with Colefax to meet Max. He becomes social—is so naturally, even though he goes on the wrong day & imagines S⁠[ibyl], having tea—bread & butter alone. Home, & dine alone, & sleep over Mr Clarkson’s memoirs. He had a sexual kink, & a passion for fish—ran Sara Bernhardt’s errands; & I suppose—but all details are lacking, made 40,000 wigs for one show."
1936.01.13,"The precious days are ticking over. About 30 now left me, & how much to do! But my new method is working I think: each hour mapped in bed, & kept to, so far. Ann & Cr. Strachey to dine last night. Christopher a charming babbling humane boy, with a great deal of Oliver—in the voice chiefly—some of the Costello coarseness, of feature; but far more dash & vitality than a pure blooded Strachey. Laughter. Talk, of course, of Gumbo & Ray; Ray & Gumbo getting naked & swimming. Yet, though the thought of R.’s nakedness makes me squirm, she has humanised her son. He eats 4 eggs, on equal terms, as he says, with her, for Sunday supper. And he was concerned that in Gumbo’s new house, ordered from a catalogue, there is only a little box room for the servant. How very unlike Lytton! But he says that Oliver is also humane. Ann in her red; an ungainly girl; but silent, brooding, with opinions, chiefly medical & political. She sells the Daily Worker (3 copies) then breaks in on Cr. who is playing Bach on the piano, & demands eggs & biscuits for lunch at 3.30. Nessa, Clive, Duncan came in: but we drew the young on to chatter about B.B.

I walked somewhere on the Sunday streets & L. went to Mrs W. & met Babs &c. with the Alsatian, which had to be returned. She had just bought it in Pug Row, if thats the name of the dog selling street in Whitechapel. Fog—mitigated fog this morning."
1936.01.16,"Seldom have I been more completely miserable than I was about 6.30 last night, reading over the last part of The Years. Such feeble twaddle—such twilight gossip it seemed; such a show up of my own decrepitude, & at such huge length. I could only plump it down on the table & rush up stairs with burning cheeks to L. He said This always happens. But I felt, no it has never been so bad as this. I make this note should I be in the same state after another book. Now this morning, dipping in, it seems to me, on the contrary, a full, bustling live book. I looked at the early pages. I think there’s something to it. But I must now force myself to begin regular sending to Mabel. 100 pages go tonight I swear.

Iris Origo to dine alone. At first I thought this too is going to be a wash out. But, chiefly owing to L.’s charm, & making myself a little drunk, we all chattered, more intimately than we should have done had John been there or William or Harold, & we both liked her. And she is to come again. A genuine woman, I think, honest, intelligent &, to my pleasure, well dressed: also being a snob, I like her Bird of Paradise flight through the gay world. A long green feather in her hat suggests the image."
1936.01.19,"I open this, forced by a sense of what is expected by the public, to remark that Kipling died yesterday; & that the King (George 5th) is probably dying today. The death of Kipling has set all the old war horses of the press padding round their stalls; & the papers have to eke out 5 or 6 columns with the very bare bulletin—condition causes anxiety—which they supplement with biographies of doctors, of nurses, pictures of Sandringham, remarks of old villagers, gossip about the little Princesses in their cherry coloured coats, a snow man, &c. But the fact remains that all the Princes have gathered together, & I suppose at any moment the butler may come in, just as theyre finishing dinner, & say King Edward 8th, upon which—but I need hardly invent that scene having already so many on my hands.

Privately, I rang up Nessa at 6 yesterday & was alarmed by the agitated & breathless way in which she said Not now: I’ll ring later. This left me to imagine any number of catastrophes, but I find this morning that I interrupted the crisis of that London Group meeting, which went entirely against Nessa & Duncan’s cabal; they dismissed the President, & elected Sickert. And now, at the same time that the King dies, Nessa & Duncan think of resigning & starting a new Group. It is coldish snowy weather: the snow half melts half freezes; & I pad along, & Judith dined here, & we talked to James & Alix, walked by the Serpentine & must now lunch.

I went up to an elderly stout woman reading the paper at The Times Book Club the other day. It was Margery Strachey. What are you doing? I said. Nothing! she replied. “I’ve got nowhere to go & nothing to do.”

And I left her, sitting reading The Times."
1936.01.20,"This story I repeated to Duncan last night. He also had met Marjorie at The Times. She had flung her arms round him & kissed him. Another side of Marjorie’s story. They were badly beaten, Nessa & Duncan; but both elected to the Cttee all the same. They had not arranged any speaker on their side, &, as neither of them spoke, & Nan & Ethel were silent, & the others had actually written out speeches, the result as they say was a foregone conclusion.

And the King is not dead, but the same. It is a very fine bright day; I think I must force myself to go to Lewis’s & get a dress made; &—&—we are dining with Alice Ritchie. Sibyl is only too ready to come."
1936.01.21,"The King died last night. We were dining with Alice Ritchie, & drove back past Buckingham Palace. It was a clear dry night, rather windy & rather cold. As we turned the corner & came by the Palace we saw cars drawn up all along the Mall. There were thin lights. On the white monument people were standing: only everybody seemed to be moving. There was a cluster like a swarm of bees, round the railings. Some people were plastered against the railings, holding on to the bars. There was a discreet frame, like a text, holding a bulletin. We had [to] drive on past the Monument before the policeman, who spoke with weary politeness, would let us stop. Then we got out, & walked back, crossing with difficulty because cars were passing all the time, & tried to shove our way through the crowd. But it was impossible. So I asked a policeman “What is the latest bulletin?” And he said, It has not been issued. So I said But what is the latest news. I havent heard. (We had only seen Strength diminishing on the placards as we drove out) to which he replied “His majesty’s life is drawing to a peaceful close.” This he said without conviction, as if he were reciting words put into his mouth, but with a certain official tolerance. There was some agitation & excitement; many foreigners talking German; a large proportion of distinguished looking men, in semi evening dress; everyone indeed looked rather tall; but by no means tragic; yet not gay; rather suppressing their excitement; & it was all very brightly lit. As we turned away, a firework—a silver gilt sputtering fizzing torch began bubbling up, like a signal, like a festival, but it was presumably a photographers light. The crowd clustering on the rails became chalky white for a few seconds; & then we got into the car & drove home. The streets were very empty. But save for the occasional placard—it was now “The King is Dying”—there was nothing out of the way. What I took for guns booming was only the banging of the loose door in the mews. But at 3 this morning, L. was woken by paper boys shouting in the street. The King had in fact died at 12.5. He was dead when we were outside the palace. There were one or two narrow lights in the little top windows, I remember. Otherwise all the white curtains were drawn.

Most of the men in Southampton Row wear black ties wh. are brand new, or dark blue ties, which are the nearest they can get. In the stationers the woman spoke with a subdued kindness as if we were both mourning a great uncle we had never seen. The woman in Dennisons said she often thought herself it was absurd only to sell plain labels by the thousand. A very fine cold day. Sun shining."
1936.01.22,"The people of America are mourning, as if for their own King; & the Japanese are in tears. So it goes on. But as a matter of fact the Prime Minister [Stanley Baldwin]—we are only allowed official announcements on the BBC—& if you turn it on you only hear the ticking of a vast clock—was rather fitting; almost sincere, & very well conditioned. He gave out the impression that he was a tired country gentleman; the King another; both enjoyed Christmas at home; & the Queen is very lonely; one left the other taken, as must happen to married couples; & the King had seemed to him tired lately, but very kind, & quiet as if ready for a long journey; & had woken once or twice, on the last day & had said something Kind (‘Kind’ was the adjective always) & had said to his Secretary “How is the Empire?”—an odd expression. “The Empire, Sir, is well”; whereupon he fell asleep. And then of course, he ended with God Save the King.

The shops are all black. “We always carry a large stock” the woman at Lewis’s said. But there’ll be nothing doing after this rush at all. There’ll be no work for us…” Mourning is to outlast the London Season. A black Ascot."
1936.01.27,"I have done something so incredibly idiotic—left my last chapter at Monks yesterday—that I can hardly get over it. And there I was in the rush of the end. We went to Canterbury & I listened to a full service while L. lectured in the County Hotel. But I wont write my impressions. Almost smashed coming back—lights went out—we backed—a great car swung down, like a liner at sea, & was I thought on us. But missed. So home. Over to Nessa’s: Quentin there. Duncan spent an hour blocked in his car outside Westminster. The death trudge goes on till 6 am. & I forgot to say we saw the coffin & the Princes come from Kings X: standing packed in the Square democracy, though held back by Nessa, swarmed through; leapt the chain, climbed the trees. Then they came, the coffin with its elongated yellow leopards, the crown glittering & one pale blue stone luminous, a bunch of red & white lilies: after that 3 undertakers in black coats with astrachan collars: “our King” as the woman next me called him, who looks blotched & as if chipped by a stone mason: only his rather set wistful despair marked him from any shopkeeper—not an ingratiating face: bloated, roughened, as if by exposure to drink life grief & as red as a fisherboys. Then it was over. & I shall not try to see more. But the whole world will be afoot at dawn tomorrow."
1936.01.28,"The King is at this moment being buried, & if I go up I shall hear the service. A fine mild morning. The sun is out, the streets almost empty. An occasional hoot. No registered post this morning. And a tea party this afternoon.

The most extraordinary thing about writing is that when you’ve struck the right vein, tiredness goes. It must be an effort, thinking wrong, at 5 to one, after a sterile bitter morning, the vein flows: I think now I see to the end."
1936.02.09,"It is now the 9th of Feb & I have three weeks in which to finish my book. Hence this stolen minute—stolen while waiting to go round to the meeting at Adrian’s—is the first I have had in wh. to make even this elementary note. I work 3 hours in the morning: 2 often after tea. Then my head swells & I sleep."
1936.02.25,"And this will show how hard I work. This is the first moment—this 5 minutes before lunch—that I’ve had to write here. I work all the morning: I work from 5 to 7 most days. Then I’ve had headaches. Vanquish them by lying still & binding books & reading D. Copperfield. I have sworn that the script shall be ready, typed & corrected, on the 10th March. L. will then read it. And I’ve still all the Richmond & El. scene to type out; many corrections in that most accursed raid scene to make; all this to have typed; if I can by the 1st which is Sunday; & then I must begin at the beginning & read straight through. So I’m quite unable either to write here, or to do Roger. On the whole, I’m enjoying it—thats odd—though in the ups & downs, & with no general opinion."
1936.02.29,"Leap Year day. A great deal of fuss about the marmots. In fact, these weeks of solitude, seeing no one, only going round to Nessa, refusing all parties—Sheppard, to see Greek Play, Ellis Roberts to meet Max, & so on—have a space & quiet thats rather favourable to private fun. I become so absorbed in The Years that I take the other world as a kind of amplification, variation in another key. Nothing interferes for the moment; & I rush on; should in fact rush on this morning; but have done so much copying—the Oxford Street scene—that I cant cut ice any more. L. is lunching with the Robsons. It is drizzling. It is a damp dismal day. All Duncan’s pictures have been refused—to give a scrap of upper air news—by the Q. Mary. A great Bloomsbury agitation set on foot. But they think Sir Percy Bates when persuaded, gently, by the whole connoisseurship of London, may be bamboozled into relenting. All the Cabinet has been murdered in Tokyo. Lydia is a great success at Cambridge. Clive in Paris. I read Quennel on Byron: dont like that young mans clever agile thin blooded mind: & very little else that counts. L. began this morning against Mabel again: because she asked for a rise. So I must face that with other accumulations during my hybernation. And now to lunch. & then to take tickets for Charlie Chaplin. And I’ve never recorded my request from Lady Oxford—that I shd. write an obituary of her writing; or my lunch there; & the little drawn up painted alert nervous brilliant woman, as hard as nails, but a good mimic."
1936.03.04,"Well, I’m almost through copying the raid scene, I shd. think for the 13th time. Then it will go tomorrow, & I shall have I think one days full holiday—if I dare—before re-reading. So I’m in sight of the end: that is in sight of the beginning of the other book which keeps knocking unmercifully at the door. Oh to be able once more to write freely every morning, spinning my own words afresh—what a boon—what a physical relief & rest, delight after these last months—since October year more or less—of perpetual compressing & re-writing always at that one book.

The Dolls House last night. Lydia very good; an interesting play, wh. throws light on some of my own efforts; but I wish I’d gone to Figaro instead. Not a good audience though, & I doubt if London will be as enthusiastic as Cambridge, which is Maynard’s pocket borough. Old Garnett there, like a sheep whose coat has been half torn off. No one else known to me."
1936.03.11,"Well yesterday I sent off 132 pages to Clark. We have decided to take this unusual course—that is to print it in galleys before L. sees it & send it to America. I’m thus feeling more at ease; but rather slack, as we went to Hedda Gabler last night with Nessa Duncan & Mrs Grant. I did not get the full impact: my mind too much set, I suppose, on my own corrections. Jean F. Robertson however was sinuous seductive sinister in a curious metallic old dress. Blue. A girl, who might have been an Ibsen lady, smiled at me. Now who is she? We cant place her. I am only writing this to mark time till lunch. Still, considering my languor, I think Ibsen comes pretty well out of it. (oh the rhythms that go on in my head. Thats one of the difficulties: I must break: want a usual [?] tone: must read Swift, I think). News is that we are going to stay one week end with David & Rachel: Morgan is again going on well. Nessa had trays of pure Chinese silk from Julian. She’s taking a room for Angelica. I’m pleased by the way that A. Bennett writing to his nephew seems, I think, to acquit me of authors’ vanity. “We got on fine, the day after I’d slanged her publicly in the E.S.…. We had a great pow-wow at Ethel Sands. Virginia’s all right..” This might be my epitaph I think.

I cant help feeling in the subcutaneous way one does feel such things that we are slightly on the up grade again: old Bloomsbury. Its rather a nicer feeling than being on the down grade perhaps. Nevinson, the painter, gave 50 centimes to the Fund to buy a Cézanne, in Roger’s memory. Now that sort of meanness makes me angry. Its all of a piece with Grigson &c. And heres Hampson coolly applying to L. who is rushed & pumped & milked by every ninny on the European situation—for help about his miserable little contracts. The European situation developed on Saturday. We were at Monks House. H⁠[itler]. has broken his word again, proposes to re-enter the League. But I’m too languid: shall even consider having an afternoon off."
1936.03.13,"Getting along rather better. So I steal 10 minutes before lunch. Never have I worked so hard at any book. My aim is not to alter a thing in proof. And I begin to suspect there’s something there—it hasn’t flopped yet. But enough of The Years—We walked round Ktn Gardens yesterday discussing politics. Aldous refuses to sign the latest manifesto because it approves sanctions. He’s a pacifist. So am I. Ought I to resign. L. says that considering Europe is now on the verge of the greatest smash for 600 years, one must sink private differences & support the League. He’s at a special L. Party meeting this morning. This is the most feverish overworked political week we’ve yet had. Hitler has his army on the Rhine. Meetings taking place in London. So serious are the French that they’re—the little Intelligence group—is sending a man to confer here tomorrow: a touching belief in English intellectuals. Another meeting tomorrow. As usual, I think Oh this will blow over. But its odd, how near the guns have got to our private life again. I can quite distinctly see them & hear a roar, even though I go on, like a doomed mouse, nibbling at my daily page. What else is there to do—except answer the incessant telephones, & listen to what L. says. Everything goes by the board. Happily we have put off all dinners & so on, on account of The Years. A very concentrated, laborious spring this is: with perhaps 2 fine days: crocuses out; then bitter black & cold. It all seems in keeping: my drudgery; our unsociability; the crisis; meetings; dark—& what it all means, no one knows. Privately … no, I doubt that I’ve seen anyone, or done anything but walk & work—walk for an hour after lunch—& so on. I must get back to H⁠[ogarth]. P⁠[ress]. MSS though."
1936.03.16,"I ought not to be doing this: but I cannot go on bothering with those excruciating pages any more. I shall come in at 3 & do some; & again after tea. For my own guidance: I have never suffered, since The Voyage Out, such acute despair on re-reading, as this time. On Saturday for instance: there I was, faced with complete failure: & yet the book is being printed. Then I set to: in despair: thought of throwing it away; but went on typing. After an hour, the line began to taughten. Yesterday I read it again; & I think it may be my best book. However … I’m only at the Kings death. I think the change of scene is whats so exhausting: the catching people plumb in the middle: then jerking off. Every beginning seems lifeless—& then I have to retype. I’ve more or less done 250: & theres 700 to do. A walk down the river & through Richmond Park did more than anything to pump blood in. Adrian though has had another queer seizure: suddenly became unconscious: & was then very sick. This reminds me of father falling down, & I thought he was on fire. Politics have slightly died down; We had a meeting on Saturday: I went to E. Bowen & sat in her glass shining ‘contemporary’ room. Like a French picture—2 ladies sitting looking at the Lake. She is much like a picture. We discussed poor Rose M.’s terrible flurry about E. not wanting to see her. R. stopped me in T⁠[orringto]⁠n Sqre to gasp out this heart cry Does Eth no longer want to know me? I went to fetch something she had said she was out … there was a party .. reviewing young men. In fact they were BBC young men. But what a state of mind this shows!"
1936.03.18,"It now seems to me so good—still talking about The Years—that I cant go on correcting. In fact I do think the scene at Witterings is about the best, in that line, I ever wrote. First proofs just come: so there’s a cold douche waiting me there. And I cant concentrate this morning—must make up Letter to an Englishman. I think, once more, that is the final form it will take, because after all separate letters break continuity so [text ends]

Another pause. This wandering comes from having Karin to dinner last night; & Kot before that; the same as ever: rather heavier, yellower; & then E⁠[lizabe]⁠th Williamson afterwards; & tho’ it wasn’t late, I felt like a wet towel, sitting there. My brain wont grip. Also it is the first day of Spring—hot: swarming. And, God damn these persistent old women, I must go to tea with Mrs Grosvenor. Oh what vampires they are—my blood must feed that old wretch. I dislike going—no hat, want to lie & dream after tea. Then theres Lady Simon tomorrow. And Rodmell…. Then one week of peace I will have before a week end at the Cecils.

But Karin was very nice: so brisk headed; & somehow sad; pathetic. Said she’d found Adrian unconscious & how awful it was. Yet they separated. A kind of suffering & capacity for something else in her, somehow, like a dog whose bones’ been snatched away, but no longer snarls. E.W. very much to the point too."
1936.03.20,"Book again very good: very bad yesterday. And what a horrid evening. First Lady Simon & Harry: then Raymond: then, Russian? No parents This was concealed. Very small, white, swollen hands: talked educated English—pattered. But a fact—She had to go. Knew she must go. Shuffled off to Bethnal Green. Used to make slips—pointing to L.’s waistcoat. Shook hands. And keep well she said longing for dinner, down I go to the Press, to see if my Macaulay’s come: & theres a tap on the window. I thought it was a little dressmakers apprentice come with my dress. But it was oh dear—a girl, fainting. Can I have a drop of water? She was hardly able to walk. Sat on the area steps while I got one. Then I took her in: got L.: hotted soup. But it was a horrible thing. Shed been walking all day to get work, had neuritis—cdnt sew, had had a cup of tea for breakfast, lived in one room alone in Bethnal Green. At first she cd hardly speak—“I’m hungry” she said. Gradually livened. Half dazed. Said You look like brother & sister, both have long noses. I’m a Jewess—a curious stress on the word as if a confession. So’s he I said. Then she perked up a little. But my God—no one to help her, she said. Friends? Oh they only think of enjoying themselves. May I take this home? taking a bun. We gave her tongue, 2 eggs, & 5/- Did you make this yourself—of the soup. Can you afford it—of the money. And a mere wisp—22—suffering. Never saw unhappiness, poverty so tangible. And felt its our fault. And she apologised. And what could we do. I shall stay in bed if I’m feeling bad & then go to the Labour Exchange. But I cant get any work. Think of one of our ‘class’: & this is what we exact.

Now its raining, & I suppose .. well, whats the use of thinking? As usual what was so vivid I saw it all the evening becomes stylised when I write. Some horror become visible: but in human form. And she may live 20 years … What a system."
1936.03.24,"A very good week end [at Rodmell]. Trees coming out, hyacinths, crocuses. Hot. The first spring week end. I slept. L. had a large [Labour Party] meeting. Clever people from Lewes. But I slept. Then we walked up to Rat Farm & looked for violets. Still spring here. Am tinkering—in a drowsy state. The approach of Easter that breaker up. Duncan going to Spain. Angelica coming back. We may do anything—perhaps go away with Morgan, whose book is out. Fat & blue. No time to read it yet. And I’m so absorbed in Two Guineas—thats what I’m going to call it. I must very nearly verge on insanity I think. I get so deep in this book I dont know what I’m doing. Find myself walking along the Strand talking aloud. Old Mrs W⁠[oolf]. in great spirits yesterday. Anxious to make out that Lady Oxford is not old: that a secluded life may be as good as a social one; & that parties are a natural pursuit for old women. So much of talk is always self-justification. But my five minutes is up, & I must go up. Miss Bernice Marks has been seeing Leonard."
1936.03.29,"Now its Sunday, & I’m still forging ahead. Done Eleanor in Oxford Street for the 20th time this morning. I’ve plotted it out now, & shall have done by Tuesday 7th April, I tell myself. And I cant help thinking its rather good. But no more of that. One bad head this week, lying prostrate. So I missed Nessa’s potters party, at which Angelica made a sensation in a new hat. And we put off going to the Cecils this week end: but went instead to Richmond yesterday; saw the lovely view, with a piece of deep green grass, the gasometer, & the clouds: looking towards Ealing L. said. So home; then to the Master Builder, where I did not like Lydia’s version; partly the ugly clothes; high boots, green skirt, red shawl. And she hasnt the compass; cant swing from the real to the poetic. Elizabeth [Bowen] Cameron was there with a cousin, who agreed. In fact they were very emphatic. Hated it. Asked us to meet the Master builder & drink beer at the Café Royal; but we refused, & came home; saw the Polish Prince coming, & only locked ourselves in just in time. L. has a sore throat this morning. We think of going, & high time too, to Monks House next Friday & digging ourselves in. Nessa & Angelica, Clive & Quentin will all be there [at Charleston].

I have left out Elizabeth Robins by the way—a great curse to me; for she came at a moment of high pressure; & I had to throw myself into her infinitely intense, exacting, pernickety demands. No, she must explain—in fact had come from Brighton to explain. She cannot go to see the M.B. but she does go to plays—thats what I cant deny—with a friend. But my sight is going—now this is a secret. I dont mean I’m going blind. But I must spare my eyes. And I have a book to write. I want to keep all my strength for that. Could you explain do you think? Yes. yes. and then there [’s] another thing, I could only tell you in confidence. I couldnt go & see her Hilda. I’m Hilda. I’m the person it was written for … All very intense. A small frozen humming bird—with rouged lips: intense blue eyes, very small, old; full of accents & intensities. We are to go to dinner or tea."
1936.04.01,"I forgot though to make L. an April fool, & he forgot too. The Ms. are lavender & silver. We went to tea with Gerald yesterday, which was like visiting an alligator in a tank, an obese & obsolete alligator, lying like our tortoises, half in & half out of the water. I wished I had gone to Downing St. to hear Baldwin on Newnham as I sat there in the very ugly de Vere Gardens room, with the dull covers, & the tea on wheeled waiters, & the old picture that Gerald bought 40 years ago at St. Ives over the fire. I doubt that he much enjoyed seeing us, or has any capacity for enjoying anything left. We talked publishers’ shop, & she—her name I dont know—was vivacious in the strained way of a woman whose life is empty & who has perpetually to animate her husband. She is ‘got up’ but elderly; shrivelled; rather a nice woman, I suspect, but discontented. And G. told me about his diseases, & threw cold water, sensible, business man’s very faded common sense—for he has failed as a business man—on all projects. Theres nothing in it—nothing in it, he kept saying. Also, nothing doing; nothing doing whatever. I think felt us perhaps more in the swim than himself. I doubt he has any sentiment about the past either: may like George’s sons—I don’t know. And keeps up with Sophie & Emma Vaughan. So we went & walked in the park. If I can do 25 pages daily I shall be done by Tuesday next. And then the proofs. How its to come out in May, God knows. But I no longer bother much: am doing the difficult North & Sara; but philosophically."
1936.04.09,"[Monks House]

Now will come the season of depression, after congestion suffocation. The last batch was posted to Clark at Brighton yesterday. L. is in process of reading. I daresay I’m pessimistic, but I fancy a certain tepidity in his verdict so far: but then its provisional. At any rate these are disgusting, racking at the same time enervated days, & must be thrown on the bonfire. The horror is that tomorrow, after this one windy day of respite—oh the cold North wind that has blown ravaging daily since we came, but I’ve had no ears, eyes, or nose: only making my quick transits from house to room, often in despair—after this one day’s respite, I say, I must begin at the beginning & go through 600 pages of cold proof. Why oh why? Never again, never again. No sooner have I written that, than I make up the first pages of Two Guineas, & begin a congenial ramble about Roger. But seriously I think this shall be my last ‘novel’. But then I want to tackle criticism too. Enough, though. The first task is to resume charge of life: to read Hogarth MSS. & to stir the waters. I’ve let them get a little stagnant, mildewed.

Dining at Charleston tonight, I’m glad to say. Clive’s article on the Q.M. to be discussed. We met Nessa & Angelica in Lewes: & A. looked like the heroine in a Turgenev novel, in her frogged dress & little cap. Judith Bagenal already a woman of 45 with 6 children: husband a clergyman, I think, or Lecturer at the London School of Economics.

I dont think I said we had taken Morgan to Abinger—a very very bitter cold day: his love, the stout policeman to see him off at Manchester Street. A silent drive, through suburbs, with raked roads: no view: all misted; then sharp to the right & left; up a lane, & there on a little hill was his house; & old Mrs F. columnar with the prominent grey eyes, the maid in apron & false teeth, the handy man & gardener in the distance, all there to welcome him. He has some nickname—“Tong?”—for his mother. And we had a look in at the scrupulous Victorian drawing room, with the silver kettle, & the Richmond drawings; one of Hannah More & Squirrel—& then left.

And then there was Colefax—yes, instantly on us, the first day we arrived, for lunch: in a black beret, & grey tweed coat; dried, like one of the hams in Flint’s shop [in Lewes]: not improved by sorrow I think, only posed. Poor woman, what a hard nature; so that to lose Arthur only liberates a little misty sentiment. And yet she’s brave, I think: but still the hostess, the aspiring, restless, dissatisfied—running, running, like a dog behind a carriage, that always goes too fast. And how she snaps at the other running dogs—Mrs Wigram, Madame de Margerie. We had polite conversation about notables over the fire, & then she left. Rolls Royce: going on to customers, I think."
1936.06.11,"[52 Tavistock Square]

I can only, after 2 months, make this brief note, to say at last after 2 months dismal & worse, almost catastrophic illness—never been so near the precipice to my own feeling since 1913—I’m again on top. I have to re-write, I mean interpolate & rub out most of The Years in proof. But I cant go into that. Can only do an hour or so. Oh but the divine joy of being mistress of my mind again! Back from MH. yesterday. Now I am going to live like a cat stepping on eggs till my 600 pages [of proof correcting] are done. I think I can—I think I can—but must have immense courage & buoyancy to compass it. This, as I say, my first voluntary writing since April 9th. after wh. I pitched into bed: then to Cornwall—no note of that; then back; saw Elly: then to M.H. Home yesterday for a fortnights trial. And the blood has mounted to my head. Wrote 1880 this morning."
1936.06.21,"After a week of intense suffering—indeed mornings of torture—& I’m not exaggerating—pain in my head—a feeling of complete despair & failure—a head inside like the nostrils after hay fever—here is a cool quiet morning again, a feeling of relief; respite: hope. Just done the Robsons: think it good.

I am living so constrainedly; so repressedly: I cant make notes of life. Everything is planned, battened down. I do ½ an hour down here; go up, often in despair, lie down; walk round the square: come back do another 10 lines. Then to Lords yesterday [MCC v. Oxford University]. Always with a feeling of having to repress; control. I see people lying on sofa between tea & dinner. Rose M⁠[acaulay]. E⁠[lizabe]⁠th Bowen. Nessa. Sat in the square last night. Saw the dripping green leaves. Thunder & lightning. Purple sky. N. & A⁠[ngelica]. discussing 4/8 time. Cats stealing round. L. dining with Tom & Bella. A very strange, most remarkable summer. New emotions: humility: impersonal joy: literary despair. I am learning my craft in the most fierce conditions. Really reading Flaubert’s letters I hear my own voice cry out Oh art! Patience. Find him consoling, admonishing. I must get this book quietly strongly daringly into shape. But it wont be out till next year. Yet I think it has possibilities, cd I seize them. I am trying to cut the characters deep in a phrase: to pare off & compact scenes; to envelop the whole in a medium."
1936.06.23,"A good day—a bad day—so it goes on. Few people can be so tortured by writing as I am. Only Flaubert I think. Yet I see it now, as a whole: I think I can bring it off, if I only have courage & patience: take each scene quietly: compose: I think it may be a good book. And then—oh when its finished!

Not so clear today, because I went to dentist & then shopped. My brain is like a scale: one grain pulls it down. Yesterday it balanced: today dips."
1936.10.30,"I do not wish for the moment to write out the story of the months since I made the last mark here. I do not wish, for reasons I cannot now develop, to analyse that extraordinary summer. It will be more helpful & healthy for me to write scenes; to take up my pen & describe actual events: good practice too for my stumbling & doubting pen. Can I still ‘write’? That is the question, you see. And now I will try to prove if the gift is dead, or dormant.

Tuesday 27th. On Tuesday I went to tea with Sibyl. It was a very windy wet evening; leaves swirling along the pavement, people holding their hats & skirts. An oldish shabby man in seedy day clothes opened the door. He might have been a bailiff but was I suppose an auctioneer’s assistant. “Lady Colefax?” I said. He shook his head. He thought I had come to see the furniture. Come this way, he said, & led me, or rather disappeared in front of me, into the servants quarters—that unknown region where so many meals have been prepared, when Fielding [maid] issued, so discreet, respectable & cordial. Now there were tables set out with dinner services, with bunches of knives & forks, all ticketed & labelled. Fielding came out from the hidden premises, still in her grey dress & apron, but looking blurred & flustered. “I dont know where to put you” she said, in an agitated way, & murmuring something about finding her ladyship, about people being still here, led me finally with apologies to the dining room. That brown festive & somehow succulent room was also up for sale. The walnut table had its ticket & the little glass trees on the mantelpiece & the chandelier. It is a nice warm room I thought sitting down on one of the brown chairs, & thinking how very shy I had been there; yet how glad after, that I had overcome the terror of hair & clothes, & how nimble my tongue became, & how little alarming it was to talk to Sir Arthur on my right, or George Moore or Noel Coward on my left. Yes, I had enjoyed myself in a mixed way there—the feeling was compounded of relief to find so little to frighten & of pleasure to find so much to say—when in peered, in the tentative calculating way of a stranger looking at things he may want to buy, an obviously alien gentleman: the sort of man in a brown overcoat that one sees at sales, but not at parties at Argyll House. And no sooner had he begun sizing up the furniture than two fashionable, dimly recognisable women, peered in; one of whom, the smaller, the vaguely pretty & familiar, recognised me to the extent of smiling & half extending her hand; but clearly my name escaped her. And hers only tentatively seemed to me to be Ava Wigram. How sad—how very sad—she said (words I had used to the tremulous & flustered Fielding who seemed, as she agreed, about to burst into tears). ‘Yes its sad, very sad..’ I echoed. And then she asked, had I come to see the things? for I was sitting in my chair as if waiting. No, I’ve come to see Sibyl I said .. & they prowled round: Ava I think surprised, perhaps displeased, at this assumption of superior intimacy. They were tentatively wandering, touching this & that, into the next room, when Sibyl herself peered in: hurried, furtive; summoned me, as if she lifted me, secretly, to some private assignation out of a world now all formal, no longer friendly. And so we crossed into the drawing room, where, with a sigh & some explanations, she shut the door & sank on the sofa.

My bare hand rested for a moment on her bare hand. This is sympathy, I felt: but it must not be emphasised or prolonged. She looked like a dried up bird; marks were cut on either side of her nose. Deep clefts ran under her eyes. But of course she talked facts. Who was that, in the dining room? Ava Wigram. Oh dear—she saw me then? No I think not.

But Sibyl, you must rest?

My dear, how can I rest? The Dr & surgeon said to me You must now take 6 months holiday. But I’m not Greta Garbo … Where’s tea?

Tea, bread & butter & gingerbread, was brought.

No, everyone says Fielding is a help. I can tell you the truth. I’ve lived for 35 years with the Irish. She laughs. Then she cries.

But Sibyl, I said, trying to formulate some phrase of affection or regret, you have given … yes, passing this house, I’ve often thought that—seeing the lights.

Oh, in those days I was a millionaire. What could I do but give?

Then compliments to me, which I disdained. You’ve given to living people .. I’ve seen Arnold Bennett, George Moore, Noel Coward….

Door opens …

Lady Mary Cholmondeley my lady.

Who? I dont know any such person.. Excuse me, I must go & see for myself …

And she wont wear spectacles, because of her appearance. I say I dont mind wearing them all day .. (but she doesnt). What were we saying? Yes, those you’ve named, they were the people I like to think of … Glad you’ve had some tea—this is wretched. No, I cant talk to anyone. I go on. I cant let myself talk, or I should sink into such depths … I should never recover. There are my old Aunts, the Wedgwoods. They knew us when we were young—when we were engaged. Yes. I go on, from thing to thing.

In comes Ava & the other woman. Society small talk. We shall see you again….

My dear that woman. I dislike her.

I too, because she makes me dislike her: I dont like disliking people.

Thats true. Stories of Ava’s meanness about the Lyttons & the house in North Street. A story about the house in North Street, how she got it for 700 less. And when I woke from the anaesthetic, Michael said to me the house is gone. I said Well, its not our year, thats all about it. Its not our year. After that I got the house for 700 less than I offered—because of the Lyttons, & its been lived in by a madman, its filthy. No, I’ve always wanted to be able to say if theres anyone you want to meet, I’ll arrange it. I wanted to bring people together … Now I’m going to do two things. To collect an anthology of love poems. Isnt it odd? When I was a girl of 18 I read a poem & thought I understood it all. At 18—knowing nothing of life. I’m going to collect an anthology for lovers. And in the nursing home I went through letters—little notes from A⁠[rnold]. B⁠[ennett]. from W⁠[aker]. Raleigh.

To turn from dialogue to narrative.

She talked in a scattered nervous way, like a hen fluttering over the edge of an abyss. A brave hen. Her eyes were bright. And they say now that she has cancer in her breast. Nor could I always distinguish between the pose—I am going to show myself poetic & unworldly to Virginia—& the genuine gallantry. She has been too long exposed to artificial light to do without it. She is like a bat in a bright room when she is in darkness. She is blinded by darkness; I mean when she is alone, without the stimulus & direction of other peoples views she is uncertain. Flounders. With us it is just the opposite. But whether I imagined it or not, I still felt something genuinely rising from the depths in her: a desire to fight her adversity, a momentary desire to break down; but then she was up again & off again. When the door opened & Fielding croaked out “The car, m’lady” she was glad of the call to action & we swept through the wind swept fluttering lighted streets, sitting together in the Rolls Royce while she told stories, adequately indeed rather brilliantly, of George Moore & Wells, of Henry James & Carrie Balestier [Mrs Rudyard Kipling]. The machine had got going again, after its momentary paralysis, & she jumped out at Mount Street to pay a business visit. Then she was going to a concert & then to have a supper party

But in this hasty account I have forgotten to describe my farewell to Argyll House, as I walked with her out of the double doors, down the little path, & stood for a moment at the wrought iron gate.
"
1936.11.03,"Miracles will never cease—L. actually likes The Years! He thinks it so far—as far as the wind chapter [1908]—as good as any of my books. I will put down the actual facts. On Sunday I started to read the proofs. When I had read to the end of the first section I was in despair: stony but convinced despair. I made myself yesterday read on to Present Time. When I reached that landmark I said This is happily so bad that there can be no question about it. I must carry the proofs, like a dead cat, to L. & tell him to burn them unread. This I did. And a weight fell off my shoulders. That is true. I felt relieved of some great pack. It was cold & dry & very grey & I went out & walked through the graveyard with Cromwell’s daughters Tomb down through Grays Inn along Holborn & so back. Now I was no longer Virginia, the genius, but only a perfectly insignificant yet content—shall I call it spirit? a body? And very tired. Very old. But at [the] same time content to go on these 100 years with Leonard. So we lunched, in a constraint: a grey acceptance; & I said to L. I will write to Richmond & ask for books to review. The proofs will cost I suppose between 2 & 300 pounds which I will pay out of my hoard. As I have 700 this will leave 400. I was not unhappy. And L. said he thought I might be wrong about the book. Then ever so many strange men arrived: Mr Mumford, mahogany coloured lean, with a very hard bowler & a cane; whom I put in the drawing room with a cigarette; Mr —— very heavy & large, who said Pardon me & knocked at the door. And Lord & Lady Cecil rang up to ask us to lunch to meet the Spanish Ambassador. (I am making up 3 Guineas) Then, after tea, we went to the Sunday Times book show. How stuffy it was! How dead I felt—Oh how infinitely tired! And Miss White came up, a hard little woman, with a cheery wooden face, & talked about her book & reviews. And then Ursula Strachey came across from Duckworths & said you dont know who I am? And I remembered the moonlit river. And then Roger Senhouse tapped me on the shoulder. We went home, & L. read & read & said nothing: I began to feel actively depressed; yet could make up The Years differently—I’ve thought of a scheme for another book—it should be told in the first person.—Would that do as a form for Roger?—& I fell into one of my horrid heats & deep slumbers, as if the blood in my head were cut off. Suddenly L. put down his proof & said he thought it extraordinarily good—as good as any of them. And now he is reading on, & tired out with the exertion of writing these pages I’m going up to read the Italian book."
1936.11.04,"L. who has now read to the end of 1914 still thinks it extraordinarily good: very strange; very interesting; very sad. We discussed my sadness .. But my difficulty is this: I cannot bring myself to believe that he is right. It may be simply that I exaggerated its badness, & therefore he now, finding it not so bad, exaggerates its goodness, if it is to be published, I must at once sit down & correct: how can I? Every other sentence seemed to me bad. But I am shelving the question till he has done, which should be tonight. Now I must copy out my Daily Worker article; then E. Watson is coming: then Ka to lunch. It is one of the most puzzling situations I have ever been in. Of course we might appeal to Morgan."
1936.11.05,"The miracle is accomplished. L. put down the last sheet about 12 last night; & could not speak. He was in tears. He says it is “a most remarkable book—he likes it better than The Waves.” & has not a spark of doubt that it must be published. I, as a witness, not only to his emotion, but to his absorption, for he read on & on, can’t doubt his opinion: what about my own? Anyhow the moment of relief was divine. I hardly know yet if I’m on my heels or head—so amazing is the reversal since Tuesday morning. I have never had such an experience before. Now it is pouring & we go down to Lewes for the fireworks. Eth Watson & Ka yesterday & to the Book Show & walk along V⁠[ictoria?] Street & so on."
1936.11.09,"I must make some resolutions about this book. I find it extremely difficult. I get into despair. It seems so bad. I can only cling to L.’s verdict. Then I get distracted: I tried, as an anodyne, to take up an article; a memoir: to review a book for the Listener. They make my mind race. I must fix it upon The Years. I must do my proofs & send them off. I must fix my mind on it all the morning. I think the only way is to do that, & then let myself do something else between tea & dinner. But immerse in The Years all the morning—nothing else. If the chapter is difficult, concentrate for a short time. Then write here. But dont dash off into other writing till after tea. When it is done, we can always ask Morgan."
1936.11.10,"On the whole it has gone better this morning. Its true my brain is so tired of this job it aches after an hour or less. So I must dandle it, & gently immerse it. Yes I think its good; in its very difficult way.

Yesterday Barnes came to tea; a very white & black professional young man. Strained: on a leash: much burdened with his job; & the moral strain of keeping the BBC up to Cambridge standards. A nice old fashioned Cambridge young man.

Before that I met L. at the Red Lion & down came Kingsley looking, I thought pale lead coloured, ravaged, unwholesome. My pity of course came to the surface; & of course he asked me to review Chesterton’s Au⁠[tobiograph]⁠y wh. he held in his hand. No doubt I could make a living that way if I chose. In fact the old fountains only want this paving stone of a book off them to spring up. I wonder if anyone has ever suffered so much from a book, as I have from The Years. Once out I will never look at it again. Its like a long childbirth. Think of that summer, every morning a headache, & forcing myself into that room in my nightgown; & lying down after a page: & always with the certainty of failure. Now that certainty is mercifully removed to some extent. But now I feel I dont care what anyone says so long as I’m rid of it. And for some reason I feel I’m respected & liked. But this is only the haze dance of illusion, always changing. Never write a long book again. Yet I feel I shall write more fiction—scenes will form. But I am tired this morning: too much strain & racing yesterday. The Daily Worker article. Madrid not fallen. Chaos. Slaughter. War surrounding our island. Mauron over, & G. Brennan. Dine with Adrian tonight."
1936.11.11,"Armistice day—completely forgotten, by us. I’m going along quietly, rather ashamed of my extreme deliberation. Cant review Miss Weeton either. Joe [Ackerley] will only allow me 800 words of unsigned; 1500 of signed. An amusing illustration of the virtues of capitalism. Its the advertisement, not the article, they want. And its the advertisement I dont want. But anyhow the book is bad mostly; & to compress Miss W. into 800 words would not be worth doing in the eyes of eternal truth, or any other. No. The desire to review dies out in me when I have the book. Rather an interesting experiment in its way. Again I am confirmed in my project of some private sheet.

Dined with Adrian last night: a solid man called Rickman there. A. & K⁠[arin] very busy & friendly & both enjoying life more than they did, as I think. A. very tenuous & frail & distinguished. On the whole well in the thick of things, not so aloof as of old. A good deal of p⁠[sycho]. a⁠[nalysis]. talked; & I liked it. A mercy not always to talk politics. L. by the way put down Bertie’s book just before we went, & said “Now my mind is made up.” He had become an isolationist. I feel I was, for other reasons, these many months: but for different reasons—those I want to explore. But not here. R⁠[ickman].’s family had always lived in Lewes & he remembered the violent Guy Fox days, when you had to wear goggles & wet straw. K. is pleased to make £800: a very dissatisfied woman, since she always emphasises this fact. But I’m no longer so censorious either. Have done no pages, & those the worst. Or so I hope."
1936.11.13,"Another moment of depression, largely caused by dining with Alix & James last night I think."
1936.11.17,"Lord Cecil to tea. He has grown large, but still has the angular twisting movements of a thin man. His face is moon shaped; brown & pink—it used to be lank & cadaverous. He is more genial. Indeed, much expanded, & at his ease. A man of the world. A little frieze of still brown hair, very fine, at the back of his head. Bright merry eyes. In good spirits, in spite of the world. But he said, I think there is more vitality both in men & in institutions, than one expects. We have failed (the L. of N.) no matter we must try again. I’m convinced by Winston. An alliance of France England & Russia. B. Russell—insane! Complete insanity! To tell us we are to submit to Hitler! Do what Hitler tells us! What do you think, Sally? Caressed Sally [dog] with his long pointed fingers. Had been speaking in M⁠[ancheste]⁠r. When he repeated B⁠[ertie].s arguments people’s faces fell flat. The L. Mayor of M. said to him We want Dalton as leader. Atlee’s not a colourful man. Said the peoples political sense is unerring & right. One working man said to another, Vansittart has far too much say in things. Quite true. V. ruled Simon. Simon the worst F⁠[oreign]. S⁠[ecretary]. ever been. Hoare a complete disappointment. They shd. have put in Halifax. Not a genius but courageous. Eden young, poor, ambitious: his only interest politics. Human nature being what it is, therefore … No, has no opinion of Eden. Shd. have resigned. The country sees through him. Very difficult to know when to resign, as I found. Phil Baker shd. do half what he does, & should drink wine. Everyone loves him—the boys at the Treasury will do anything for him. But dictates letters as he drives.

Had been taken to see Mussolini. An absurd fellow. There he sat at the end of a very long room, making eyes at me (he made eyes). That doesnt impress me. The F.S. should submit his facts to the P⁠[ermanen]⁠t. officials but shd. control them. They write jargon, as my father used to say. Gave the impression of extreme well being: a saucepan gently simmering on the comfort & consideration of 70 years. Best type of Eng. Governing class I suppose: the flower of 19th Century civilisation: urbane, broadminded, kind & hopeful. Much more cheerful than the intellectuals. Is it that he has not so much mind? Compare him with Bertie or Aldous. Inclined to mock the earnest intellectual. Very nice of him to come of course. I was flattered. And it was raining & he went home in the Tube. Very poor he said. Had sacrificed 5 or 6000 a year when he gave up the bar. Cdn’t afford a car. Anything else? Knows human nature from one angle. Likes it. Not much deluded I shd. say. Less of a fanatic, or more concealed than of old. Winston on side of Franco, because he has friends in that camp. But the people dont respect Winston. He changes his mind & policy. Baldwin a complete failure. He shd. have resigned when Hoare did. Awful Mansion House speech. No leaders. Young men on L⁠[abour]. side kept back till theyre over 40. I wanted to ask him to call me Virginia but refrained. Thats about all. And Chapman coming today. Mauron dined on Sunday; another nice man. telling humorous stories of Roger: his car: Josette."
1936.11.24,"Here I am cleft as usual in my little stick. So free & so cabined. The future. What I’m to write. Yes I think I can write &c. Began 3 Gs. yesterday. & liked it. Today the old symptoms—t. of l., cant get rid of it—the swollen veins—the tingling; the odd falling; feeling of despair. Brain not fully blooded. Hot & cold. I’m glad, how odd, that I’m lunching with Clive to meet Mme de Polignac. That I’ve a new black felt hat, bought yesterday after having Ethel S. to lunch. Glad too that Helen Anrep is dining with me: that I shant be alone, alone I fall into those trances, comas, which are I suppose t. of l: but so frustrating [?], when I want to be clear & to read. A curious throbbing this disease produces. But I’ve been on the whole vigorous & cheerful since the wonderful revelation of L.’s that night. How I woke from death—or non being—to life! What an incredible night—what a weight rolled off!

Yeats’ anthology out. Am I jealous? No: but depressed to feel I’m not a poet. Next time I shall be one. And I’ve touched ground. Whatever happens I dont think I can now be destroyed. Only work work is essential. Roger…. &c.

Very cold & dank. We came up on Sunday through the fog. Figures suddenly emerged. The kind man with a paper. I walked by his side leading the car. It crashed into a wall. The wing buckled. Walked by the kerb all through Wimbledon & Wandsworth. The kerb ended. Here I was lost in a trackless mist. & so on & on. A little boy emerged—a street ruffian. People lined the pavement watching the lost cars. Another man led us; offered me a rest. In the car I looked & found the paper was The Blackshirt. Out again. Just as we thought we must find a garage & come home by tube a bus driver told us that in 200 yards it would be clear. So, miraculously, it was. Glass clear—lit up, & so home.

I have also written my memoir [Am I a Snob?]. Indeed The Years has taught me something about scenes. But are they worth doing? I want a spell of private writing—with Nessa perhaps. Dotty much praised. My hackles rise—that she shd. lend herself to puffing, shd. print her photograph. Old E. says this is a detail. I daresay she’s right—with all her faults she has scope, proportion. She touched me by giving me her little notebook of the woman in the train, well bound, with an inscription. When I’m low, how this touches me. But I will not be low. Up & off again, like the gull in the poem. Meredith’s. I wish I cd. invent a way of dashing down criticism, as I do here."
1936.11.25,"L.’s birthday. Lunch with Clive. The Princess, a waxy solid handsome lady with kind eyes. Not formidable. Ros. Eddy Ld Berners. Talk all very brilliant. The usual sense of having done with that when it was half over. And the different changes of light. The intimacy. Then the superficiality. Very cold. An eyeless grey day. The same subjects recur. Sybil. Ld. B’s jokes, the same. Ros. muffled & tentative. I, rather too erratic. The P⁠[rincess]. out of things. And I must lunch with her & Ethel tomorrow."
1936.11.27,"Lunch, again with the Princess, at Claridges, where in all my 54 years I have never been. Like a private house—sumptuous yet refined. The French—little Polignac niece—a singer: Nadia Boulanger, the Conductor—wear black. Sir R. Storrs. Like George [Duckworth]: stolid, second rate, a snob, & very vain. Also disapproving. The genial man gone cold, like red beef congealed. And what a lot to eat! Half left on our plates. Ethel talking with admirable racy English. The smart white faced lady in pearls listening. How she went to prison. The Ps not very vital. Boulanger the one I liked—a vital shabby governess type. French, very, so erect & smart, not dowdy, only shabby: one cheap brooch in the right place. Little P. devitalised, pretty, said F. women must have men. B⁠[oulanger] says they rule France through influence. Its true they cant get passports officially: but unofficially get everything run everything. Storrs masculine. Only has wine at night. Reads seasonally: Dante: Homer: Shakespeare. K. Martin, approached by one of the King’s circle was asked to write an article, revealing the facts from the King’s side. Is writing his memoirs—a conceited man—a non-entity I think, but wants to come here. Why? P. tactfully puts a shade over Ethel. Ethel the only one with brains (except B.) (I think I must read Dante of a morning.) So not a very exciting or formidable affair. I walked home; in my black velvet; not a bad day. Happy to be so unconcerned.

Then he was told to wait. Finally he came out after the great splash with a very inaccurate version. The King’s men told him in strict secrecy about the sexual difficulty. L. has a confidential story about the King & Mrs Simpson, told him in secret by K. Martin. Dined alone, read Sir T. Browne’s letters. I am getting back to solid food again. My wits fritter easily, but not so easily. I must work, as I told Sally G. who suffers I think considerably & shd. break off her engagement instead of being psychoanalysed. Ott. after tea—& am I to tell her about Stephen Tennant & Lytton’s letters? She will erect herself & puff out her cobra hood if I do."
1936.11.29,"On the contrary, she was attenuated, & abashed. She put up no fight; was all shyness & anguish, & agreed with me about S.T. & the letters. Only had forgotten there was anything intimate. St. came in by chance; had a little rucksack. So she took pity on him &c. Age is coming on her. much shrivelled; all the down worn off."
1936.11.30,"There is no need whatever in my opinion to be unhappy about The Years. It seems to me to come off at the end. Anyhow to be a taut real strenuous book: with some beauty & poetry too. A full packed book. Just finished it; & feel a little exalted. Its different from the others of course: has I think more ‘real’ life in it; more blood & bone. But anyhow, even if there are appalling watery patches, & grinding at the beginning, I dont think I need lie quaking at nights. I think I can feel assured. This I say sincerely to myself; to hold to myself during the weeks of dull anticipation. Nor need I care much what people say. In fact I hand ray compliment to that terribly depressed woman, myself, whose head ached so often: who was so entirely convinced a failure; for in spite of everything I think she brought it off, & is to be congratulated. How she did it, with her head like an old cloth I dont know. But now for rest: & Gibbon."
1936.12.07,"Now, we are—without a King? With a Queen? What? The Simpson affair is on the surface. It was on Wednesday 2nd Dec that the Bishop commented on the Kings lack of religion. On Thursday all the papers, The Times & D⁠[aily] T⁠[elegraph]. very discreetly, mentioned some, domestic difficulties; others Mrs Simpson. All London was gay & garrulous—not exactly gay, but excited. We cant have a woman Simpson for Queen, that was the sense of it. She’s no more royal than you or me, was what the grocer’s young woman said. But today, before the PM. makes his announcement to the House, we have developed a strong sense of human sympathy; we are saying Hang it all—the age of Victoria is over. Let him marry whom he likes. In the Beefsteak Club however only Lord Onslow & Clive take the democratic view. Harold [Nicolson] is glum as an undertaker, & so are the other nobs. They say Royalty is in Peril. The Empire is divided. In fact never has there been such a crisis. That I think is true. Spain, Germany, Russia—all are elbowed out. The marriage stretches from one end of the paper to another. Pictures of the D. of York & the Princesses fill every cranny. Mrs Simpson is snapped by lime light at midnight as she gets out of her car. Her luggage is also photographed. Parties are forming. The different interests are queueing up behind Baldwin, or Churchill. Mosley is taking advantage of the crisis for his ends. In fact we are all talking 19 to the dozen; & it looks as if this one little insignificant man had moved a pebble wh. dislodges an avalanche. Things—empires, hierarchies—moralities—will never be the same again. Yet today there is a certain feeling that the button has been pressed too hard: emotion is no longer so liberally forthcoming. And the King may keep us all waiting, while he sits, like a naughty boy in the nursery, trying to make up his mind.

Coming past the Palace last night there were crowds waiting in the cold—it is very cold—cant write—with eyes fixed on the windows. Two or 3 lights were burning in upper windows."
1936.12.08,"Now what am I to do about these proofs? send them off? But how exercise patience & courage? What shall I write? Sketches I think …"
1936.12.10,"The chops & changes of the Crisis wd. be worth investigating, had I time. It is a foggy cold morning, as damp & dismal as can be. I have just turned on my electric light. Has the King abdicated? I think so. At 3.30. Baldwin will speak. Each day has been different—jud⁠[g]⁠ing from the papers & shop sampling. The Times reiterates No one has hurried the King. We sympathise but … it is for his Majesty to decide. The Rothermere press & Churchill, who was shouted down in the House, have subsided. No more talk of coercing the King. Mrs Simpson at Cannes says she is ready to withdraw from an unhappy & untenable position. Cars, black cars, drive constantly to & from Fort Belvedere where the King is immured, some (Labour Party gossips) say drinking: the papers say consulting a vet, about a dog who has hurt her paw. Baldwin goes down constantly: the King is rude & drunk. Last night the Queen & Pss Mary went. A brake laden with luggage was seen to leave the fort. No royal engagements are kept. It is a time of mourning. The Q. visits old curiosity shops & is said to have bought a gold frog. Meanwhile ‘the people’ have swung round to a kind of sneering contempt. “Ought to be ashamed of himself” the tobacconists young woman said. Timmy the Q’s sec: told George Bergen that abdication is settled. Maynard says no: the difficulties, legal &c, are too great. Bergen says Timmy says he is now merely haggling for a sufficient income. K. George left him nothing; & he has lavished money & jewels on Simpson. All the royal dukes are in & out & the Chancellors & solicitors with their black boxes. Last night Mary [Hutchinson] on the telephone said that to her certain (through Lady Diana [Cooper] & Lord Brownlow) knowledge the King some weeks ago, finding Mrs S. cooling, became mad with rage; also was entirely possessed against all friends advice, of some bourgeois (her word) obsession about marriage: insisted, after 2 years of license, that the marriage service was essential—though Mrs S. did not wish it—& went to Baldwin. Baldwin, Mary says, then learnt of the situation for the first time. The rest followed. She says all his friends think him insane. He could have gone on with Mrs S. as mistress till they both cooled: no one objected. Now he has probably lost her, & thrown away the Kingdom & made us all feel slightly yet perceptibly humiliated. Its odd, but so I even feel it. Walking through Whitehall the other day, I thought what a Kingdom! England! And to put it down the sink … Not a very rational feeling. Still it is what the Nation feels. The Times is discreetly sarcastic at his expense: has a curl of disdain in its tone; quotes, in its leader this morning, letters which beginning earlier in the week with hysterical sympathy, now say Our sons & brothers gave their wives & lovers & also their lives for the country. And cant the King do even this—? But everything now hardens into the certainty that the King cant do this, & will follow his luggage to Cannes. Rather an ignominious flight—I feel again. He will live in America, Bergen says, Timmy says: & the Q. wants him to abdicate. I gather that Lady Diana, en route for [Fort] Belvedere, called on Jack [Hutchinson] in his nursing home, to ask his advice. He advised that the King should professedly give her up: abstain from her society for one year; & then revert to her. But apparently the King’s little bourgeois demented mind sticks fast to the marriage service. Mrs S. gives him, unlike all the other mistresses, physical relief: her time synchronises with him. And it is said that she is now a little cooling; so what will they do in Kentucky? I am reluctant to end this page, because it is I think the last entry I shall make in this book on the subject of Edward the Eighth. If I write tomorrow, it will be in the reign, I suppose of Albert the First—& he’s not, so Mary says, a popular choice. Let it be. This afternoon I shall go down in the fog to the hub of the universe, & hang about the H. of C."
1936.12.10,"This is the first hour, or since it is 5.30, & the abdication was announced at 4, the first hour & a half, of the new reign. Yes, I thought, its silly buying sachets at Stags & Mantles: I will go to Westminster. A bus took me to the top of Whitehall. There traffic was turned off & I dismounted. Whitehall was full of shuffling & trampling. People going both ways. Not a thick crowd—a moving crowd. A very beautiful yellow brown light: dry pavements: still lamps lit. Lines of light at Parliament Sqre. & the houses of Parliament in silhouette. The lamp burning in the watch tower. Opposite the Horse Guards there was Ottoline, black, white, red lipped coming towards me. She intercepted my impulse Bob raising his eyebrows & qualifying in his usual way. to escape. We turned & walked on. Then Bob Trevelyan loomed up. We three stood & talked. They said it was dreadful … I’m very sad … Its a pity. Has he abdicated? I asked. No, but they say he will. No one knew if he had or hadn’t. A stir of uneasy feeling .. most people half sad, yet also ashamed, yet also excited. Bob left us, not before tho’ he’s hummed & hawed & said that Hawtrey didnt think so badly of the D. also, Under wh. King Bezonian? Speak or die? of York. Then on we wandered down the yellow brown avenue. We looked up at the beautiful carved front of—what office? I dont know. Thats the window out of which Charles the First stepped when he had his head cut off said Ottoline, pointing to the great lit up windows in their frame of white stone. So my mother always told me. I felt I was walking in the 17th Century with one of the courtiers; & she was lamenting not the abdication of Edward—still though people shuffled this way & that—but the execution of Charles. Its dreadful, dreadful, she kept saying. Of course Portland’s glad he should go. Poor silly little boy—He always lost his temper. No one could ever tell him a thing he disliked. But to throw it away…. Still he hadn’t yet, so far as we knew, thrown it away. ‘It’ seemed then, looking at the curved street, & at the red & silver guards drawn up in the court-yard with the Park & the white government buildings behind, very stately, very lovely, very much the noble & severe aristocratic Stuart England .. However, nothing seemed to happen. And she had a tea party: so we hailed a taxi. Have you any news? the man said. No. I dont know .. What do you think? I say he should. We dont want a woman thats already had 2 husbands & an American when there [are] so many good English girls .. We were thus driving & talking when a newspaper car drove by with the word Abdication very large on a placard. It stopped near us; & the first papers in the bale were bought by Ottoline & me.

This is the first moment of the new reign, I said to Milly, at the open door of number 10: but she was agitated because some unexpected visitor—a man in a coat—had come—"
1936.12.10,"Then we had the Broadcast. “Prince Edward speaking from Windsor Castle”—as the emotional butler announced. Upon which, with a slight stammer at first, in a steely strained voice, as if he were standing with his back against the wall, the King (but that is already vanishing & attaching itself to York) began: “At long last.. I can speak to you ….. The woman I love … I who have none of those blessings…” Well, one came in touch with human flesh, I suppose. Also with a set pigheaded steely mind … a very ordinary young man; but the thing had never been done on that scale. One man set up in the Augusta Tower at Windsor addressing the world on behalf of himself & Mrs Simpson. Out in the All the omnibuses were empty Square there was complete emptiness. All the life had been withdrawn to listen, to judge. Miss Strachan [clerk] wdn’t listen, for fear of sympathising. And then Edward went on in his steely way to say the perfectly correct things, about the Constitution, the P. Minister, her majesty my mother. Finally he wound up, God Save the King with a shout; after which I heard his sigh go up, a kind of whistle. Then silence. Complete silence. Then Mr Hibbert saying. And now we shut down. Good night everybody. Goodnight; & we were tucked up in our beds."
1936.12.30,"There in front of me lie the proofs—the galleys—to go off today .. a sort of stinging nettle that I cover over. Nor do I wish even to write about it here.

A divine relief has possessed me these last days—at being quit of it—good or bad. And, for the first time since February I shd. say my mind has sprung up like a tree shaking off a load. And I’ve plunged into Gibbon & read & read, for the first time since Feb. I think. Now for action & pleasure again & going about. I cd. make some interesting perhaps valuable notes, on the absolute necessity for me of work. Always to be after something. I’m not sure that the intensiveness & exclusiveness of writing a long book is a possible state: I mean, if even in future I do such a thing—& I doubt it—I will force myself to vary it with little articles. Anyhow, now I am not going to think can I write? I am going to sink into unselfconsciousness & work: at Gibbon first: then a few little articles for America; then {{Roger/3 Guineas}} Which of the 2 comes first, how to dovetail, I dont know. Anyhow even if The Years is a failure, I’ve thought considerably; & collected a little hoard of ideas. Perhaps I’m now again on one of those peaks where I shall write 2 or 3 little books quickly: & then have another break. At least I feel myself possessed of skill enough to go on with. No emptiness.

& in proof of this will go in, get my Gibbon notes & begin a careful sketch of the article."
1937.01.10,"Another windless perfectly brilliant day. And Tommie is dead & buried yesterday, just as Clive was saying that no one had died lately. Also there’s Tonks dead in Chelsea. But Tommie’s death is a queer piece of work. We said on the whole perhaps it was a good thing, because for the past 3 or 4 years we had scarcely seen him: when we did he seemed ravaged by his own misery; couldn’t work, had been a failure; tore everyone & everything to bits in a kind of egotistic rage. Rosamund L. said he would sit on the lawn there by the hour denouncing women, complaining of his own lot. And he had grown immensely fat, white unwholesome looking, & was said to drink.

Duncan said he spent most of his time in the public houses near Tottenham Court Road, drinking. And Julia said no one could live with him, though she loved him. Everybody said one thing or another, as if he had cocked a snook at them & gone off. My own intercourse with him broke over that bust, when I took a shudder at the impact of his neurotic clinging persistency, & perhaps behaved, though I didn’t think so at the time, unreasonably, perversely. But he was such an egotist; such a man for confiding, & getting wound up in the miserable intricacies of his own psychology. I remember his launching out on the history of his own suffering, which began, of course, with his mother & father, misunderstanding him as a child. Then there was Garrow’s death; then the difficulties with Julia; how she fell in love with someone; how he still loved her. But the odd thing was that he had, years ago, great sensibility; a human charm, & sympathy—for instance when Duncan was ill at Cassis—I remember how he came into the drawing room at 37 [Gordon Square] with his arms open: Nessa kissing him in tears. And then when Carrington killed herself he came round that evening to break the news so that I shouldn’t get the shock first hand. Yes. I remember his curious squashed face, his suppleness, something eager & friendly & warm, quivering about him. Here he sat in the drawing room, when we lit the stove for the first time & the room was full of smoke: & he talked about me then: my work; not himself. He was extremely loquacious. Anything set him off. And he had a great gift for making people love him: Angus, Eddy, Barbara. But there was something twisted, deformed in him: some shudder & profound distaste, & uneasiness. Lately he had tried, I think, living alone in the country; didn’t like it; used to haunt public houses; deserted the respectable. N. & D. say they hadn’t seen him for a long time. And then he catches some germ, goes to a nursing home in Boscombe, from the [Augustus] Johns where he was staying; the only person he wanted to see was Oliver [Strachey]: & so died aged 35. A tragic, wasted life: something wrong in it; & wrong that we shouldn’t feel it more Yet one does, by fits & starts, this very fine spring morning.

Adrian, who rang up, said it was a very good thing his death. That he was in a hopeless state. He had not heard of the death, only had overheard someone say “Poor Tommie”.

I have scribb⁠[l]⁠ed this down, because it is an off morning. I am trying to screw myself to send an article to the N.S. on fishing. My Gibbon wants polishing; & I’ve got out of the mood. So let me go on to Elizabeth Robins & Octavia Wilberforce, before Quentin & Angelica come to our last roast turkey.

They live in one of those rounded houses in Brighton—Montpelier Crescent—a shaped crescent; a solid, clean, rather unsophisticated house. Miss R. sat alone in her own room, a back room, with well polished tables, rather solid books, covers on things, a sketch of W. Wilberforce over little glass stands for table legs the fire; a large coal fire; everything spick & span; documents on the writing table; as if she had good housemaids. She is old, but gnarled. Her face is perhaps slightly rouged, but crinkled. Her hair is curled & grizzled. Her eyes L. said, a faun’s eyes: very intense: suddenly intensifying, like an actresses. All her movements angular, intense, grown rather rigid. She examined us, very tensely, but compactly, about her book. And Lord knows if we told the truth, or if it was any good what we said, for she is past her prime; but has had an interesting highly charged past evidently; she held much in reserve. I suspect she has had a great many emotional & physical experiences, which have crystallised into packed & solid views; on life, on religion, or rather the dislike of religion; on work, on sex. She was launching into a panegyric, very tense too & stylised, upon O.W: when in she came—a very fresh coloured healthy minded doctor, in black, with loops of silver chain, good teeth, & a candid kind smile which I liked. Opposite my plate she had put a little china statue of W.W⁠[ilberforce].: opposite L.’s another of Hannah More. This led us—she & me—to discuss our, I think mythical, relationship: from that we slipped to education—she had none: to families—she had 9 in family; & they coerced her, though unwanted, through pressure of antiquated family feeling & propriety, to stay at home. Only through a great struggle did she break off & become a doctor. People in Brighton, where she has practised for 13 years, play Bridge sometimes 6 or 7 hours a day; dont have children; their husbands go to London to work in offices. They sometimes take a drive—& so on. I had the flushed & exuberant feeling which means I liked being there & talking & we broached many scraps of memories. How father asked E.R. to come when he gave his Forgotten Benefactors talk. “But I couldn’t say what it made me feel…. It was tremendous. Very courageous of him. I couldn’t think how he had the courage. No I could never say what I felt about that speech”. So she clips & cuts off. And about 7 we went out into the dark crescent, & I thought, Now what are they saying about us? & hoped I had made a good impression. O. said I must have great knowledge of other peoples lives to write A R. of O. That pleased me, having read that morning something about my ‘lyrical emptiness’. Oh but I’m going to think of Cleopatra’s Needle when I get on to my old nightmare: & so canter past it. I think I can too. And L. is giving Sally a run after her bath: I must go & work in this extraordinary hot spring morning. Work, work, work—thats my final prescription—so have written to [Bruce] Richmond."
1937.01.17,"Home again. Poor L. grumbling, making Mabel a peg on which to hang his misery oh dear. But rather a good evening all the same. Not a nice morning though: proofs; dust. How quiet London is however. Not a sound. I must make up my mind to work, & break through the enchanted circle of [illegible]. First I must tidy up: throw away all Raymond: Mary Baker: Virginia Brett: Tom Eliot: the old Years litter get things clean & fresh. Lunch with Clive tomorrow to meet I dont know who. That great mystery rather amuses me. I think Jack Hills & Violet Dickinson. A great many MSS to read. I shall also go to the Nat Gall. & to the Zoo."
1937.01.21,"News that Miss West is dying of pneumonia. A melancholy walk with L. in the rain. The usual thoughts: & this too; that I was too aloof, & never friendly eno’, & never asked her to dine. I must conquer this aloofness if I possibly can. So little one can do; but at least do it if possible. Such a mute relationship. I pass her room, & think I might have gone in; & now never shall."
1937.01.22,"Miss West died yesterday. And Miss Howlett reproaches Miss Bevan, ill at Worthing. And Miss Hepworth is now seeing L. about a job. It pours. Last night I turned Nessa to steel by talking about J.’s essay on Roger—a most curious transformation: as if some tigress lay in a cave, growling. Vita to lunch today. Polishing Gibbon. Will now I think do the A. Artists [?] leaflet—& then? Oh some stuff for the NS?"
1937.01.23,"A dripping foggy day: Miss West’s funeral at Golders Green. The same table, the same flowers: a little purple coffin: a large eagle like parson: & a scatter of brown, dowdy, very old & feeble spinsters: Miss Howlett chief mourner. Miss Howlett with knotted hands: an old pink [?] face; blue steady aged eyes. Nothing dingier & less forcible cd. be imagined. And we were forced to wail through hymn 478 or some such number; about saints receiving their due; alleluia. Only the hired man from the undertaker, or one of the crematorium servants sang: once a woman piped up: but gave out. L. & I sat grimly. The attendant then touched a spring, & the little coffin slid through; after which we gathered in the cloister & inspected the wreaths. Miss Howlett then was led forward, & formally shook hands, & thanked us for our letters. As for Miss West, had she been a kitten or a puppy I think one wd. have felt as much. And yet there was something alive, humorous, kindly, & even merry in the basement room where she sat surrounded with neat papers; a spotted horse; a carved wooden flower, & a piece of green linoleum. Miss L. came up and said she was left executor of what little money belonged to Margaret. One of the wreaths was what L. called a best seller’s wreath. Miss Delafield was there. But I think on the whole Miss W. enjoyed the H.P. She liked literary parties, & had an unselfish, quite disinterested temper. But its the service—the unreality."
1937.01.28,"Sunk once more in the happy tumultuous dream: that is to say began & ended it 12 Oct. 1937 (provisionally that is) 3 Guineas this morning, & cant stop thinking it. My plan is to write out now? without more palaver, & think perhaps it might be roughed in by Easter; but I shall allow myself, make myself, scribble a little article or two between whiles. Then I hope to float over the horrid March 15th [publication date of The Years]: wire today to say Years havent reached America. I must plate myself against that sinking in mud. And so far as I can tell, this method is almost too effective.

L. seeing Miss Lange upstairs; dining with Hutchinsons to meet Wells; & now must rush up to lunch."
1937.01.29,"Wells rather shrunk. Hair still brown, but has the dyed appearance of hair that is brown on an old face. Lines more marked: skin less plumped out. He was very affable: put both hands on top of L.’s to signalise his regret I suppose for their quarrel. Budberg is a sympathetic broad faced slow moving soft eyed slav; dignified & sincere I think. Not a nonentity. Even able to impress her slow broken English upon H.G.’s little sparrow chirp. He sat by me, & was [a] little apprehensive of the highbrow at first I think. We made talk about Scotland; then he laughed at Compton Mackenzie, always dressing up: then switched off on to the poverty of authors, & instanced Arnold [Bennett]. He totted up A.’s expense & receipts. Then we got on to Russian politics, so, somehow to Tom Eliot. Tee Ess he called him with a hiss of despite; & then proceeded to say how he, which I think meant we, had been the death of English literature. Afraid of being vulgar, thats what was at the root of it. And Tom’s religion. By that we came to the Archbishop. I wonder—if I had any brains in my foolish little head, I wish they would reveal this to me: does Cosmo Gordon Lang ever alone at dead of night face his Trinity? We all have to—But does he … & so on. He likes to be listened to; & to chatter on, loosely generally, as he said to me when the gentlemen came upstairs. We’ve had a loose general kind of talk. Then he lay back in the arm chair, put his tiny hands & still tinier feet together, & chirped away. Sometimes Budberg interrupted with her solemn intoning: attacked Germany; defended France. It was old man’s talk; mellower than I remembered; mischievous; eyes a little bleared; kindly in his way; merry. Had been warned off the air for some joke; off the Daily Mail for another joke. He gives the impression that on the whole he is a detached satisfied little man; conscious of his lack of distinction; prone to snap at any pretence; introduced “my father the professional cricketer”; content I think with his position, & immensely interested still. He wished to live to be 170. is 70. Had one seen him behind a counter he wd. have seemed the very type of busy little grocer. I couldnt ever detect any mass behind his pointed beak. And I suspect that when he faces his Trinity at dead of night there are a good many books that he thinks justly, trash: & he shuffles his hands among the loose innumerable pages; & then snaps at Culture; but remembers that he has done a vast mass of work, & thinks it wont all die; & is amused at the place he has made—from Bromley Kent to Regents Park: the Baroness; & I suppose the greatest circulation in the whole world. A humane man in some corner; also brutal; also entirely without poetry.

This I scribble with the snow darkening my skylight; we are not going to Rodmell: I need not present prizes to the young Animal Fanciers; & we are waiting to see if Mr Rich of Rich & Cowan will tell us about Miss Lange.

Slight uneasinesses pass like vapour already over me: prelude to The Years. Miss Bevan has read the proofs but says nothing; Miss West presumably had read & did say nothing. And I must expect that attitude on my friends part. And I must dig myself deep in 3 Guineas … so that the other voices are scarcely heard. It will be immensely depressing; but I’ve no doubt I can survive."
1937.02.12,"Why should I write here? Only that I am devilishly anxious. L. is going to a Harley St specialist at 4 today to get a report: whether the sugar means diabetes or prostate gland or nothing serious. And I must face facts: how to keep cool, how to control myself, if it is a bad report. Work is my only help. That is the conclusion I came to last night. Probably it is only a question of treatment. Anyhow we shall soon know, unless he keeps us hanging about.

It is a very fine cold day & we are going straight on down to Rodmell where there is a L. party meeting & Q. to dinner. I have been writing hard since Jan 28th at 3 Guineas, & must simply keep at it. Even if I dont manage to finish it,—& I expect I shall—it is the one support. I have got it into trim—that is I can I think pour all I want to rather roughly & quickly into this form. Various people skim in and out: but that becomes very dim. We had too the anxiety about Julian—he tells C. Mauron that he means to enlist for Spain. Cornford’s son was killed there last week. But I cant feel that now anything like so much as I did before this happened. Nessa was in one of her entirely submerged moods on Monday when we went in. Always that extraordinary depth of despair. But I must fight, thats my instinct. And happily these statements may be extreme; but we are faced with a horrid afternoon; & cant ignore it. Odd tho how any kind of action—that we have to get ready & go—makes thinking impossible. I feel like the man who had to keep dancing on hot bricks. Cant let myself stop. Hence I suppose I write here; wh. explains why Tolstoy & his wife kept diaries."
1937.02.15,"Oh it was heavenly driving down to Rodmell on Friday evening with that weight off us! I walked Harley Street up & down up & down for an hour; people looked at me; I bought a paper; dropped my handkerchief; always returned to the swing doors of 149. People kept on going in & out. & I hardly could make myself turn my back. At last just before 5 L. came in his new light overcoat, & smiled. Well he was quite composed. And the whole thing at once fell into different proportions. Graham thinks its only a case of diet: eats too great a whack of sugar; wdn’t even examine him for diabetes; said nothing about prostate gland; found all organs very healthy; told him to continue eating as before until Hensman communicated. And L.’s symptoms are almost over. So as I say we drove down, in that odd relieved state which seems as much physical as mental; as if one’s body could unfurl; & become warm & sleepy. Got to MH. only at 7.30. had to dine hurriedly; Q. rang up to say his car had broken down. The meeting. N. Lyons sprightly & talkative; Q. came at 9.30; in gum boots wet through; had dinner at 10.30: went back over the downs in the rain. And over us brooded the same delicious ease & content, as if another space of life had been granted us.

On Sunday the O. had 2 little mildly appreciative notes about The Years; & I observed, with pleasure, that all praise & blame & talk about that book seems like tickling a rhinoceros with a feather. This is true; & remarkable. I connect it partly with my 1932 philosophic revelation: one doesnt matter: also with my present absorption in Three Guineas."

7:600 I have now written for 3 weeks at 3 Guineas, & have done 38 pages. Now I’ve used up that vein momently & want a few days change. At what? Cant at the moment think. And a kind gentleman from the Motor Union has troubled my peace with a copy of the Saturday Review (USA) in which I am called a maker of films & laces; a sitter in shaded drawing rooms, & so on. Now I will use a few minutes to lay this demon. I am quite sure that the next lap of my life will be accompanied with whistlings & catcalls in this strain. If I live another 15 years & go on writing they will probably change their tune. The question I have now to settle is what ‘attitude’ to adopt. This kind of sneer has an inhibiting effect for the moment. Of course reason tells me that it is the Proletarian growl trying to rationalise itself. But I must be quit of the need even of defending myself. I want to forge ahead, on my own lines. To do this I must always have a book or article on foot: except when we can escape, as I hope in June, to other settings. But in London where I am exposed all day & every day to criticism some plating of resolution is absolutely needed. And I think I’ve got it by the tip of the tail—a new kind of indifference. I experiment with snubs & sneers. How little they matter in the sum! how little they count with other people—how little the goodness or badness of my books affects the world. And there is the world—represented by picture galleries, the Caledonian Market, Gibbon, Nessa, going to MH., walking, planning new arrangements of the room, & always throwing my mind 2 or 3 miles ahead.

Stephen Spender came to tea & dinner the other day [16 February]. Rather a beautiful if too conventionally poetic young man: sunk cheeks, large blue eyes, skin always burning; great enthusiasm, but now tempered, & rather metalled because, having married, his friend, the male, joined the F Legion, is fighting in Spain; Inez, who is political in the Oxford way only, sits at Brussels studying Spanish MSS. Stephen finds this intolerable. Why then did you marry, we asked, more or less. To stabilise himself; because he dreaded the old Brindled Tom puss life of William [Plomer], safe by the fireside. Now is torn two ways: so Inez sits there, in order, should he be killed in Spain—but he’s only broadcasting—she may have her job to fall back on. A curious interpretation of marriage, dictated by the guns. I like him: told him not to fight. He said it was the easiest thing to do. I said give up speaking—he said But it brought in money. He argued that we cannot let the Fascists overrun Spain: then it’ll be France; then us. We must fight. L. said he thought things had now gone so far it did not matter. Fighting did no good. S. said the C.P. which he had that day joined, wanted him to be killed, in order that there might be another Byron. He has a child’s vanity about himself. Interesting to me at the moment, as I’m working out the psychology of vanity. Then he went to speak about Spain at the Friends House, & we to Uncle Vanya. A very cold night. I have left out my lunch with Christabel, & various other entertainments. Oh yes, I’m rather nervous about March 15 but can hold myself very much aloof. We were dining with the MacCarthys, but ‘the eldest Miss Cornish died suddenly last night at St George’s Hospital—so she must put you off’."
1937.02.19,"The difficulty wh. now faces me is how to find a public, a way of publishing, all the new ideas that are in me? I’ve written this morning 3 descriptions for Nessa’s pictures: they can be printed by us no doubt, & somehow put into circulation. But then theres in my drawer several I think rather good sketches; & a chapter on biography. Clearly I have here in the egg a new method of writing criticism. I rather think so. I feel that I want some private way of producing these studies; these adumbrations. If one writes them for a paper the attitude changes. Theyre not Times articles or N.S. articles: yet I dont want to keep them till theyre books, or flutter them out separately … Lord knows. Anyhow I like the fruitful sense it gives me.

Yesterday Ethel Sands in black & silver fur to tea; early; had been to Eltham House: on top of her Eth Williamson, striding, masculine, shooting her linen as it used to be called. Ethel flitting by the rich dusk of high liberal life; full of swerving half sentences; betwixt & between. Talked of her own funeral: this was my private joke with her—Then L. came & we talked about India. E. had been impressed by the Eng. Civilian: most of all by the rains: how the temp. fell, like this, she drew her finger along the table cloth. Then I forget—I flirted with old Ethel: about her golden wedding present. Nan [Hudson] used to know about water gilding. The Sinclairs see no danger ahead for England. One of her nephews tho’ says this is his last winter’s hunting. Eth has a telescope wh. she will sell us cheap. Off she went. Ethel stayed on. We discussed the young; catastrophe; she went, with the usual sweetness, to sit with Nan who has laryngitis. Molly’s sister scalded her foot & died of heart failure."
1937.02.20,"I turn my eyes away from the Press as I go upstairs, because there are all the Review Copies of The Years packed & packing. They go out next week: this is my last week end of comparative peace. What do I anticipate with such clammy coldness? I think chiefly that my friends wont mention it, will turn the conversation rather awkwardly. I think I anticipate considerable lukewarmness among the friendly reviewers—respectful tepidity; & a whoop of red Indian delight from the Grigs I suppose what I expect is that they’ll say now Mrs W. has written a long book all about nothing who will joyfully & loudly announce that this is the long drawn twaddle of a prim prudish bourgeois mind, & say that now no one can take Mrs W. seriously again. But violence I shant so much mind. What I think I shall mind most is awkwardness when I go, say to Tilton or Charleston, & they dont know what to say. And since we shant get away till June I must expect a very full exposure to this damp firework atmosphere. They will say its a tired book; a last effort … Well, now that I’ve written that down I feel that even so I can exist in that shadow. That is if I keep hard at work. And there’s no lack of that. I discussed a book of illustrated incidents with Nessa yesterday; we are going to produce 12 lithographs for Xmas, printed by ourselves. As we were talking, Margery Fry rang up to ask me to see Julian Fry about Roger. So that begins to press on me. Then L. wants if possible to have 3 Gs. for the autumn: & I have my Gibbon, my broadcast, & a possible leader on Biography to fill in chinks. I plan to keep out of literary circles till the mild boom is over. And this, waiting, under consideration is after all the worst. This time next month I shall feel more at ease. And its only now & then I mind now"
1937.02.21,"Isherwood & Sally [Chilver] last night. I⁠[sherwoo]⁠d rather a find: very small red cheeked nimble & vivacious. We chattered. He lives in a pension at Brussels; is heir to an E⁠[lizabe]⁠than house near Manchester; & likes my books. The last put some colour into my cheeks. He said Morgan & I were the only living novelists the young—he, Auden, Spender I suppose—take seriously. Indeed he admires us both I gathered warmly. For M.’s books he has a passion. “I’ll come out with it then Mrs Woolf—you see, I feel youre a poetess: he does the thing I want to do … a perfect contraption.” But I was satisfied with my share of the compliment wh. came very pat in these days of depression. Auden & he are writing away together. He does the prose, A. the poetry. A. wants innumerable blankets on his bed; innumerable cups of tea; then shuts the shutters & draws the blinds & writes. Id. is a most appreciative merry little bird. A real novelist, I suspect; not a poet; full of acute observations on character & scenes. Odd how few ‘novelists’ I know: it wd. interest me to discuss fiction with him. Sally rather smudged & pale: but then Id. & I were such chatterboxes. Suddenly he said he must meet John Andrews at Rules & motor to Croydon, has to fly to Paris for one day today. Such is the life of the young when theyre not preparing revolutions. One of the most vital & observant of the young: & a relief after the mute dismals of the others. In fact both he & Sally now think things are going well in England, & that Madrid wont fall. So we chop & change. I’ve now ‘done’ 8 incidents. Julian Fry alas for tea."
1937.02.22,"Julian Fry last night. Stories about his ranch. The condition of the beef trade. Unfinished work: thin cows sent to England. Stories of dances: driving home; “lit up”: we gave him the honk honk honk & the ra ra ra; my wifes passionate: they say a man marries a woman like his mother: no dont send me that letter. I like to know of it (Roger’s praises) but if it were there in an envelope I cdn’t read it. Stayed from 5:15 to 12. & oh I was sleepy after talking to G. Sturgeon in R⁠[ichmon]⁠d Park. No time. The translator coming"
1937.02.23,"That extraordinary scribble means, I suppose, the translator coming. Madame or Mlle Youniac(?) Not her name. And I had so much to write about Julian, who is half a sensitive suppressed intellectual, living with rather acute affections & perceptions in Roger’s shade. (I was devoted to him: but he wanted me to hate my public school. And I never got enough of the open air, till Joan took us to Failand. Even then I was afraid of lambs. And then I drank too much after bump suppers at Cambridge .. Oh Roger always had so many things on hand. One felt one didnt come up to his standard. Then there was Champco: & the Ott. I didnt develop that side of me till later. But I had a few days quite alone with him—let me see (he’s very precise) that was July 1934. We drove from Dieppe to Dijon. I had the impression that he was much happier. At Norwich one day the car punctured; & we didnt meet & so on, & I said to Eva, a few years ago he’d have been raging & ramping—now he was as calm as anything.) What I meant was, this the shady civilised side is only half of Julian: the other is the ordinary Colonial, which I like too; all this expert talk about cattle; & the coyotes, & how they ride. A good rider is a man who can jump into the saddle of an unbroken horse, & sit him while he breaks in two. How Julian did this, & cdn’t catch onto the saddle & fell: & Eva wdn’t let him mount; but he has a great affection for that horse. A boy of 16 is now in charge. The reason they wear high heeled boots is so that they dont catch in the stirrups. Only through wearing those boots was he now here. All the beef is sold to the liners going to China. Beef is always good on ship—not mutton. And he likes riding all day after his cattle; & thinks, at night, if he has rounded them up that he has done something. Doubts sometimes crop up I suspect; about his wife too. But one doesnt know how one makes these decisions. Roger always gave him very good advice, rather casually I gather. And he drank a bottle of claret, 2 glasses of vermouth, & got a little “lit” as he would call it. And he wd. have stayed talking about Canada till one. I suppose the stimulus of society. So I’ve no time or room to describe the translator, save that she wore some nice gold leaves on her black dress; is a woman I suppose with a past; amorous; intellectual; lives half the year in Athens; is in with Jaloux &c, red lipped, strenuous; a working Fchwoman; friend of the Margeries; matter of fact; intellectual; we went through The Waves. What does “See here he comes?” mean & so on.

And the Dr. says L. is quite normal! So all that might have been spared"
1937.02.24,"Dearest Virginia, I am back when you get this, alive Westminster: will you send word to 19 North Street when & where I can come & see you? 6 o’clock or dine alone Sibyl … Paris. 12. 23.II.1937. This significant & illegible card has just been brought me by L. & I copy it as material for a memoir: raw matter to serve in writing the history of my own times: also to fill 5 minutes before luncheon. I’m off again, after 5 days lapse (writing Faces & Voices) on 3 Guineas; after a most dismal hacking got a little canter, & hope now to spin ahead. Odd that one sometimes does a transition quite quickly. A quiet day for a wonder—no one seen yesterday: so I went to Caledonian market, cdn’t find spoon shop; bought yellow gloves 3/- & stockings, 1/- & so home. Started reading French again: Misanthrope & Colette’s memoirs given me last summer by Janie: when I was in the dismal drowse & cdn’t fix on that or anything.

Today the reviewers (oh d—n this silly thought) have their teeth fixed in me; but what care I for a goosefeather bed &c. In fact, once I get into the canter over Three Gs. I think I shall see only the flash of the white rails & pound along to the goal."
1937.02.28,"I’m so entirely imbued in 3 Guineas that I can hardly jerk myself away to write here, (here in fact I again dropped my pen to think about my next paragraph—universities—how will that lead to professions & so on.) Its a bad habit. Yesterday it was effectively broken by Desmond who came punctually at one, & stayed till 7.15. nor did we stop talking all that time. Nor was I once bored or wished it to stop. A greater tribute to D. cdn’t be paid. What did we talk about? The Amberley Papers: the Russells: her self conscious control: how she lies on the floor in an attitude calculated to attract, but pretends to ignore it. Now I like nothing better than conscious allurement, D. said. I said was he no longer attracted. And he cried out No, its all gone—all gone. As a man in a train said, I’m not impotent, but I’ve had enough. This may have been to shut off all thoughts of the nameless American lady. Anyhow, he was well lit—dear old Desmond—as round as a marble: a paunch pendant; but nearly bald: with an odd 18th Century look, as if he had been dining at the Club with Johnson—a kind of Goldsmith or Boswell; a congenial spirit. And as full of human kindness as a ripe grape with juice. I think he had set himself now not to write a great book but to be nice to other people. What can I do for you, was his last remark on the stairs. Alas, he carried off The Years, wh. means—well, never mind. We talked—so easily & merrily. I went back to old talks with Lytton—talking shop about Kipling’s style: he had the same quotation—about the man who cut his throat & looked like a robin redbreast—that I had. Then how Jack Squire has imposed another false self upon his true self, which is sensitive, unhappy. He dresses up as Dr Johnson, but a Johnson without the power of speech. Lives now with Miss Warrender & drinks: she teaches him not to drink & he teaches her to drink. So to the death of Margaret Cornish after scalding her foot in St George’s Hospital. He was rung up as he was working at 2: went to the hospital; saw she was dying, so red & panting. Told her not to be afraid. Molly too deaf to hear so went home. D. & Cecilia [her sister] sat there. Her breathing was like a saw going up & down. And they prolonged it with oxygen; so that she lay tortured till 6 when they heard the stump of the nurses bringing early tea, & the voices of children like birds, & then she died. Dear old Desmond, infinitely human & sensible—a good send-off from him to the other world. So to Rachel & Michael. & so—but now its one, on a snowy Sunday. We were prevented from going to MH. Miss Bevan strained the car. Its axle has to be mended. But a wet dreary week end anyhow."
1937.03.01,"I wish I could write out my sensations at this moment. They are so peculiar & so unpleasant. Partly T⁠[ime] of L⁠[ife]? I wonder. A physical feeling as if I were drumming slightly in the veins: very cold: impotent: & terrified. As if I were exposed on a high ledge in full light. Very lonely. L. out to lunch. Nessa has Quentin & dont want me. Very useless. No atmosphere round me. No words. Very apprehensive. As if something cold & horrible—a roar of laughter at my expense were about to happen. And I am powerless to ward it off: I have no protection. And this anxiety & nothingness surround me with a vacuum. It affects the thighs chiefly. And I want to burst into tears, but have nothing to cry for. Then a great restlessness seizes me. I think I could walk it off—walk & walk till I am asleep. But I begin to dislike that sudden drugged sleep. And I cannot unfurl my mind & apply it calmly & unconsciously to a book. And my own little scraps look dried up & derelict. And I know that I must go on doing this dance on hot bricks till I die. This is a little superficial I admit. For I can burrow under & look at myself displayed in this ridiculous way & feel complete submarine calm: a kind of calm moreover which is strong eno’ to lift the entire load: I can get that at moments; but the exposed moments are terrifying. I looked at my eyes in the glass once & saw them positively terrified. Its the 15th March approach⁠[ing] I suppose—the dazzle of that head lamp on my poor little rabbits body wh. keeps it dazed in the middle of the road. (I like that phrase. That gives me confidence.)"
1937.03.02,"I’m going to be beaten, I’m going to be laughed at, I’m going to be held up to scorn & ridicule—I found myself saying those words just now. Yet I’ve been absorbed all the morning in the Un⁠[iversit]⁠y part of 3 Gs. And the absorption is genuine; & my great defence against the cold madness that overcame me last night. Why did it suddenly point itself like a rain cloud & discharge all its cold water? Because I was switched off doing Pictures in the morning; & then at the play, I suddenly thought the Book Society has not even recommended The Years. Thats true; but the B.S. is not an infallible guide. Anyhow these days of waiting must be a dull cold torture. I shall be happy eno’ this time next month I’ve no doubt. Meanwhile, suffer me now & again to write out my horror, the sudden cold madness, here. It is partly T. of L. I think still. And it wont be anything like so bad in action as in prospect. The worst will be that the book will be treated with tepid politeness, as an effusive diluted tired book. All my other books have stirred up strife; this one will sink slowly & heavily. But when thats said, need I fear more? I may get praise from some people—indeed I think there must be some ‘seriousness’ in it. And I can feel a little proud that I have faced the music; that we have sold 5,000 before publication; that we shall get some money; that I’m doing my share, & not merely subsiding into terrified silence. Also my own psychology interests me. I intend to keep full notes of my ups & downs, for my private information. And thus objectified, the pain & shame become at once much less. And I have proved to my own conviction that I can write with fury, with rapture, with absorption still. Now the BBC want a story."
1937.03.07,"As will be seen on the last page my spiritual temperature went up with a rush; why I dont know, save that I’ve been having a good gallop at 3 Guineas. Now I have broached the fatal week & must expect a sudden drop. Its going to be pretty bad, I’m certain; but at the same time I am convinced that the drop needn’t be fatal; that is, the book may be damned, We have sold 5,300 before publication with faint praise; but the point is that I myself know why its a failure, & that its failure is deliberate. I also know that I have reached my point of view, as writer, as being. As writer I am fitted out for another 2 books—3 Gs & Roger; (let alone articles); as being the interest & safety of my present life are unthrowable. This I have, honestly, proved this winter. Its not a gesture. And honestly the diminution of fame, that people aren’t any longer enthusiastic, gives me the chance to observe quietly. Also I am in a position to hold myself aloof. I need never seek out anyone. In short either way I’m safe, & look forward, after the unavoidable tosses & tumbles of the next ten days, to a slow, dark, fruitful spring, summer & autumn.

This is set down I hope once & for all. And please to remember it on Friday when the reviews come in.

To Cockfosters yesterday, & saw the old tramp woman on the bank, lighting a damp fire & eating dry bread. I took What shall we do then in my pocket. A curious comment. Saw also the monument to the birth of George Earl Grey in 1702. Had buttered toast & jam & saw the girl going to the vicarage to rehearse a religious drama. Many people. Ethel Sands, Shaw Desmond. Eth Bowen. Miss Loeb at Clive’s."
1937.03.08,"What I noticed on the walk to Cockfosters were: the father mother & small boy: (to whom the school took off their caps, one said I gave her the glad eye) the father saying “I’ve a large book waiting for you” The son piping up “I’ve got some stamps already”—the father, “I’ve torn off lots of stamps” upon wh. I thought of L. if he had a son. Then the wall round the park; how we had to walk as the car is still broken, how at every gate or even fence there was a notice This is Private .. Private road: I thought how I cursed the possessors of great parks who made me walk along the road, shaved every second by a car or a lorry; then the tramps. It was a wet cold day: had been raining in the night; the grass border very damp. The middle aged woman was trying to make a fire: a man in townish clothes was lying on his side in the grass. Both had stupid coarse broad rather truculent faces, as if they wd fire off oaths if one spoke or even looked too long. When we came back after an hour the woman had got the fire to burn, & the man was sitting up, among some old clothes & bits of dirty paper; also I think a small perambulator of some sort. She was cutting a slice of bread off a loaf, but there was no butter. At night it became very cold, & as we sat down to our duck L. said he wondered how they [s]⁠pent the night. I said probably they go to the workhouse. This fitted in with What shall we do then, wh. I read in the train. But incidentally I’m not so much impressed as I expected by it. Vivid, but rather wordy so far."
1937.03.10,"The fatal day is approaching—in fact I think if I can slip out after tea & buy a paper I may have the experience tomorrow—when my little reputation lies like an old cigarette end. But I’m too jaded with 3 Gs. to care to find even the right metaphor. In my perhaps cowardly wish to store have next week as an empty compartment, I’ve crammed this too full: had Christabel yesterday, must have Nan Hudson today: & to my dismay L. suddenly wants to have Mrs R. & Elaine tomorrow: & the Bagenals are dining. On Friday we get off—the doomed discarded ridiculed novelist. What care I? I begin to whistle, but I’m too jaded."
1937.03.12,"Oh the relief! L. brought the Lit Sup to me in bed & said Its quite good. And so it is; & T. & Tide says I’m a firstrate novelist & a great lyrical poet. And I can already hardly read through the reviews: but feel a little dazed, to think then its not nonsense; it does make an effect. Yet of course not in the least the effect I meant. But now, my dear, after all that agony, I’m free, whole; round. Can go full ahead. And so stop this cry of content; sober joy. Off to MH. Julian back today.

I use my last 5 minutes before lunch to note that though I have slipped the gall & fret & despair even of the past few weeks wholly today, & shan’t I think renew them; I have once more loaded myself with the strain of 3 Gs. at which I have been writing hard & laboriously. So now I’m straining to draw that cart across the rough ground. It seems therefore that there is no rest; no sense of Its finished. One always harnesses oneself by instinct; & cant live without the strain. Now The Years will completely die out from my mind.

Car mended. But rain pouring."
1937.03.14,"I am in such a twitter owing to 2 columns in the Observer praising The Years that I cant, as I foretold, go on with 3 Guineas. Why I even sat back just now & thought with pleasure of people reading that review. And when I think of the agony I went through in this room, just over a year ago…. when it dawned on me that the whole of 3 years work was a complete failure: & then when I think of the mornings here when I used to stumble out & cut up those proofs & write 3 lines, & then go back & lie on my bed—the worst summer in my life, but at the same time the most illuminating—its no wonder my hand trembles. What most pleases me tho’, is the obvious chance now since de Selincourt sees it, that my intention in The Years may be not so entirely muted & obscured as I feared. The TLS spoke as if it were merely the death song of the middle classes: a series of exquisite impressions; but he sees that it is a creative, a constructive book. Not that I’ve yet altogether read him: but he has pounced on some of the key sentences. And this means that it will be debated; & this means that 3 Gs. will strike very sharp & clear on a hot iron: so that my immensely careful planning won’t be baulked by time of life &c. as I had made certain. Making certain however was an enormous discovery for me, though. If there’s one triumph I applaud—excuse this flamboyant language—it is the afternoon when Desmond came, & Nan Hudson was there: & I almost cracked with the wish to talk to him about The Yrs & Nan sat on, like some tepid bread poultice; & I summoned my forces, & got her to talk to me about her own life & Ethel (that was a chink) instead of letting the agonising hour go to ruin.

Now at any rate money is assured: L. shall have his new car; we will be floated again; & my last lap—if I’ve only 10 years of life more—should be fruitful. Work—work. But at the moment, the relief is so great, not I think an ignoble fame-gratified relief—that I feel myself rocking up & down, like a bush a huge fowl sat on. Still I must remember that I’m bound to get a good many shrewd knocks. And much of The Years is very feeble—for example the scene in the college still makes me blush.

Dinner at Charleston last night. Julian grown a man—I mean vigorous, controlled, as I guess embittered, something to me tragic in the sadness now, his mouth & face much tenser; as if he had been thinking in solitude. Nessa said he hasn’t altogether given up his idea of Spain: all depends on getting a job here. I felt him changed: taut, tense, on the defensive: yet affectionate: but no longer spontaneous. He comes to tea today. And L. was irritated by the intense “self centredness” of my family: Nessa only cares for her children: Julian can’t even let her know his decision, so inconsiderate; all “on the make”. This is partly due to his family complex; but there’s some truth in it.

And now I can put my philosophy of the free soul into operation. Thats what I’m thinking—needn’t go to the writers auction on 20th. All the falsities can drop off."
1937.03.15,"Spending a lazy morning. Tired in the head. Too much talk—Julian & Bunny—why do we live in such a way that the sight of our oldest friends & nephews back from China gives us a little shock of regret—I mean misery for the quiet evening gone? Julian set & rather self centred. Can only think what he ought to do. Still if what he ought to do is something for the world at large, one must excuse this grinding of an iron upon a Granite slab. Anyhow, being too tired to write, I’ve been thinking cd. I recast the rejected section of The Years for the Uniform Edition? Why do I bother? Only I rather suspect its needed for the whole argument impression. But there it is, safe; & I needn’t consider this seriously 5,300 I think sold before publication at the moment. Keep it at the back of my mind, & judge from reviews—save that they’re all so scatter brained—how far the book misses fire on that account. We are staying till 3.30: L. has rung up the Press & about 25 more Years have been ordered. A good sale possible I think. Say 10, or 11, or 12,000.

Brooding over Gibbon. Perhaps a weeks break to finish that wd be good. I dont think I shall much mind the chitter chatter; shall be glad when this following week is over; all reviews out & forgotten; & then Lord the pleasure of coming here for 10 quiet days at Easter. And they shall be quiet too—that I swear. We have done our duty by family & society quite sufficiently."
1937.03.17,"The communist press began its little snigger yesterday. John Brophy in D.T. a tired anaemic middle class book. So be it. That sneer is already rubbed out. But I’m too jaded to tackle the Professional chapter of 3 Gs. so write here. Yesterday we had Buxton to lunch, who had never heard of me or my agonies; & then I fetched my new lustre, & walked in the rain all across Hyde Park, now pink with coronation seats. This morning Austen Chamberlain is dead, & its an off day for me. No reviews I hope. L.’s irritation bad; will go to Hensman. No I cant write; & think shall I look at my Gibbon? Very wisely I have kept the week empty: save for the persistent Hayward tomorrow. But we know that the Spectator is giving a whole page to The Years: that the E. Standard is giving 2 columns: Desmond promises 2 cols on Sunday: & theres the NS. on Friday—so my peace is only that of a grasshopper under a leaf. No, I dont seriously fidget any more; because its plain there are 2 lines of criticism: one the Communist; the other the free mind. Had there been only the one, I shd. have been damned. As it is I’m discussed (as usual) & no one has yet seen the point—my point."
1937.03.19,"Now this is one of the strangest of my experiences—‘they’ say almost universally that The Years is a masterpiece. The Times says so. Bunny. Something about a master-piece, & how Mrs W. since To the L has more to give us than any living novelist … astonishing fertility. &: Howard Spring: If somebody had told me I shd. write this, even a week ago, let alone 6 months ago, I shd. have given a jump like a shot hare. How entirely & absolutely incredible it would have been! The praise chorus began yesterday: by the way I was walking in Covent Garden & found St Pauls, CG for the first time, heard the old char singing as she cleaned the chairs in the ante hall; then went to Burnets [of Garrick St.]: chose stuff; bought the E. Standard & found myself glorified as I read it in the Tube. A calm quiet feeling, glory: & I’m so steeled now I dont think the flutter will much worry me. Now I must begin again on 3 Gs.

Hensman is now come, I suppose—not that I’m much upset by that: as I dont seriously think this irritation matters. At the same moment, Miss Strachan has broken out into spots. L. suggests fleas. I heard him describing fleas just now in the Press. I have toiled a little at 3 Gs. but cant concentrate sufficiently: fly up into easy flights, because I’m praised no doubt.

Yesterday at Hayward’s we heard a strange story. He lives in Bina Gardens, called Bina from Rubina, the builders favourite daughter. He sits askew in a 3 cornered chair. Cant get up. His room is an uncreative room: spick & span: too tidy. Carrington painted him a book case: the books all ranged in sizes. 2 glass horses on the Victorian mahogany table: flowers separately springing: a dish of carefully arranged fruit. The story was about his landlord: in prison for writing indecent letters to the girls at Roedean—addressed To the Head Girl—therefore opened by the headmistress. These he concocted in the kitchen while Mrs Baker? cooked John’s dinner. He interviewed all the lodgers & stated the facts. He liked telling this: partly to impress me, I think; & give a kick at Dryden & editing. Wont see more of the spring he said than Walls Ice Cream van. Has a great thick soft red lip: frozen green eyes; & angular attitudes like a monkey on a string. Said how Tom gave it as his opinion that Anglo Catholics may not, owing to Church Law, use contraceptives. Hence the indecent letters, I suppose. Another feather in the cap of Tom’s Church. Now I must creep upstairs to see if Hensmans gone. My treat is to go to the Caledonian market."
1937.03.22,"No I didnt. It rained. And I left my umbrella apparently in a bus. And my brain is tired—yes, it was a strain, holding myself erect through the suspense of last week. Now I’ve a holiday from reviews till Wednesday (Listener) then till Sunday, & Desmond does it. And all 3 Gs. is held up—yet I have it pressing for speech. Can I describe old Kot. yesterday. L. looked at the telephone, thinking he was mad. Had been ‘ill’. Mere solitude mania I think. Calmed down. Gave us tea on hard chairs in basement, abused Ott & Murry. So shall now stop writing for a day."
1937.03.25,"Yes, 2 days lying down, & cant write today. But a divine holiday. No reviews. Listener not done it. And sales great. A rush before Easter: 280 sold yesterday. Nessa to tea. But I will not write: am only waiting for my signature to dry. B. Richmond asked one for Ormond St. hospital. Boat Race at 11.30. Then we go tomorrow. No letters about Years, save one from Ly Simon. Kot, Hayward, Margery Fry all in favour of Years. No one else has yet read, or spoken. And its very fine, clear & cold. The Dss of Bedford lost."
1937.03.27,"No, I am not going to titivate Gibbon—that is condense by a thousand words. Too much screw needed, & my brains unstrung. Merely scribbling here, over a log fire, on a cold but bright Easter morning; sudden shafts of sun, a scatter of snow on the hills early; sudden storms, ink black, octopus pouring, coming up; & the rooks fidgetting & pecking in the elm trees. As for the beauty, as I always say when I walk the terrace after breakfast, too much for one pair of eyes. Enough to float a whole population in happiness, if only they wd. look. Curiously a combination, this garden, with the Church, & the cross of the Church black against Asheham Hill. That is all the elements of the English brought together, accidentally. We came down on Thursday, packed in the rush in London; cars spinning all along the roads: yesterday at last perfect freedom from telephones, & reviews, & no one rang up. I began Lord Ormont & his Aminta, & found it so rich, so knotted, so alive, & muscular after the pale little fiction I’m used to, that, alas, it made me wish to write fiction again. Meredith underrated. I like his effort to escape plain prose. And he has humour & some insight too—more than they allow him now. Also Gibbon. And so I’m well fitted out; but cant write more than this without the old tightening & throbbing at the back of the head."
1937.03.28,"Again I take my tiny little flutter, with the accursed Xtian bells ringing—however, dulled as they are with 500 years or more at Rodmell I cant seriously dislike them. A June morning. A log fire & a June morning. No review by Desmond: so that sword hangs suspended. L. thinks he’s jealous. I dont think that—suspect some perplexity. Q. rings up. L. will go to tea. I shant. I shall lapse into dreams. What luck if I cd. strike a good vein! Reading Othello was it once at Asheham—I remember sitting in the garden there, so sublime.

Yesterday a reporter for the N. York Times rang up: was told he cd. look at the outside of 52 if he chose. At 4.30 as I was boiling the kettle a huge black Daimler drew up. Then a dapper little man in a tweed coat appeared in the garden. I reached the sitting room—saw him standing there looking round. L. ignored him. L. in the orchard with Percy [Bartholomew, gardener]. Then I guessed. He had a green note book & stood looking about jotting things down. I ducked my head—he almost caught me. At last L. turned & fronted him. No Mrs W. didnt want that kind of publicity. I raged. A bug walking over ones skin—cdn’t crush him. The bug taking note. L. politely led him back to his Daimler & his wife. But they’d had a nice run from London—bugs, to come & steal in & take notes."
1937.03.29,"The misery is passing off in its usual way—a drowsy slackness this morning. And there is nothing much to stir it. I read a great deal yesterday—White’s Selborne, & the London Spy. A very cold night. No, this is hardly worth writing out. A man in an overcoat took notes in the field yesterday, & then someone banged on the door. I sat tight. L. was at Charleston. Julian, he says, very depressed. Today Ethel S. writes that she has read The Y. but will not comment till she has re-read. I suppose dislikes it. Well—& will look in on Wednesday. No. My policy is to lie low & invite no visitors till the summer is over—a luxurious couching like a fox on its nest. Meredith is an influential writer: how wd it be to counter him with H. James? a kind of medical mixture? And my books are waiting at Lewes: Southey’s commonplace book; Leaves of Grass: Clarendon’s history in 6 vols—rather a leap in the dark—all for £1-8."
1937.03.30,"No good playing Schubert if one thinks L. minds the noise. And I dont really want it either. Cold grey day—reading rather better todays over the fire. Yesterday I walked to the Bridge [at Southease] & back over the hanger. This is a Gilbert White word. Odd thing in White is the change of proportion. 1770 proportions. Thus the downs become majestic mountains; a tortoise as large as an elephant; an oak a forest &c. A very pleasing change, like a slow motion picture: a magnifyer of things. Everything six times its present size. Thats one of the great charms to us. Then the clear bell like sentences. Had no scientific instruments: only his eyes. Question when & how science suddenly developed. 18th Cent, practically middle ages.

Ethel rings up to say she has re-read Years, under Miss Hudson’s direction, & finds it no longer unintelligible, but superb—How can this be true of any mind? Yet I’m a little relieved. For one thing it makes it unnecessary to argue. I shall accept. Also shows The Years has selling power—if Miss Hudson can spontaneously enjoy. Today our last of seclusion. Possible London post this evening. Q. to dine. L.P. meeting, I am resting my brain entirely till we go back. But Thursday will be a bit of a rub—all the way to Minstead & back with the talk thrown in: but when one’s dying one must. Janet dying I mean. How strange to lie there calmly contemplating the distant but inevitable end—& Emphie watching too. But I rather suspect she is happy in her quiet composed way—save for Emphie—reading W⁠[ordswor]⁠th & Me⁠[redi]⁠th I expect, as she used, out of her carefully annotated copies. She read them with me in the Park at Firle 30 years ago I suppose."
1937.03.31,"Thank goodness, better today. Clear & stable—at least I’m sunning myself on that ledge at the moment. But I will not write till Monday. A hot June morning. Little gummy noises under the trees as if buds were popping, twigs exploding. Rooks cawing. Trees still clear & coloured. Letters began last night. Lord Olivier. “Being out of sorts & unable to tackle serious books I read The Years”—that sort of drivle. And the visitors beginning—Hugh [Walpole], Sally Graves party. Today a shifty apologetic letter from Sparrow asks me not to read his review, of wh he’s not proud. L. says ‘little swine ..’ Ethel engrossed by Dotty. So be it. Q. last night pleased me, praising The Y. as poetry—like To the L the oddest novel he’d ever read. A good meeting. Fenders & pokers brought by Mr Macer Wright. Louie enchanted. But cant write as the above shows. Hand wont hold pen."
1937.04.02,"How I interest myself! Quite set up & perky today with a mind brimming, because I was so damnably depressed & smacked on the cheek by Edwin Muir in The Listener & by Scott James in the Life & Letters on Friday. They both gave me a smart snubbing: EM says The Years is dead & disappointing—so in effect did S. James. All the lights sank; my reed bent to the ground. Dead & disappointing—so I’m found out & that odious rice pudding of a book is what I thought it—a dank failure. No life in it. Much inferior to the bitter truth & intense originality of Miss Compton Burnett. Now this pain woke me at 4 am. & I suffered acutely. All day driving to Janet & back I was under the cloud. But about 7 it lifted. There was a good review, of 4 lines, in The Empire review [not traced]. The best of my books: did that help? I dont think very much. But the delight of being exploded is quite real. One feels braced for some reason; amused; roused; combative; more than by praise. Of course I was pleased when L. said none of our friends read The Listener. Anyhow, my spirits rose, calm & steady; & I feel once more immune, set on my own feet, a fighter.

No one has written to me. So I feel that buffeting is over, & I can make a fresh start. Still only Desmond to come—if he is to come: & then perfect freedom.

A very interesting visit to Janet. Both of them as spry & gay & even charming to look at as possible. Janet rounded & mellowed, with the beautiful——telephone: Keynes’s: Maynard is reading The Years. & is enthusiastic. Well that does please me, all the same—For one thing it gives more ply to 3 Guineas. Now I’m making up my Broadcast: whose date we’ve tried to change: but to continue with J. & E. A little thatched sunny house, full of nice furniture. Emphie with those lustrous eyes, as if she had always lived her life. She is completely at her ease; voluble; human, spontaneous. Flitting as usual from room to room interrupting, but as naturally as a bird, one eye spilling tears; but no gloom about—a natural gaiety & fun. Its true Janet is apparently dying; but they dont know how long she’ll be at it. Such a bore, she said, to have got this ulcer just as we’d planned to have a nice old age together. So many things we wanted to do. They had meant to go to Holland & look at birds. Nor was this a pose; no stiffness about it, quite natural. So we had a sip of talk with Janet—then with E.: E. says she can’t believe in death ending things—whats 70 years? So short—so short—Whats it all for I ask if it ends now? Oh no we go on—I’m convinced of that. It cdn’t be possible otherwise—so senseless—all the time balancing one elbow in a grey jumper on the edge of the table; a tear running. Now Janet dont believe this—she dont go to Church. I do. I’ll just see if she’s ready for you. Yes, we’ve always been poor. But then we made up our minds—we wdnt go to Theatres, we wdnt have clothes. We’d have good food—my mother always said that was so important for the young—& then we had to earn our livings. That was so interesting—made you know interesting people. Very few girls in our time had to work.

With Janet gossip, rather straitened, owing to time, about the past; the present; her belief, owing to Heard’s book, in some sort of life in common, not as individuals. Some mystic survival. The young wanting it. No religion. Katherine Asquith offering to come: but I doubt if she wants visits. Quite happy, some discomfort, cant sit or walk.

What is so odd is the switch over from thinking oneself a bad writer (after Muir) to thinking oneself a great writer (after Myanard). On the whole, being a bad writer gives one a greater feeling of freedom: but not the same glory. Difference between one’s back to the wall & soaring with pinions through the dominions ..—soaring with supreme dominion—how does it go?—the most liquid line in poetry."
1937.04.03,"Now I have to broadcast on the 29th. It will go like this: cant be a craft of words, am going to disregard the title & talk about words, why they won’t let themselves be made a craft of. They tell the truth: they arent useful. That there shd. be 2 languages: fiction & fact. Words are inhuman … wont make money, need privacy—Why. For their embraces, for their to continue the race. A dead word. The purists & the impurists. There are only impressions; not fixations. I respect words too. Associations of words. Felicity brings in absent thee. We have to can easily make new words. Squish squash: crick crack: But we cant use them in writing"
1937.04.04,"Another curious idiosyncracy. Maynard thinks The Years my best book: thinks one scene, E⁠[leanor]. & Crosby, beats Tchehov’s Cherry Orchard—& this opinion though from the centre, from a very fine mind, doesn’t flutter me as much as Muir’s blame; it sinks in slowly & deeply. Its not a vanity feeling; the other is: the other will die as soon as this weeks number of The Listener is passed. L. went to Tilton & had a long quiet cronies talk. Maynard not well; cramp in the muscle of the heart. His toes curl up. Lydia anxious. Queer, since he said at Xmas he had never been so well. Talk of what to do for Julian, who strikes everyone as depressed. Oh & no papers this morning—what a curious spite against me, to keep me mildly frizzling all day. But after all, if Desmond does me he will only be mildly avuncular & depressing. Most likely he wont do me. Oh to be quit of reviews! Reading Balzac with great pleasure. Novel reading power is coming back.

Maynard said that he thought The Years very moving⁠[;] more tender than any of my books; did not puzzle him like The Waves; symbolism not a worry; very beautiful; & no more said than was needed, hadnt yet finished it. But how compose the 2 opinions; its my most human book: & most inhuman? Oh to forget all this & write—as I must tomorrow."
1937.04.09,"“Such happiness wherever it is known is to be pitied for tis surely blind.” Yes, but my happiness isn’t blind. That is the achievement, I was thinking between 3 & 4 this morning, of my 55 years. I lay awake so calm, so content, as if I’d stepped off the whirling world into a deep blue quiet space, & there open eyed existed, beyond harm; armed against all that can happen. I have never had this feeling before in all my life; but I have had it several times since last summer: when I reached it, in my worst depression, as if I stepped out, throwing aside a cloak, lying in bed, looking at the stars, those nights at Monks House. Of course it ruffles⁠[?], in the day but there it is. There it was yesterday when old Hugh came & said nothing about The Years. He has grown fatter, coarser. I did not feel him so genial: a little vulgarised I think by Hollywood. Isherwood came. We chattered, about the Royal family: Hugh is to report the Coronation for the Daily Mail, & will get £200 for 2,000 words. Then he told us the true story of Frank Vosper & Mr Willes—sodomy—a sudden impulse—over the ships side: how his face grew; he was afraid of being a monstrosity. This is what I milk Hugh for. But his stories will get a little battered. He has Mr Davidson, the parson in the barrel to lunch calling. Not much real interest in human nature in Hugh. Always something irking him. Still the party went very briskly, & when it was over I walked round the Square, the first summer evening walk, & admired our patriotic beds of red, white & blue hyacinths. We go to France in May."
1937.04.14,"I must make myself correct Gibbon & send today. But after those months of correction, correction almost makes me cry out in agony. So to ease myself I’m taking 10 minutes rapid writing. I’ve done, that is scribbled down, my BBC essay—with some exhilaration. Old Ethel came to tea [on 9 April], & left her thorns in my flesh. Said I was the strongest of women, by way of hinting that L. & I had kept her away at Rodmell on a pretext. But I did not write & tell her so; No: I’m sunk in privacy in quiet. How strange! It would be flat, if I were not active in the head. Not a letter this morning: only 10 or 11 perhaps about The Years since it came out. Nobody talks to me about it, nobody now writes about it. It seems Sold I think 9,300 to have sailed out of sight. And I have some foolish shrinking from meeting anyone who would talk, or not talk of it. Yet it sells—best of all my novels. H⁠[arcourt] B⁠[race]. in America have sold 12,000 before publication—easily my record. Honestly I do not know what to think of this book: is it good or bad? Honestly I am floored—& so will not think, but cut back as quick as I can to 3 Guineas. Fresh as June dawn in my head again. Another run ahead of me.

And tonight Kingsley Martin, Stephen Spender & Julian dine. K.M. in an agitated voice on the phone asks L. why I wont write for NS. is it money? They propose to increase my fee & also offer more space. So what am I to say then? The truth?"
1937.04.15,"And Stephen says The Years is the best of my books, & Kingsley also—but that don’t please me. Stephen does. Not so much as it should. Yet soon I can cast up my accounts about The Years: add, subtract & cast up & say no more. A long close political argument. Julian, KM, Stephen—all calling each other by Xtian names. What is our duty? What is the responsible man like KM to do? Cant be a pacifist; the irresponsible can. I sat there splitting off my own position from theirs, testing what they said, convincing myself of my own integrity & justice. K.M. very neurotic, dark eyed, melodramatic. A much travelled too easily agitated superficial man—all froth & feeling—self questioning—not rooted. Julian peppery & pithy—making his strange faces, suddenly hooting with laughter—uncouth rather, yet honest, yet undisciplined, yet keeping something up his sleeve. Obstinately set on going to Spain—wont argue; tight; hard fisted—has amusing phrases “joining for duration of the quarrel”. Harry Pollitt cuts up rough when asked to arrange Tony’s & Stephen’s amours—not unnaturally, as KM. said: being in control of the CP in this war—being ravaged by deaths: pestered also by relations. The CP will only accept those who are devoted to The Cause. KM. lives much in the military area; so we discussed hand grenades, bombs, tanks, as if we were military gents in the war again. And I felt flame up in me 3 Gs. wh. has been submerged by Gibbon & BBC—that I should revise now, but cant screw this morning, after all that chatter. Stephen runs on too fluent, too formless; but as I say gave me a shock of pleasure. Says The Years gives him the sense of time; & is so precise—but he will write upon it in The Left Review. So thats the young on my side. Against: Vita; Elizabeth Williamson; Hugh Walpole; For: Maynard, Hayward, Kot, Nessa, Stephen; I refer only to the speakers not to the writers, whom to differentiate would take a whole morning. The complete absence of fan mail is curious. But America is now just beginning. And did I say that they sold—oh I think I did: & am rambling. Reading Balzac: reading A. Birrell’s memoirs; & now shall shut my Gibbon rather reluctantly: I wd. like to finish. Shall I begin another article? Scott’s letters?"
1937.04.21,"What a mercy to use this page to uncramp in! after squeezing drop by drop into my 17 minute BBC: wh. is alternately 25 & then 15 minutes. Curse the BBC. Also the N.S. They come pestering, & instead of lounging at MH. I made up an article on Gibbon’s Aunts. Why? Partly because of pressure, unconscious, from Leonard. However, on the whole MH was a good week end. Very cold wind. Went to tea at Charleston; & there found the whole family for once. Unfortunately Julian is dog obstinate about driving an ambulance; which casts a shadow over Nessa, & us too. There he’ll be keeping us all on the tenterhooks—But it wont be for 2 months, & what’s the use of looking ahead? On Monday we drove, round London, deviously, through the half dead old villages, to Ickenham: where Sally was almost surgically mated; the after marriage taking over 20 minutes. L. & the stableman & Mr Lloyd assisted: I, prudently, & chastely sat in the car & showed Mitz to the children. Then home to find Vita waiting—tomato red with one blue yellow eye: unconscious, easy & lazy as usual. We argued about Ethel. As she approached The Years—might have been written by somebody else—no wild poetry—in came L. to say Willie [Robson] must have his tea. So that argument was scotched. She went off to Curtis Brown; then to her first night of the Edwardians at Richmond; then Julian came with my glass fish: & then at last unpacked the car, slept over the fire.

Summer time began on Sunday: & I look up & see my clock still an hour late.

These little articles ruin ones time; today spoilt because I must finish off the talk & send to The Listener. Never again. Yet of course there’s a certain thrill about writing to read aloud—I expect a vicious one. And it could have been a good article. Its the talk element that upsets it. And in the pouring rain we went to Nessa’s; saw the D. of Kent pass in his emblazoned car, & then bought some of Julian’s Chinese pots."
1937.04.27,"Yes, that’ll be nice—to sit out of doors & drink, in some French town, away from all this. I ought to buy a dress; from Murray; but can’t be bothered. Opera last night: Raymond, Molly & Shaw Taylor: not as fine as it used to be; & a faded arty opera, Ariane. BBC rehearsal at 3: then Memoir Club. Sales slackening. Coronation impending. But on the 7th we’re off. BBC have asked L. to do a whole series. Never again will I read even one talk."
1937.04.29,"L. is talking about stock. “This oughtn’t to be here at all.. I have just done my BBC. Never again never again: “Somebody hasnt checked it properly” Well, we’ve decided to let the H.P. lapse or change next June. Yes I think, owing to Miss Lang⁠[e’]⁠s incompetency, that is now definite. Many things have happened—a crowd of little engagements—the pleasantest, indeed a happy one, was the Memoir Club meeting. We dined in a kind of sitting room behind the Etoile—& soon kindled, though it was a wet night: D⁠[uncan]. had a cold; Bunny the whooping cough; & Morgan dined with Forrest Reid. But Desmond was babbling as a nightingale—never have I known him in such jubilant good temper as this year. As if he worked only to enjoy to radiate. And my thimble of vanity was filled instantly because Maynard said my Gibbon was 20 times better than anyone elses; & praised The Years—a lovely book: & D. said he is going to write a long essay on me altogether, (but he wont) And then Molly & I kissed; & Maynard suggested that D. should give the L.S. lecture on L.S.: & we had a nice slice of savoury meat; & so round to the Studio. D. read a good account of his adventure at Florence, when he misrepresented Maynard. And then old Desmond ‘obliged’. That is he had a few notes in his hand, took a comfortable chair, & gave us with perfect ease & fluency & form a character of Wilfred Blunt & his own shooting. & so to the Trevelyans—how Sir G.O. came hopping loping like a great gorilla across the wood in the middle of the shoot to say Alfred Lyall’s poems are as near poetry as anything I can stand. Oh but it was beautifully done—& stopped when it might have gone on without boring us. Then Morgan read his condemned introduction to the Lawrence letters, which Bunny is now to do. And then we went off in the rain. Desmond said We’re not a day older, & we enjoy our society as much as we ever did. And Morgan said I felt so fond of everyone, I almost wept—I think he said that. Anyhow, it was a great success; & no nonsense about it.

Yesterday oh how Margery Fry snubbed me, by announcing, as she came into the room, that the reviews of The Y. had been so sniffy she was afraid it must have influenced the sales. This was said exactly as Dora Sanger says things. But I had hold of myself, & got some sparks out of her & then David & Rachel came, & I had the best bath of understanding praise yet had: D. said The Ys had helped him more than any book he had read; & was profoundly human, moving, & a triumph. & R. chimed in with perspicacious quotation. And I kindled & thought it genuine. BBC tonight: have put off the supper party & shall get through no doubt tolerably. I rested my brain on Lotta Leaf last night, so slept & am freshened.
"
1937.04.30,"So we have reached the last day of this agitating month—far better than I could have foreseen. Doesnt the Lit Sup this morning finish its Centenary article by a reference to that great artist V.W. & The Years, & head it with the same immortal name? Why do they go out of their way to be polite, I wonder? If it weren’t for Julian going to Spain I should be wholly content on our French journey.

The BBC was moderately successful: that is I got my pecker up & read with ease & emotion; was then checked by the obvious fact that my emotion did not kindle George Barnes who [is] long & weary & reminds me of Adrian in his weary days (A. is no longer so weary—he had tea the other day & I found him sympathetic). But the bright bubble, the fly in the eye, & all the other effects—premonitory shivers & disgusts of that BBC gently subsided & vanished as I walked home through the cold streets alone, & thought that very few people had listened: the world much as usual. So great was the relief that I was very cordial to Barnes, & would have agreed to do another had he asked me. Remember, however, to refrain from that folly.

A very cold grey day; the Busmen threaten to strike tonight; streets laced across; camps & latrines in all the parks, like the Crimea; poles with silver hatchets along the pavements. The Queen told David [Cecil] that she went all ice at the thought of the Coronation; said the monarchy hadnt the same position as in the days of Victoria. They went to grand party—Harold’s—at B.P.: & agreed that the food was bad, & the wine delicious. King George’s hair curls; Queen Eth is growing fat; jewels were worn, & the Band played The Merry Widow in a back room. There are miles of corridors to be walked. Many guests came in taxis. They had Lord S.’s car. All the fiddles are tuning up. Barnes told me the BBC is having 150 microphones & observers along the route. I shall try to listen in from some French café. Seats are still to be had; my hairdresser’s assistant bought one for 15/- in the New Zealand Stand. Hugh Walpole is to be knighted. We are giving a youthful party—Spenders, Chilvers, Julian, Plomer on Monday: cut Sibyl & the Bob Cecils lunch, & leave on Friday—that is one week, in which I must settle the question of clothes. In the past month & a half I have written Gibbon; Gibbon’s Aunts; & the BBC, thus making I hope about £60: but oh such hard work. Gibbon remains to be copied out—the last turn of the screw. When I come back I shall instantly pounce on 3 Guineas & see what I can do.

Allington sneers at me on the BBC—too clever “for myself who am only a simple person”—& wrist watches were not invented in 1880—so the deans have their vanity, & if I say what I mean in 3 Guineas I must expect considerable hostility. Yet I so slaver & silver my tongue that its sharpness takes some time to be felt. This maundering must cease: I must face the weekend drive down, so calm & happy, now its all over.

L.’s doctor says the eczema is much better: a disease afflicting printers oddly enough: a man, Dr Rau, intelligent enough to play with theories he cant answer. Ewart refuse for some inscrutable reason to put in our new watercloset: Norris’s mechanations suspected; with what else can I fill this last blue inch?—sales of The Y. about 10,250; Amberleys going on for 300. Mr Pritchard thought me very original & amusing last night [on the BBC]. Stephen Spender thinks The Y. my best book: poetical in the right sense; Nessa’s show early next week. Shall I buy one? Am rather stingy at the moment. Now I shall stop"
1937.05.04,"The day mother died in 1895—that 37

5

42 42 years ago: & I remember it—at the moment, watching Dr Seton walk away up Hyde Park Gate in the early morning with his head bowed, his hands behind his back. Also the doves swooping. We had been sent up to the day nursery after she died; & were crying. And I went to the open window & looked out. It must have been very soon after she died, as Seton was then leaving the house. How that early morning picture has stayed with me! What happened immediately afterwards I cant remember.

I’m jaded after our youthful party—they stayed till 12.45. The Bus strike on, so that they couldn’t get buses—had to walk. The streets look odd, all aflutter with banners—white in Bond Street, red at Selfridges; & no omnibuses; a lower level in the streets; all taxis & innumerable private cars; & droves & herds trudging the pavement. I went to Murray’s smart new shop in Grosvenor Street; should never have faced it if I hadnt known him in his shabby days: a lovely 18th Century library turned into a work room with long trestle tables, & some big tree on the garden wall outside. Women—middleaged fat thin short paraded like Ascot horses for my very shy & incompetent observation. I felt the lure of clothes again. Ordered a dress—was tempted to get a coat too. But cant yet feel rich again: tho’ they say The Years is in its 4th printing in America: only an advt. though, & H.B. not so scrupulous as we are. Then had to ford my way along Oxford Street, but the legs & shoulders so pressing & bothering I took to the back streets; finally the Tube; was shoved in at one door, pressed out behind a stout kind man who said “Barge after me”—why “barge”? to what social strata does that word belong? Public school, I think (by the way no letters about my BBC except private ones)

The party though—jaded as I am I must refer to the party. Sally: Julian; bell rings: the Spenders; Chilver: William. So we were crowded—no fire: a hot spring night. Julian was bitter at dinner against the B⁠[loomsbur]⁠y habit of education. He had been taught no job; only a vague literary smattering. But I wanted you to go to the Bar, I said. Yes, but you didn’t insist upon it to my mother, he remarked, rather forcibly. He now finds himself at 29 without any special training. But then he objected, as I thought, to all professions. An argument in favour of my ½ professions. Sally agreed. Downstairs we found Inez; controlled; small: of the Greek horse type; a little fixed & rigid; shy I daresay; in a red dressing gown dress: very silent; precise. William immensely fat; as if just taken off the Brighton pier: jubicund: much Hugh gossip & banter; H. is becoming a Knight, tho’ I know you’ll laugh. I was in favour of his Autobiography Julian against it. The Chilver sat all inhibited & nerve drawn, so I had to give him claret & sit by him & make party talk, about carpentering & bulbs. He wd. like to leave the Air Ministry & become a carpenter—make good chairs—but of course wont & cant, though Sally urges. Another aspect of the professional question. Air Ministry long hours, hard work; but regular & safe. Julian now all in favour of a settled job: even the Treasury. He is learning the mechanics of lorries. Hadn’t even been taught that at Cambridge—only the eternal Pope—wh. I scrambled through as a child. Poor old Julian—rather on a crazy edge of life I feel. And then there was some well informed political talk to which Inez contributed, dispassionately, sensibly. I daresay there’s something to her; but why they chose to connect themselves forever—she & Stephen—God knows. Seemed to me completely separate: he critical, polite, unintimate with her.

Every moment till we go seems now numbered like stones in a building—& thats why I shall be so relieved on Friday—no numbers of any stones for almost 3 weeks—And then—Still more must this be true of L. who, with every moment plotted has to endure the actual presence of Mrs Jones, who stumped round on foot just now, employed by Dr Jones. Reminds me of Mrs Cartwright & the General strike, arriving on a rusty bicycle. Desmond is going to do L.S. on the 26th May. Shall I go? in my new dress? Nothing from the TLS about Gibbon: but Dadie writes that G. Trev. approved. Odd how recognition eddies about. Now to write to Susie Buchan."
1937.05.25,"These are the rough and rapid chronicles of our last French voyage which to fill this distracted morning I will try to copy here.

For example: the first vines are to be seen at La Chemille; that is on Sunday the 8th May 1937, driving from Dieppe on a fairly fine morning. Also the road ahead looked like a white steeple. Then at rising straight up. Uzerche where we stayed we saw a woman sewing a white cloth on the banks of the river. She called the cows which obeyed. The river had a fresh lip. The flowers were like an Elizabethan meadow. A man chopped wood in the wood above. I could hear the hollow sounds. No other sound. And a boy showed us the way, opening the door of a great barn. Also that day we punctured and the man at the garage, talking about Mitz who was always our introduction to humanity, said how he’d been in Gambia, and longed to be there not in this dead alive French village; where his wifes parents made him live.

So to Souillac. There it became two hundred years ago. There we sat on the banks of the Dordogne in the evening and saw the man in the great hat and gaiters, and women washing clothes on the shingle. There was a cabin built against the rock like a scene in a play; and a man sitting there while the women went in and out. All this I said happened two hundred years ago. The castle was Cromwell Road; but had a chapel and soft brown roofed barns. Roofs here like high felt hats pulled down with a dent in the middle. Chapel reminded me of times of Rousseau. Man went fishing. Peasants employed perhaps By the great house. Sudden violent storm—as usual. Climate here ‘temperamental’.

The perfect day.—May—I forget what. Hot. To the Caves [Les Eyzies]. The brownish red tracings of prehistoric animals half rubbed out by children who used to play here, until someone from Paris came and looked for these pictures. All this country very classical with its poplars in straight decorous groves; and the hills beyond. Then I had a bad time in an antiquity shop—very nasty people the old furniture sellers everywhere. Liars and spiders catching tourists. Had to buy a five shilling plate to be quit and not popular at that. The cupboards only cost £3 but couldnt be sent. Man did bad drawings of Paris life—youthful memories, stupid and imitative. The vanity of an artist and the avarice of a peasant. But I saw their bedroom which interested me. W.C. opening out of it. Then it became very hot. A town crier went round Souillac beating a drum announcing a play by Loti. Both were upset from eating truffle perhaps. Great day at Meyronne, where I wish to live—up in the castle. An old woman shredding salsify. Talked about wild boars—sometimes killed; quite tame; they eat them. Church full of flowers for the Pentecôte. The farm with the great pigeon house; all these old things not preserved but used and allowed to fall into decay.

Sunday was the fête. People in bright clothes. Villages full of black men, standing about. The lady like the Princesse Lointaine going into the ruins. Farm carts in the cloister. A little girl who lived in the cloister and caught snails for Mitz. On 17th May I was thinking about action; how far directed or dictated by publicity motives, therefore largely impure, while we took in petrol at Villefranches: on road to Albi. Cold cloudy day. Left Souillac in a state of wild distraction. Madame like Sibyl C. at a party, doing accounts, answering questions about cheese, about bills, &c. Umbrellas open on the Place; people dining out there. Very bad dinner owing to crowd the night of the feast. At last the diners were so many we got up and left. Bank Holiday in France. Then to Najac—sordidly medieval; bossed; with great beams; and muffled grinning heads; round a mediaeval fountain. No place for human beings to live in—the middle ages. Houses perched on top of cliff. River flattened out beneath. An unreal dead crawling quiet, as if they were inhabiting an old shell. The old men gossiping with their pointed walking sticks. No life; no shops; dirt and misery. Albi on a very wet bank holiday. A flashy hotel; circle of blue and red electric light in the hall which went in and out. Bad dinner. The worst hotel yet found. Walked in the rain. Cathedral magnificent—like factory in red: firm, fluted, rock-like, painted within. And so on. Rain all night. Room thick with dust. Walls stained—bugs possible. Off to Rodez now in a northern hill country. Houses changing. Still the helmets.

At Rodez the best hotel in the world. Spirits sprung up. A long walk after tea. Sat and looked at the mountains, over the very green flat nightingale valley. No Coronation movies. Reading Elle et Lui, a very good best seller [by George Sand]. Cant stop reading. They say May is always stormy. Oh a very fine rust red cathedral at Rodez. In a valley—I suppose, stopping for petrol. The Dordogne running through a meadow; very steep green brushed hills; mob headed trees. Cold and grey.

Reading Beckford by [Guy] Chapman [1937]—but why write about this cold egotist? this nugatory man? A chirp of birds and grass hoppers. Aurillac first class hotel. Dinner of character; fried eggs, ham and rice. Choc, cream with biscuits floating. Aubergines with chopped bacon and gravy; also stuffed with cheese dressing. Am forgetting English words like artichoke. Rather a dirty sky. Now on to Toulle [Tulle].

Cold, cold and wet; slept in the village of Treysac—but how do you spell it [Treignac]? Went walking to the top of the mountain to find the druid stones; all drenched green under trees; cuckoo calling; a little shepherds farm; rain coming down in full flood; as we went up following arrows, paths twisting; divine views all misted and shrouded; green lit. Had to stop, wet to skin, plod back; change; dine for 2/-; but left hungry, so to bed; no chairs; clean little place, should be seen again so lovely was it even then; still raining—now we are driving to Gueret and now I am thinking about 4 dimensional character: different aspects to be given—not the one personal intensity. But what on earth do I mean? Not I hope to excuse my own limitations; see Desmond in Sunday Times; who as usual depresses me beyond reason. Conversation at Vallensay [Valençay] about Talleyrand. D. of Valensay. No he’s not very good, not very bad. Has no children, divorced—his wife was an American. Mlle Worth—some such name. Comes here. Keeps birds, zebras for his pleasure; has a hotel at Paris. But you should see his zebras. Great nephew of the great Talleyrand. Very rich.

Lost spectacles at Beaugency—the perfect town on the Loire. Maintenon 50 miles from Paris; old claws of ruin against the bright evening sky after dinner. Birds singing; many nightingales, very fine and pure. All silent and unspoilt. But this has rapidly changed. 50 miles an hour. C’est un oustiti—un petit singe. Est-ce qu’il est dangereux? The same talk we’ve had at every town: shows the poverty of the human race. Blazing hot taking in petrol. Lunch Rouen in a sq. off the Cathedral. No salt, the English say. I give them salt. Now petrol running out. Hot sun, but this Brighton Road empty, flat, uninhabited. Boudanville 8k. Le Havre 73k. Mitz here gave her last representation as I hope. Last petrol taken. Anxious about Maynard to the extent of dreading post or buying a paper. Old wounds twinging. Still a very good end to journey. No bad news of Maynard at Dieppe; a good hotel the Rhine; man who talked fluently and intelligently after dinner about South Africa; mines; diamonds—how different from rubies; about fish; about soles and the French taking fish from Grimsby; about cooking; his wife used to cook; now lives at residential hotel; a biologist; round; chubby; spry; very objective and interesting about facts; would like to talk to innumerable people in hotels about their jobs. Night boat; calm sea; arrive at Newhaven; the Customs find cigars in the other car; pass us; we breakfasted at the Bridge Inn; on eggs and bacon; so to M.H. all very private and quiet; and glad of chairs and intimacy and the garden lush with grass and fruit trees not standing the comparison at all badly. Sally jumped at L.; deserted Percy. Now to London for two days and another week here."
1937.06.01,"Monks House.

I have at last got going with 3 Guineas—after 5 days grind, re-copying & to some extent re-writing, my poor old brain hums again—largely I think because I had a good long walk yesterday & so routed the drowse—it was very hot—At any rate I must use this page as a running ground—for I cant screw all the 3 hours; I must relax & race here the last hour. Thats the worst of writing—its waste. What can I do with the last hour of my morning? Dante again. But oh how my heart leaps up to think that never again shall I be harnessed to a long book. No. Always short ones in future. The long book still wont be altogether downed—its rever⁠[b]⁠erations grumble. Did I say—no the London days were too tight, too hot, & distracted for this book—that H. Brace wrote & said they were happy to find that The Years is the best selling novel in America? This was confirmed by my place at the head of the list in the Herald Tribune. They have sold 25,000—my record, easily, (now I am dreaming of 3 Guineas) We think if we make money of Monday 14th Jun. The Years still is top of the list.

Monday. 12th July The Years still top of the list & has been weekly.

Aug. 23rd: Years now 2nd or 3rd 9 editions

Yesterday Oct 22nd, it was last on the list. buying perhaps an annuity. The great desirable is not to have to earn money by writing. I am doubtful if I shall ever write another novel—Certainly not unless under great compulsion such as The Years imposed on me. were I another person, I would say to myself, Please write criticism; biography; invent a new form for both; also write some completely unformal fiction: short: & poetry: Fate has here a hand in it, for when I’ve done 3 Gs—wh. I hope to have written, not yet for publication tho’, in August, I intend to put the script aside, & write Roger. What I think best wd. be to work hard at 3 Gs for a month—June: then begin reading & rereading my Roger notes.

By the way, I have been sharply abused in Scrutiny, wh., L. says, calls me a cheat in The Waves & The Years; most intelligently (& highly) praised by Faulkner in America—& thats all. (I mean thats all I need I think write about reviews now; I suspect the clever young man is going to enjoy downing me—so be it: but in private Sally Graves & Stephen Spender approve: so, to sum up, I dont know, this is honest, where I stand; but intend to think no more of it. Gibbon was rejected by the N. Republic, so I shall send no more to America. Nor will I write articles at all except for the Lit Sup: for whom I am going now to do Congreve.)

It has been August hot; Nessa came over & we had a long natural gossip. Maynard has been very ill but is better. Must rest for 6 months. Duncan in France. We stay here for one weeks perfect solitude. Then a London season, very hectic I guess. I should make a note of Desmond’s queer burst of intimacy the other evening. He came, was waiting, the evening we arrived—last Tuesday that is; read us his L⁠[eslie]. S⁠[tephen]. lecture, a rather laboured but honest but perfunctory lecture: after which he & I sitting in the twilight with the door open, L. coming in & out, discussed his shyness: he says he thinks it made him uncreative. Could he have told his intimate friends his private life it would (for some reason) have freed, enriched him. But he was shy; afraid of sinking in our opinion. Not surface shy of course; but heart shy. Reference to his mistresses. He then asked if I thought he had still power to write a good book. What could he do with his wretched stump of life? I said write your private thoughts, not autobiography. And tell us your private life. He said Oh yes, I’ll come & talk to you. And I’ll write it you. I felt something uneasy, trying to express itself; egotistical, weak I daresay. I think I see why he has been so fluent, so friendly, so embarrassingly anxious to be on some warmer footing, this last few months. Its his pressing need to write a good book somehow to assert himself before the stump of life is thrown on the fire. But how far am I sincere in thinking that he can? Isnt there a fatal softness, flabbiness; now gone too far? But how can one judge? Thats my note—not altogether satisfactory, & leaving it unshaded—the picture of D. now in my mind—my affection, my unintimate, but all the same genuine affection for him. He repudiated Maurice Baring or—some titled lady I think—as ‘friends’. Said his most intimate friend was G. Moore: but was shy with him. Could not ask him that is, if he had found marriage disappointing. D. is decided that he has. Mrs M. a woman who will drag in education.

Lady Simon, too, another visitor those crowded days, will drag in education. She sent me a report, private, of the meeting at Newnham to discuss the great question if gowns should be worn. This is connected with the question, is it time to ask the U⁠[niversit]⁠y to admit us? And she says, next time, if ever, you are asked to lecture, please print your answer; her wish being that the question should be frankly & rashly posed—by me, in default of Girton & Somerville. Well, perhaps, if I can bring off 3 Gs. But can I. Down here—now cold—I scribble & traverse miles of argument as I walk through Tristrams Grove to Piddinghoe. Mr Gwynne’s cows wear brown holland coats. Oh so hot yesterday: today the air splintered into arrows & the sun muffled & whitened. Mary H. asks me to dine to meet the Duff Coopers. Courage bids me say Yes. But my hair? & my dress?"
1937.06.11,"Brain rather dried up after 6 days strenuous London. Tuesday dinner to meet Duff Cooper; Wednesday Ethel Smyth; Thursday Nessa & dressmaker; Friday Harcourt Brace. So I’m running in a circle, having got on to the university chapter a difficult one. Very very hot. Very noisy. The hotel dancing: buses everywhere; a hop & frying [?]. And on top, Julian gone to Spain on Monday: & on Tuesday, news that Wogan was wounded, a man with him killed. So, a strain: which I cannot now go into: & it must last—how long? A year? Who knows? Anything to keep talking, inventing, distracting."
1937.06.16,"Apostle Night last night: a good one L. says. Sydney’s son made one of the best young man speeches. But I have not heard much gossip yet, since it lasted till one; & the morning is given to business. Just finishing the education section: much re-arranged. Then I shall have a few days flutter, I think. Congreve perhaps.

Helen dined with me: & the night before I dined with the Camerons, & heard Tony’s version of Mary: looks like a gnat, or a jerboa; prominent startled blue eyes, hands held like a jerboas. A pale pretty Shelley imitation American girl there, who sat on the floor, at my feet, & unfortunately adores & worships & gave me primroses one day in the winter & her poems. Not a type from which I now get much kick. Yes. London is hectic. But I’m going to reserve the next few days for moodiness. Cant always be on the hop without shaking my brains dry. No news of Julian; cant go to MH this week end because Sally may accouche. We have laid down a mattress & clothes’ drying screens to protect her.

I’ve seen: the Hutchinsons: Diana [Cooper] beautiful, veiled, easy going. Desmond there. Then Ethel Smyth: with her rough old claws scratching. Sniffing out 3 Gs. Then to the Coronation film, bits & bits; some good; others not. Then to Herbert’s on Sunday; oh the ugliness of that perfectly self-satisfied passive stockbrokers life: the Wyandottes, the orchard, the picture—the coloured photograph—the mats, the maids, Freda soft & motherly with a cat for a child: unreal, padded, easy .. & we walked at Staines. Then Adrian after dinner, on a visit of friendship. Then the Bowen, Bowras, Butts; then Helen … Now lunch."
1937.06.20,"An odd thought strikes me, now that I think so much of conduct &c. (for 3 Gs). Why does one secretly desire the misfortunes of one’s friends? It is a cold grey day, & secretly I’m pleased that the Bells are at Charleston & we in London: I mean I’m glad that they should have a bad week end. Yet this kind of gladness is not so pleasant as the other. But after splitting meanings in my Congreve, I dont take this page in order to continue.

I have turned on my electric fire—now the sun’s out. Willie [Robson] is upstairs, & Mabel comes in to say, shall she buy sausages? I’m rather cross, since I had hoped to have one unravished day. Cant get on with my 4 Congreve plays. Last evening Ann Watkins forced her way in: offered me—I could see the bait put on the hook—£1000 & all expenses if I wd. go to USA & lecture 3 times weekly for 3 months. What about I asked. That they didn’t mind. The more personal the better: for instance, about my experience of publishing, bringing in my marriage—a happy one. At this, your husband, who is sitting in the audience, will cry BOO! Well we declined. I was to repeat the same lecture—not to read it, but to speak it. That was very important. And Aldous & Gerald Heard, those apostles of the inner life & peace & goodness, are touring the States doing this in duet. Lord lord! what an example for the Soul … & what a good quote for my book. I was amused by her perfectly frank commercialism. Money—money—money. Couldnt help liking her—so fat, so coarse, like a bathing woman still touseled & blowsy from the sea. “I’ve had a chequered career” she said. And told us how she had lectured to “nice young women … when I wasn’t one at all myself” she said. No: I dont think she’ll even be able to sell my stories for me. What they want & Don Brace wants is that I should come over & exhibit my person, & make money for Don & for Ann. And what would they spend the proceeds of my personality on? Drink I should say, looking at Ann’s cheeks. Don would presumably buy his daughter a new dress. And I dont want a thousand myself, if I pay for it by hearing a gramophone forever braying in my head. She was honestly disappointed; & I cdn’t finish my Congreve. And must now write & thank Margaret Keynes for a nice trusty old world letter about The Years.

I must add, we are waiting for Sally to give birth: so havent gone away: but is she even pregnant? L. asks again & again. He has made her a bed behind screens in his study. But she leaps & laughs."
1937.06.22,"Isnt it shameful to write here first thing, not to tackle Congreve? But my brain after talking to Miss Sarton, to Murray, to Ann [Stephen] gave out after dinner, so that I cdn’t read Love for Love. And I won’t do 3 Gs. till Monday—till I’ve had a quiet breather. Then the Prof. Chapter: then the final …

So now to draw the blood off that brain to another part—according to H. Nicolson’s prescription, which is the right one. I wd. like to write a dream story about the top of a mountain. Now why? About lying in the snow; about rings of colour; silence … & the solitude. I cant though. But shant I, one of these days, indulge myself in some short releases into that world? Short now for ever. No more long grinds: only sudden intensities. If I cd. think out another adventure. Oddly enough I see it now ahead of me—in Charing X road yesterday—as to do with books: some new combination. Brighton? A round room on the pier—& people shopping, missing each other—a story Angelica told in the summer. But how does this make up with criticism? I’m trying to get the 4 dimensions of the mind .. life in connection with emotions from literature—A days walk—a mind’s adventure: something like that. And its useless to repeat my old experiments: they must be new to be experiments.

Ann is a great sea monster. Her hair is bound with a fillet bought at Woolworth. She is sunburnt, sea kissed. What I mean is she’s like the figure head of the Aurora Jane. She & Richard (engaged?) ask us to supper on Monday. This pleases us, who are now teased & tried by invitations of every sort. The young are pretty ruthless though. Fierce & egotistical, also very sensitive. Ann said she shd. have taken a First: owing to politics took a third. I gave her 5gs. but she didn’t think it cost me much—certainly hadn’t read The Years.

Sarton had: disappointed; but a ‘greater book’ than Waves. Waves her cup o’ tea. Her cup o’ rose water—that is, she’s fine drawn, wd. be poetic, more gushing though in letter than in speech. She has a shrewd American vein: she ran a theatre for 3 years in N. York; but it failed so she took to poetry, & the Zoo: that is lives, for the summer, in Julian Huxley’s lodging at Whipsnade, writing a novel for Kot, & we had to promise to dine there. Ann Watkins is now hot on the scent of magazine articles, & wants another talk. But here my gorge rises. No I will not write for the larger paying magazines: in fact, couldn’t. In this way I put 3 Guineas daily into practice. For here’s Rosemary Beresford coming, & I shall tactfully cross-examine her about Eng. Lit. at Cambridge. Ann thinks Pernel far too conservative. Miss Cristal wants a chapel. Miss C. wont let them have gramophones. But they’re allowed out at night. We’re a poor college, she said casually, therefore cant join clubs. But I doubt if she sees the force of my arguments. She is absorbed in politics—communism—& Richard. According to her the scheme is to accept L⁠[abour]. P⁠[arty]. policy, of gradual revision: Edu⁠[catio]⁠n, wages; socialism; but to be ready to enforce it by force. Force may produce win what cant be won except by force. She instanced the Fr. Revn. I denied it. Its the glory of death in battle, not in childbirth that appeals to them; the spectacular; the limelight. But I shall investigate further on Monday."
1937.06.23,"Its ill writing after reading Love for Love—a masterpiece. I never knew how good it is. And what exhilaration there is in reading these masterpieces. This superb hard English! Yes, always keep the Classics at hand to prevent flop. I cant write out my feeling, though; must decant it tomorrow in an article. But neither can I settle to read poor Rosemary’s verses, as I should with a view to this evening. How could L.S. in DNB. deny C⁠[ongreve]. feeling, passion [?]—more in that one play than in all Thackeray: & the indecency often honesty. But eno’—

I went shopping, whitebait hunting to Selfridges yesterday, & it grew roasting hot, & I was in black—such astonishing chops & changes this summer—often one’s caught in a storm, frozen, or roasted. As I reached 52, a long trail of fugitives—like a caravan in a desert—came through the square: Spaniards flying from Bilbao, which has fallen, I suppose. Somehow brought tears to my eyes, tho’ no one seemed surprised. Children trudging along; women in London cheap jackets with gay handkerchiefs on their heads, young men, & all carrying either cheap cases, & bright blue enamel kettles, very large, & saucepans, filled I suppose with gifts from some Charity—a shuffling trudging procession, flying—impelled by machine guns in Spanish fields to trudge through Tavistock Sqre, along Gordon Square, then where?—clasping their enamel kettles. A strange spectacle—they went on, knowing wh. way: I suppose someone directed them. One boy was chatting—the others absorbed—like people on the trek. A reason why we cant write like Congreve I suppose."
1937.06.24,"A letter from Ott. praising my NS. Gibbon article [Reflections at Sheffield Place], Now I have observed that any of my friends who disliked The Years always praise my articles, by way of urging me to give up fiction, & I suppose to make amends to me for not liking The Years. She has been very ill; almost thought she wd I bought my 4 amber tubes as theyre called on Wednesday 23rd June. I want to see how long they last uncracked. have “waved us adieu” but is recovering at Tunbridge Wells. Pipsy reads Emma to her, & she reads H James to herself.

Last night was a hard & fruitless grind: that is, I cant see why Saxon shd have dropped Rosemary [omission] into our mill; nor was there much point in bringing the Finn—a flaxen honest girl, who spoke very little English, & couldn’t understand a third of what we said. Saxon himself maintained almost complete silence—benevolent, but self indulgent; lazy. Why? I asked again & again, and should have had even harder work if Ann & Richard Ll. D. hadn’t come in; Karin & Adrian on top, rather unharmoniously. So we tumbled & tossed. Poor little RB [omission], going to teach Eng. Lit. to children in the provinces. So I lashed out at teaching Eng Lit. Ann very spontaneous, ardent & rough, at the same time sensitive—a very attractive combination, with the beauty of a ships figure head—a little blown back & battered. Richard I suppose selfish, but amiable enough. Rebecca West asked us to dine that night. Well—I dont know if that wd have done better. Odd that Saxon was so insistent for so little reason."
1937.06.25,"To the Albert Hall meeting last night. The last I swear. Inaudible. Megaphone to those behind merely vociferates split words. A little family gossip. Nessa Duncan Morgan. Oh but I liked being introduced to Auden, who wanted Stephen to bring him up. A small rough haired terrier man: slits for eyes; a crude face; interesting, I expect, but wire haired, yellowish white. Charles Trevelyan &c. Then speeches. Then semi jocular money collecting; then an auction of pictures. One by Picasso: one by Kapp. All very stagey empty & unreal. Wogan with his arm in a sling: looked tragic when unwatched, so I thought, listening to the Basque children singing on the gramophone. Robeson sang: a sympathetic, malleable, nigger, expressive, uninhibited, all warmth. & the hot vapours of African forests. I took several snubs & benedictions; thus:—Bunny cold, Morgan indifferent, Auden warm, Sally friendly; Kingsley Martin uneasy—a man I dont like—so voluble, histrionic, & he drove us home, taking a hand off the wheel to gesticulate—a different style of driving from Leonard’s. I’m hurrying. Cant analyse. Off to MH. No puppies. A finer day. Olaf Stapledon has sent me his new book: wh. flatters me, as 3 papers say it’s a masterpiece; the 4th says its bad. But am I more genially disposed because he says he admires me? Oh for this perfect soul business: how can we pretend to it? Starting my Congreve: going to do it in 3 days at MH. Then back to 3 Gs. refreshed."
1937.06.28,"Home is the hunter, home from the hill, & the Wolves are back from Monks House. And much refreshed into, the bargain. Three solitary nights. Think of that! Was there ever such a miracle? Not a voice, not a telephone. Only the owl calling; perhaps a clap of thunder, the horses going down to the Brooks, & Mr Botten [farmer] calling with the milk in the morning. A hot sulphurous week end, as if a cloud of white dust were over Lewes. The red grasses cut. Hay in black marks on the hill. Some, in the meadows, still up to my knees, & able to cover me as I lay on the river bank yesterday. We got very hot trying to move a chair—for L. this time; but it stuck; Louie & I butted like rams; L. hauled like a horse. There it stuck half way up the stairs & was only moved, down again, by Percy in his best Sunday brown coat. (By the way he talks of leaving). Up at 7.30 this morning, picked a rose, & drove up through Wimbledon, as Wandsworth Bridge is mending. Wimbledon all lush & pastoral; a crowd in Portland Road, but back by 10.30, & at work on the Second Guinea by 11. It is now started, that very difficult chapter, but I was heartened by reading some of the first: saw it as 3 Chapters suddenly; & if I can drive my pen hard, might have it done by August. But theres a terrible lot of reasoning (for me) & fitting in of the right quotations. Roger waiting too. Letters from Altounyan, Mary Fisher—Willy is dead: saw it on Friday’s placard—& the dossier from Ethel Smyth."
1937.06.29,"Mrs Woolf will you do me a great service? chirped up that bright little bird Isherwood at Richard’s last night. It was to send a message to a conference of Int. Libertarians at Madrid. He was going with Auden & Stephen & Miss Townsend Warner. But he rang up just now to ask for Hugh Walpole’s number & said that the whole thing is probably forbidden by the F.O. owing to various incompetences. It was a hard youthful comfortless but honest & genuine evening, dining in R.’s front room with no blinds: a chicken he & Ann had cooked; asparagus fried by mistake—but he a very attentive quick witted host. And wine &c. And a cat & flowers. White walls, no colour. All tidy & bare. Ann in pink, handsome truculent, concealing some sensibilities, I suppose, of a feminine kind. An odd vessel for passionate love—I mean for tender considerate love. But there it is I suppose making her sometimes sharp. But much more mature. In came, or down from his room came, Morgan with the bright bird. Morgan on taking his coat off—a very hot night—revealed a round barrel. Has he suddenly grown a fat man? Rather silent, hopping pecking, skimming away as usual. Talk of the A⁠[lbert] H⁠[all] meeting & Madrid mostly. Morgan rose to £5 on the wings of Miss Brown. Rather glad of bed & sleep. But a good evening in its hard adolescent way. And Richard maybe not a desirable son in law, as Adrian says. I wonder: but cant wonder, must lunch. In full flush of 2nd Guinea now. Years still top. Even higher. 7th printing. But what does that mean? That I can buy a book case?"
1937.07.11,"A gap: not in life, but in comment. I have been in full flood every morning with 3 Gs. Whether I shall finish by August becomes doubtful. But I am in the middle of my magic bubble. Had I time I wd. like to describe the curious glance of the world—the pale disillusioned world—that I get so violently now & then, when the wall thins—either I’m tired or interrupted. Then I think of Julian near Madrid. & so on. Margaret Ll. Davies writes that Janet is dying, & will I write on her for The Times—a curious thought, rather: as if it mattered who wrote, or not. But this flooded me with the idea of Janet yesterday. I think writing, my writing, is a species of mediumship. I become the person. Then Society: Saxon’s Club dinner: Old Sir Wm. & Beresford. And the Nefs, Sybil, Butts, Sarton—so many faces. I cdn’t face the Bussys, tho’ I shd. have liked to meet Matisse, Pernel & the rest. But the clock strikes one."
1937.07.12,"To stop myself from thinking about 3 Gs. I will chatter here. A cold July: a grey skylight. Alone with Nessa in the studio last night. We are very gingerly in our remarks about Julian, & Madrid, I notice; but she begins to discuss politics. Always I feel the immeasurable despair just on tother side of the grass plot on wh. we walk—on wh. I’m walking with such energy & delight at the moment. The reaction from last summer years 9 months gloom & despair I suppose.

I went to Stoke Newington yesterday & found a study table in white stone on wh. James Stephen was carved, large & plain, as I suspect he was large & plain. A long inscription about Wilberforce & wife & family neatly filled with green moss on top of the study table. Next door to the old Church, which might be in a hollow under the downs, is Clissold Park, & one of those white pillared houses in which Grandpapa studied The Times while She cut roses—now it smelt of Clissold Park mothers; & cakes & tea; the smell—unpleasant to the nose—of democracy. Clissold Park runs to greyhounds [?], unlike Hyde Park. There is a stag, & some say a Kangaroo. I was much refreshed by all this."
1937.07.19,"Just back from MH. but I cant & wont write anything—too hithered & dithered. Also, I screwed my head tight—too tight—knocking together a little obituary of Janet for The Times. And couldnt make it take the folds well; too stiff & mannered. She died. Three notes from Emphie this morning. She died on Thursday, shut her eyes, “& looks so beautiful”. Today they are cremating her, & she had had printed a little funeral service—with the death day left blank. No words; an adagio from Beethoven, & a text about gentleness & faith, wh. I would have included had I known. But what does my writing matter? There is something fitting & complete about the memory of her, thus consummated. Dear old harum scarum Emphie will have her solitary moments to herself. To us she will always be a scatter brain; yet to me very touching, & I remember that phrase in her letter, how she ran into Janet’s room at midnight, & they had a nice little time together. She was always running in. Janet was the steadfast comtemplative one, anchored in some private faith wh. didn’t correspond with the worlds. But she was oddly inarticulate: no hand for words, her letters save that the last began “My beloved Virginia” always cool & casual. And how I loved her, at Hyde Pk Gate; & how I went hot & cold going to Windmill Hill: & how great a visionary part she has played in my life, till the visionary became a part of the fictitious, not of the real life.

An august Sunday: I thought of the Forest lying green in the sun, & Janet dead. But I thought—not much. Too hot & harrassed with fitting phrases. And I was badly beaten at bowls. The kitchen a great success—now green & cool, & the new window shows a square of flowers; .. Why, all these years, I never thought to lay out £20 on a new cupboard, paint & window, I dont know. Last year of course I was carefully drawing my poor limp horns in. And now Elizabeth Bowen thinks The Years—oh, all I wanted it to be. And Olaf Stapledon also, & so on. I’m now coming in for measured slow sound praise—a long article by Delattre pleased me—my deepest & strongest book—so that I can discount old Ethel, who hedges—& Vita who never hedges, but takes great rough leaps over all subtleties. I am scribbling to avoid my Congreve: to avoid deciding whether to finish that off this last 10 days, or storm the last section of 3 Gs. Cant make up my mind.

On Friday we went to Worthing. Mrs W. very plaintive. Would even like to try Dr. Alexander—have I noted—no I leave out all the interesting facts—that L. is trembling less & less—can drink his coffee steady—& has, at 56, cured a disease that has, I guess, moulded his life wrongly since he was 5. All his shyness, his suffering from society, his sharpness, & definiteness, might have been smoothed. I mean by this something mostly superficial, but possibly constricting underneath also. Mrs. W however was plaintive, & Alice solid, like a large tree in shape, & Harold, the gayest of the Wolves, said, No one ought to live after 80. Like a good fellow he does his share & more of the necessary chatter. But has now bought a farm, in order to become a venerable & protected member of society, not a hated rentier. Then a meeting at MH. where the Major, who talks to mice, & holds toads in his hand, treated us to the most drivelling murmured muddle I ever heard—about force, & religion, which is heredity, & I may say with your permission, what I mean is, its all a question of thinking isnt it, & you cant talk to a Spaniard, but you can to a Mahommedan, & thats what I feel, religion’s at the back of it, & one has to take orders, as I see it, but Sir, if I may say so, its a question of heredity—but I cant reproduce the shell shock Major; & cd. only keep from howling by fixing my eyes on a cigarette. L. summed up in a masterly flight—thats what I mean: & so concluded. Q. & I were dumb."
1937.08.06,"Monks House, Rodmell.

Well but one must make a beginning. Its odd that I can hardly bring myself, with all my verbosity—the expression mania which is inborn in me—to say anything about Julian’s death—I mean about that last 10 days in London. But one must get into the current again. That was a complete break; almost a blank; like a blow on the head: a shrivelling up. Going round to 8 [Fitzroy Street, Vanessa’s studio] that night; & then all the other times, & sitting there. When Roger died I noticed: & blamed myself: yet it was a great relief I think. Here there was no relief. An incredible suffering—to watch it—an accident, & someone bleeding. Then I thought the death of a child is childbirth again; sitting there listening.

No no, I will not go back to those days. The only thing was a kind of comfort in being there with Nessa Duncan, Quentin & Angelica, & losing completely the isolation, the spectator’s attitude in being wanted; & spontaneous. Then we came down here last Thursday; & the pressure being removed, one lived; but without much of a future. Thats one of the specific qualities of this death—how it brings close the immense vacancy, & our short little run into inanity. Now this is what I intend to combat. How? how make good what I protest, that I will not yield an inch or a fraction of an inch to nothingness, so long as something remains? Work of course. I plunged on Monday into Congreve, & have about done him this morning. And undoubtedly that sets the wheels running. Directly I am not working, or see the end in sight, then nothingness begins. I have to go over though every other day to Charleston. We sit in the studio door. It is very hot, happily. A hot bank holiday—a child killed at the top; aeroplanes droning. The thought of Julian changing so queerly, no so usually: now distant, now close; now of him there, in the flesh; now some physical encounter—kissing him surreptitiously: & so on. And then I had some relief when Tom rejected his essays, for I felt then I had not been merely spiteful, merely jealous. But how it curtails the future: how it reduces ones vision to ones own life—save for Q. & Angelica. A curiously physical sense; as if one had been living in another body, which is removed, & all that living is ended. As usual, the remedy is to enter other lives, I suppose; & the old friction of the brain; but now I must sum up, & try to get my accounts, that is my plans for working, in being again.

Well, theres 3 Guineas to finish: the last chapter, now I suppose its stiff & cold. But I will try that tomorrow: then polish off Congreve: then earn £200, so they say, with a story: & so to Roger this autumn.

Will another novel ever swim up? If so, how? The only hint I have towards it is that its to be dialogue: & poetry: & prose; all quite distinct. No more long, closely written books. But I have no impulse; & shall wait; shant mind if the impulse never formulates; tho’ I suspect one of these days I shall get that old rapture. I dont want to write more fiction. I want to explore a new criticism: One thing I think proved; I shall never write to ‘please’ to convert; now am entirely & for ever my own mistress.

Rodker is nibbling at the Press. At the first nibble, through John, we both shied so strongly, that I suspect we shall end by reducing the Press to ourselves, & keeping it for ever, reduced. Rodker is a communist. Any other hand in the Press is suspect at once. Today we go to Charleston: Clive is in France with Janis [Loeb]; Duncan has been in London; Nessa is alone today. A very hot day—I add, to escape from the thought of her.

“I shall be cheerful, but I shall never be happy again”

“I thought when Roger died that I was unhappy—”"
1937.08.11,"I have half an hour over, & may as well spend it here. ‘Here’ I always write about writing: I’m rather ashamed. But its to set a flame to the effort & the grind of the day this summer. Now we are in the worst of the time—I think I can recognise that. We dont talk so freely of Julian. We want to make things go on. Angelica & Q. come over to play bowls. We beat up talk. Its unreal. We provide amusement, L. & I: this makes us rather quarrelsome when we’re alone—the strain I suppose. The unbecoming stage of sorrow. And we are never alone. Graham on Saturday: Mrs W. & Ada on Sunday: the children: on Monday I went by train to Charleston. Thus I left L. alone: have I the right to leave L. alone, & sit with Nessa? She was again in the submerged mood. An atmosphere of deep grey waters; & I flopping like a dilapidated fish on top. Very hard work. Then A⁠[ngelica] came to sleep & yesterday was an odious London day. L. silent; house grimy; waking up: heat; heavy rough, burnt up heat. A. late; tea; drive back: great thunderstorm, dine at C⁠[harleston]. Nessa better. But now begins the visitor crises, so bothering this summer. Are the Maurons coming? Then Judith & Adrian. I hate these decisions, & L. is silent. So I write here, not about this, but about my writing, which is the only flame the day strikes. Actually [?] I’m offered £200 for 1,500 words in the Cosmopolitan. Shall I, shant I? Why make money? Another car, I suppose; another table; some new records & a dress. Familiar tune: Nessa’s children; my envy of them, leading to work. But no use in thinking—I mean in analysis. I shall have a long walk this afternoon, to Piddinghoe: walk myself serene; play bowls, read; & not think of little arrangements; I bought a 6d. Jeans on the Mysterious Universe: I’m reading George Sand quietly; a long novel that L. thinks good carefully for the Press: shd. read Congreve to complete my study, but have had no time—only got back from Charleston late. Have Auden McNeice in Iceland from The Times [Book Club]; also some French George Sand memoirs. So I can browse along. And a huge box of Roger’s articles. Endless unwritten letters—sympathy about Julian who stalks beside me, in many different shapes."
1937.08.17,"Not much to say. Its true, the only life this summer is in the brain. I get excited writing. 3 hours pass like 10 minutes. This morning I had a moment of the old rapture—think of it!—over copying The Duchess & the Jeweller, for Chambrun NY. I had to send a synopsis. I expect he’ll regret the synopsis. But there was the old excitement, even in that little extravagant flash—more than in criticism I think.

At Charleston yesterday in the rain. I take the train to Lewes; shop; 4.35 bus; reach Charleston for tea. Its true that I cannot write about Nessa: have to keep myself from thinking about her.

Happily—if thats the word—I get these electric shocks—Cables asking me to write. Cha⁠[m]⁠brun offers £500 for a 9,000 word story. And I at once begin making up adventures—10 days of adventures;—a man rowing with black knitted stockings on his arms.

Do I ever write, even here, for my own eye? If not, for whose eye? An interesting question, rather. I’m musing on the nature of Auden’s egotism. Suspect its something to do with uneasiness. He wants to write straight from the heart: to discard literature; egotism may be his way of orienting himself. What I mean I dont quite know, perhaps that it seems to him thats being honest, simple, naked, taking off literary clothes.

A letter from Tom; uneasily egotistic also. Or do I impute this? Eddy Playfair & the Maurons impend. The weather has broken. A great rain storm last night. [Southease] Bridge up as we drove back: a ship coming up. The river men running about in great coats with sticks like conspirators in the 17th Century. We talked at Charleston about America. Nessa made A. read aloud a description of a flood in Dr Heynes [?] book. She has read this with interest. She has a considerable detached imaginative power. This may help. Then A. & Q. But now & then she looks an old woman. She reminds me of father taking Thoby’s arm: so she asks Q. to help her. How can she ever right herself though? Julian had some queer power over her—the lover as well as the son. He told her he could never love another woman as he loved her. He was like her; yet had a I think I mean lack of judgement: obstinate & emotional. Eddie Playfair agreed. We shd. have respected him more if he had stayed in England & face drudgery. vigour, a roughness, & then as a child, how much she cared for him. I mean, he needed comfort & sympathy more I think than the others, was less adapted to get on in the world—had a kind of clumsiness, of Cambridge awkwardness, together with his natural gaiety. And thats all lost for the sake of 10 minutes in an ambulance. I often argue with him on my walks; abuse his selfishness in going but mostly feel floored by the complete muddle & waste. Cant share the heroic raptures of the Medical Aid, who are holding a meeting next week to commemorate the six who were killed. “Gave their lives” as they call it."
1937.08.25,"In London yesterday, & write here because I cannot force myself on with Congreve. I suspect its a failure. Or am I a failure? Not a question I intend to ask: since clearly one must act. In London yesterday, I began: & saw Dr Hart & Archie Cochran about Julian. Rather a physical distress than mental; about his wounds: as if one felt them bodily; Nothing new: only that he was conscious when they got him to hospital, & anxious to explain that the road was dangerous: then anxious to get on with the operation. He became unconscious, talked in French about military things apparently … & died 4 hours later. Why do I set this down? It belongs to what is unreal now. What is left that is real? Angelica in a yellow handkerchief picking dahlias for the flower show: that Edgar took a gun: & shot Churchill’s white dog: Nessa seemed ‘better’: that is could laugh & seem interested. But the reality is very shallow this summer. We had Eddie Playfair this week end & the Maurons & Helen [Anrep] for bowls & tea. I am dried up with talk, with compacting my 2 £200 efforts; one on USA: one a story; the Jeweller; now must do Congreve. Very hard work in its way, packing & pressing. I shall soon long for the space & irresponsibility of fiction.

Our telescope came last week. The erudite Eddy focussed it. We have seen Jupiter minus the waiting women: & a plaster cast of the moon. Fog driving home from Charleston last night. The robber caught at South Heighton.

Much forced talk with Hart & Cochran. Cochran a nice simple but rather tense (naturally) practical reddish young man; giving his account stiffly kindly: Hart a Jew; neurotic, rather shiny nosed, intellectual, with the professional surgeons manner. A conflict of sympathy, tragedy, professional manner, & social politeness. Queer rather. A very fine day. Now can I tackle Congreve?"
1937.08.29,"Yes I am tackling Congreve, because I want to be quit of all articles & ready for 3 Gs on the 1st.

How far would this energy of the mind carry me—could I take this narcotic successfully if Leonard died, if Nessa died? I come out here at 10 & dont wake to anything but Congreve till one. Go in with my head swaying like a captive balloon. The thing is theres no richness & security when I wake. No depth of happiness to refresh myself in. Considerable agility & gaiety & chatter. Mrs Curtis, William Plomer, Janie, Q. & A., over yesterday. Mrs C. reminds me of Jean Thomas: something spurious—showing off. She’s a highly successful liver: had £200: therefore borrowed, ran Langford Grove; lodges 10 people on top of Firle down; is adventurous, stack full of go & slapdash; but somehow not convincing as a character. Too smooth & slick & so on. A useful phrase when I’m writing in a hurry. A very hot August again. Bowls have become a passion. I gave up a walk to play. But then I’m anxious to vary the day. How independent I feel myself of tradition; & what to do next. Simply trust to life? I think Roger said he trusted life on the whole. I mean, no cut & dried rules possible. I must think out some autumn plans one of these days. We saw the Ring of Saturn last night, like a cardboard collar. The man is still at large. Mrs Curtis pretends that she is elemental: I think thats it, sets a meal out for him & entertains cosmopolitanly. Why does any showing off mildew everything? William was portentously stout, red, & healthy. He lives at Brighton for the breezes he says, & finds Cape’s MSS. distracts him from novel writing. But in fact, as the chatter was so incessant I had no gossip or silent listening with him. And now there is little to add, except that the British Ambassador in Japan has been shot: Santander has fallen; there is war between China & Japan; Clive is at Grenoble, & for 2 days I’ve had no letters, nor yet heard if my Jeweller is commissioned"
1937.09.02,"With this odd mix up of public & private I left off: & finished my Congreve, the end too crowded, but forced myself to take it to the post just as Q. & A. & Janie drove up to tea. And todays a holiday: letter writing; reading, how strangely—to hear his voice so clear from the other side of the grave—Julian on War. I hear his sharp quizzical laugh now & then: something like Clive; shrewd & biting. But as usual, the whirl of things, of things half grasped & sweeping on, like a staircase that for ever passes the platform—bewilders me. Why could he never force himself to think to the bottom of his idea? But I’m stopping in the middle; write here to make myself take breath. 5 past 12."
1937.09.12,"I opened this—then thought of 3 Gs: then of Julian’s essay: so wasted 5 minutes; & all I had to say was that The Duchess & the Jeweller is a firm commissn: therefore I have made £400 by these 2 stories, & we bought two fountains at Hand X going to M. in the wet. Now time up."
1937.09.26,"Tom & Judith here: therefore I am not writing the end of 3 Gs: which has kept me completely submerged from 10 to one every morning; & driven me like a motor in the head over the downs to Piddinghoe &c every afternoon from 2 to 4. Then we play bowls from 5 to 6. Then read. Then cook dinner. Then wireless. Then read. Then chocolates. Then bed. And so it begins again. But there have been so many interruptions, the specimen day is the exception. We went to Sissinghurst—unrecorded: with Eve A. & Q.: Vita with that silent goodness, & Harold too, a sense of the human understanding unspoken, & now that Gwen is not there, for me more unbroken. Many improvements: men digging; an Elizabethan drain being dug up. Lady S.’s money now supplies Vita with enough to store the house, which is too museum like perhaps. The red amber stood in the light: Persian pots: too many possessions. & then Vita shows that she inherits the magpie gift of her mother, but stabilised & dignified by the old honourable yet rather null Sackvilles. I’m drawing upon Pepita for this illuminating sketch.

Not a happy summer. That is all the materials for happiness; & nothing behind. If Julian had not died—still an incredible sentence to write—our happiness might have been profound. “Our”—L.’s & mine, now that The Years has sold between 40 & 50,000 in America; now that we are floated financially, & perhaps to shift the Press & take a new house, & privately as happy & rounded off as can be—but his death—that extraordinary extinction—drains it of substance. I do not let myself think. That is the fact. I cannot face much of the meaning. Shut my mind to anything but work & bowls. Now theres Tom & Judith, & I think I have solved the week end problem, & made it a reasonable & even enjoyable habit, as it should be—having friends in the house. Tom in some ways—with his sensitive, shrinking, timid but idiosyncratic nature—is very like myself. This morning, as Priestley’s play is praised, he is uneasy, as I shd be, & insinuates, as I should, distrust of critics, yet reads them, as I do, furtively. Tom is liverish looking, tired; but revives under the effect of Judith’s fresh & downright & able but not sophisticated, or I daresay, highly aesthetic, youth. She is a whopper: a strapper; yet with the usual complexities I think, submerged. I should however write a pack of letters; to Vita (who sent me Nessa’s little message: to me so profoundly touching, thus sent secretly via Vita that I have ‘helped’ her more than she can say) & to Chambrun, my employer: & to the Fabian [untraced], & others, for with the autumn letters begin, & publicity puts its rather heavy, not altogether unacceptable fingers on me. More letters than usual of praise & demands therefore."
1937.10.12,"London.

Yes we are back at Tavistock Square; & I’ve never written a word since Sept. 27th. That shows how every morning was crammed to the margin with 3 Guineas. This is the first morning I write, because at 12, ten minutes ago I wrote what I think is the last page of 3 Gs. Oh how violently I have been galloping through these mornings! It has pressed & spurted out of me, if thats any proof of virtue, like a physical volcano. And my brain feels cool & quiet after the expulsion. I’ve had it sizzling now since—well I was thinking of it at Delphi I remember. And then I forced myself to put it into fiction first. No, the fiction came first. The Years. And how I held myself back, all through the terrible depression, & refused, save for some frantic notes, to tap it until The Years—that awful burden—was off me. So that I have deserved this gallop. And taken time & thought too. But whether it is good or bad how can I tell? I must now add the bibliography & notes. And have a weeks respite. This may be provided by Mr Davis of Harpers Bazaar, coming to tea today to discuss a story suggested by that maroon coloured sharper, as we suspect him, M. Chambrun—whom I have not described—the agent who cabled about the Duchess & the Jeweller, offered £200, & I think will somehow wriggle out.

So nothing was said here of the last weeks at Monks House. The weather was very fine. That objective statement sounds a little odd. Nessa went to Paris. Last night she came here, for the first time. We have the materials for happiness, but no happiness. All this summer, I find myself saying that verse, Lowell’s, about those whose coming steps we listen for: the verse about the nephew killed in the war. When Thoby died I used to walk about London saying to myself Stevenson’s verses: You alone have crossed the melancholy stream. Both Yours the undiminished gladness undecaying dream. doggerel I suppose: yet they say themselves spontaneously. With Thoby though I felt we were the same age. With Julian it is the old woman, saying that she wont see the young again. It is an unnatural death, his. I cant make it fit in anywhere. Perhaps because he was killed, violently. I can do nothing with the experience yet. It seems still emptiness: the sight of Nessa bleeding: how we watch: nothing to be done. But whats odd is I cant notice, or describe. Of course I have forced myself to drive ahead with the book. But the future without Julian is cut off. lopped: deformed.

We have decided, gradually, completely, not to sell the Press; but to let it die off, saving for our own books. This is a good conclusion I think. It keeps the right to adventure; cuts off some money. We cd not face writing for publishers. Thus I carry out my own theories anyhow. And we get fresh scope for experiment & freedom."
1937.10.13,"George Davis came & commissioned a story I think. On top of him Philip Hart the Dr who was with Julian when he died. The facts now seem to be: Julian was brought in with a very bad wound—looked deathly white. He asked H. What chance have I? Hart told him 80 per cent recover. A lie. He had only the chances of a miracle. He was very brave. After the operation, H. saw him comfortably in bed. Went back 2 hours later & found him dozing half conscious. And so he remained till he died that night. Hart said Julian & the other man lay under the ambulance. They might, & could have taken cover in a trench. But it is impossible to take precautions always. Julian was hit by a side splash from a shell: the other man not touched. It was as if he were killed at once. The mind of a person so wounded is only on immediate things. He said nothing about Nessa. Was anxious to get on with the operation.

This does not tally altogether with the other accounts: P.H. & the others thought he was alone, & so on. But now there is no more to be discovered. Hart was tormented by some sense of guilt. That they had not kept J. from the front. They would have done so later. This was his first experience. Things are now much more dangerous. The Ambulance is almost as dangerous as the Army. And so he went. He said that the worst fighting is about to come. A long talk. Like Tisdall [VW’s dentist] to look at. A nice, sensitive thin man, an enthusiast. If we allowed arms thro we shd save thousands of lives.

& then I go upstairs & find L. enraged with the L. Party which sent a deputation to the F.O. & was diddled by Vansittart. So we shant let arms through: we shall sit on the fence: & the fighting will go on—But I am not a politician: obviously, can only rethink politics very slowly into my own tongue."
1937.10.19,"It came over me suddenly last night, as I was reading The Shooting Party,—the story that I’m to send to America, H⁠[arper’s]. B⁠[azaar]., that I saw the form of a new novel. Its to be first the statement of the theme: then the restatement: & so on: repeating the same story: singling out this & then that: until the central idea is stated.

This might also lend itself to my book of criticism. But how I dont now, being very jaded in the brain, try to discover.

What happened was this: when I finished the S.P. I thought, now that the woman has called a taxi; I will go on to meet, say, Christabel, at T. Square who tells the story again: or I will expatiate upon my own idea in telling the story; or I will find some other person at the S.P. whose life I will tell: but all the scenes must be controlled, & radiate to a centre. I think this is a possible idea; & wd. admit of doing it in short bursts: cd. be a concentrated small book: cd. contain many varieties of mood. And possibly criticism. I must keep the idea at the back of my mind for a year or two, while I do Roger &c.

This struck me just as the Spenders came to dinner. I was depressed. Why do I resent Stephen now that Julian’s dead?—the incredible words? Just before they came I found the lines in Lowell: Biglow papers: Its hard to see the young go fust, all brimming full of gifts & graces … whose coming steps there’s some that wont, no, not lifelong leave off expecting awaiting, (something like that). Then Stephen comes in: not Julian. Last time they dined, it was to meet Julian. Well, one must not think of this. Julian wd. have said, “But my dear—once he said sweetheart—(I suspect his word for his loves) its clear that you’ve got to go on & comfort Nessa.” Thats what he wd say at this moment. Oh Lord!

Well: I will go to Maples about chaircovers; to Highgate to see Roger’s house; & dream today, because I must unscrew my head & somehow freshen up if I am to write, to live, to go through the next lap with zest, not like old sea weed. Stephen talked mostly about a new magazine: another; to run 6 numbers; L. to write politics in each: as the unifyer [?]. & the H.P. to publish. But he wont; & the H.P. won’t. So it fizzled out. Then there was a good deal of politics: Inez a precise, horse headed woman, at last emerged. Talked of her Spanish book. Still an Oxford student. They had been seeing Ottoline. Not much gossip. A fog."
1937.10.22,"I am basking my brains. No I didnt go to Paris. This is a note to make. Waking at 3 I decided I would spend the week end at Paris. Got so far as looking up trains, consulting Nessa about hotel. Then L. said he wd. rather not. Then I was overcome with happiness. Then we walked round the square love making—after 25 years cant bear to be separate. Then I walked round the Lake in Regents Park. Then … you see it is an enormous pleasure, being wanted: a wife. And our marriage so complete.

To return to facts (tho’ this ‘fiction’ is radiant still under my skin): walked to see Roger’s Highgate birthplace: suddenly L. developed the idea of making the young Brainies take the Press as a Cooperative company (John [Lehmann]; Isherwood; Auden; Stephen). All are bubbling with discontent & ideas. All want a focus; a manager: a mouthpiece: a common voice. Wd. like L. to manage it. Couldnt we sell, & creep out? Thats the idea—& yet keep the soul, translated into this on the whole appropriate body? Anyhow, John was heard in the Press: consulted; interested; fights shy of money; £6,000: will lunch with I. & discuss. And now telephones he will come on Monday. So that fats a frizzling. Off now, not to Paris, but to the Grocer with the Cupid, so to MH, Q. & the L.P. meeting: a fair exchange for Paris, where, too, I shd. have met & mixed with Nick, Barbara, Saxon, & the Easdales. Nick, the lout with a veneer of 2nd hand Bloomsbury, came to tea, & considerably exacerbated me. He is having lectures on ways of improving his intercourse with Judith. Duncan gave me a green brooch. A fine day."
1937.10.25,"A terrific gale this week end. We went to Cuckmere, via Seaford; The sea over the front: great spray fountain bursting to my joy over the parade & the lighthouse. Right over the car. Then we walked down to the sea at Cuckmere; the birds came up like shots out of a catapult. We cd. not stand against the wind, the breath pressed out of us; nor see. We stood behind a shed, & watched the waves: a yellow rough light on them; pounding; a great curled volume roughened of water. Why does one like the frantic the unmastered? And the brooks streaked with white & blue lines; where the wind I suppose raised a long streak of drops. Also the drops were like the spurt made by a stone falling—shaped something like pinched up glass. The light over the marsh steel blue & tawny.

So to Charleston, wet & soaking. Saw Q. & Kapp as dry & merry as sandhoppers, & so bought muffins, toasted them, had tea; & a tree fell in Princes gap on top of Bannister’s lorry. Also the branch fell in the churchyard over the vegetables.

A meeting on Friday: Mr Hancock, Lyons &c. The new garden ready, save for the basins still to be embedded. The view is now clear through the walled garden to the down. Talk of Drawbell building: also building at Knotts Bushes—my Tristram’s Grove."
1937.11.01,"A damp depressed morning. So why not write here? Pouring; vanity hurt by the preference given to Morgan by Day Lewis in the Book Society News [not traced]. Why not V.W? Yes, thats the mean little worm that will nibble when I wake talk tired after yesterday. We went to Philip’s for lunch. We had dined at the Hotel—the 87th birthday party. So hot the clothes stuck to one. Abrahamson soliloquised. Most of the daughters in law munching like cows in a field. And poor Connie Ross in brown, with a trickle of ribbons, poised on an armchair like a much battered moth, the moth that has been attracted out of the even damper garden by the light & the noise. And we played whist. Then yesterday we went to Philip’s; a soft warm late summer morning: stopped at Milton’s cottage. Persuaded the cultivated man to show us round. Babs said “We want to consult you about Cecil”. The poor little boy wont say whats the matter. He takes no interest in anything. Wont turn & wave to her, or write to her; drudges on at Latin. Babs uninhibited. Simple. And the many ponies followed us round the garden. Not a happy family exactly. No high spirits. Attenuated critical children. Education weighing on Philip & Babs. A beautiful sweep of 18th century view.

So home. Wyndham Lewis Auby: hot mean reading. Exacerbates. Yet diminishes vitality. Thank God, it will be out of the house today. Dinner with Clive: Janis: Nessa, Angelica. I think poor old Clive even a little on the bare wheels; no blown up tires. That to me is very ominous [?]—if Clive’s spirits should give way—if he were to give up his enjoyment of life! We discussed education; dreams; N. & A. stitched at some private garment. A. alternately silent & decisive. Duncan came in. Not much boasting. I feel that N. has, with her bad eye, given up all hope of painting at the moment. She is querulous sometimes about my “success”. When I told her the actual figures—40,000—she was, I think, relieved (as I shd. have been in her place) to find them less than reported.

An odds & ends evening, neither one thing nor another. I am revising the 1st Guinea: shall send them all off, to be typed: show to L.: then provide notes. But no more this morning. The Co-operative Press hangs: I think the young are eager to bite. Pepita begins to boom; also Sally Bowles. Dick Sheppard died at his desk yesterday; just elected Rector some where. A pity, I expect; if peace is a cause, he had some gift that way.

On Saturday I “saw”; by wh. I mean the sudden state when something moves one. Saw a man lying on the grass in Hyde Park. Newspapers spread round him to keep off the damp. A cheap attaché case; & half a roll of bread. This moved me. So uncomplaining: a positive statement. He was asleep. Others lying near. The last time I ‘saw’ was at MH. last week end, when Louie was discussing the building at Knotts Bushes. My mother used to take us that way when we were children. She used to tell us how she walked from Telscombe to Newhaven to shop—a vision of the little caravan, absolutely private silent, unknown, going over the downs, talking. Ought one only to write about what one “sees” in this way? These sights always remain. Isherwood, now Christopher, & John, beg me to write a story for New Writing. A compliment. Suggestion: “Portrait of a Young man” but I’m so fed up with short stories. Todays the day of the deputation to the H of C. But the PM has the gout. Must I go? Cant I get out of it?"
1937.11.03,"Yes, I did get out of it: much to my regret next morning when I read that the deputation had been received by the PM in the Cabinet room at Downing Street. What a chance of “seeing” to have missed! But I had the sense to weigh my own peace over the fire with a book; & my freshness the next morning which sped me through the revision. So I cry quits.

To Southwark & Lambeth, walking, yesterday. A great autumn for long City walks this. I discovered St James Garlick hill: & St Mary’s Lambeth. A quiet day. Missed seeing David Cecil too. On the other hand Rosemary Hodgson rang up fr. The Daily Express to ask me to write a signed article. Its your name they want—& shant have. L. is writing a strong Letter to the Listener who cut his phrase about privacies⁠[?]."
1937.11.30,"Yes, its actually the last day of November; & theyve passed like a streak of hounds after a fox because I’ve been re-writing 3 Guineas with such intentness, indeed absorption, that several times 5 minutes past one has shown on the clock & I still at it. So I’ve never even looked at this stout volume. I have left out Cambridge: Peter & Prudence; the shiny busts; the bitter cold silent city; the chatter at Ann’s; Newmarket; Oh & people innumerable. Or so I think, for I have not time to re-read. A great strain; but how merciful a compulsion, so that I need not go into the sensation I have on drinking tea at 8 [Fitzroy Street] with Nessa. No, no, I will not describe that: dont I dread it? But I make myself all the same stay on when she’s alone. Innumerable people: the Hutchinsons, Katie Lewis, Adrian, Cecil Duckworth, Gerald’s relics still littering the drawing room. Some extravagances: Oxford Walpole bought off Hopkins at the Book Show: Vita there, signing, dabbing her lips red, with Gwen in attendance; my profound distaste for Harold’s Dufferin, its falseness; equal exacerbation from Wyndham Lewis & Nevinson’s autobiographies; strong effect of mean minds; & buying with some recklessness, fur boots, leather waistcoat, underclothes; for money once more brims the pot. I could make £100 by choosing books for the Pelicans, with Morgan & Hugh & Aldous, but have refused, by way of a snub to Lane 200 for shifting, sans apology, from Leonard to me. And I’m paid 200

120

120

25

465 by Cosmopolitan, 120 by H⁠[arper’s]. B⁠[azaar]: another 120: then 25: which adds up to 465. £465 for a handful of old sketches. This a little shames me in comparison with Nessa’s sales: but then I reflect, I put my life blood into writing, & she had children.

At Duncan’s show, we met the Bugger boys, Joe, Morgan, William; & savoured the usual queer scent. Joe the slave of The Listener. And what will the slaves say when 3 Gs. comes out? in March I suppose. Then the Webbs ask us to lunch to meet the Shaws. We fight shy; & are now asked to Liphook. A very foggy November: a trail of brown every day, keeping us at home of an evening. And one of these foggy evenings, Ethel Smyth came, & then Madame de Polignac, like a perfectly stuffed cold fowl (K. Lewis, with her white hands, plump, with emeralds, had that look too). Another evening Lady Simon came, commends my secret & nefarious projects: not to get anyone else into trouble. &c. And so the month has run through my fingers, with a walk or two: many letters & some divine quiet evenings. L. in his stall, I in mine, reading Chateaubriand now, bought in 6 fine vols for one guinea at Cambridge: also much random trash as usual, & many lives & some blue books for my little harlequin book; but no poetry I observe—no Shakespeare, because by instinct I suppose, & here must change by force to white paper, I want prose to quiet my brain. Or am I lazy? Now the sacred hour comes, luncheon: a wet damp day; & I must alas lavish my after tea time upon Eth Bowen, for all that I like her, a source of regret."
1937.12.15,"And then I had one of my little dips into the underworld—a temperature, sofa, 3 days recumbent, Monks House in a snowstorm; no walking; foot & mouth still dominant; back to our party. Young Newnham, all most free & easy, vigorous & inspiriting—Nat & Harry & George & Margaret & Ann Williams & Elizabeth somebody else [friends of Ann and Judith Stephen]—all sitting on the floor; & then—writing, writing; the 1st chapter taken on Monday to the Chancery Lane typist; cold & rain; visits from Mrs Woolf & Herbert, from John yesterday; the Press question looms & lapses; offers from Rodker & Seeker & even Miss Lange wd. like to buy; & our views change: secretly we both wish to fade, not to sell; but John is eager to buy, yet stingy; must consult Isherwood & Stephen; & settle by mid January; Vita, who dined [on 23 December], more matronly & voluptuous than ever, wont go in with them: a parcel of hot headed & ignorant boys;—well, no use trying to pull this five minutes before lunch sentence together so I stop it. I have spent £35 on a picture by Duncan, nervously; Karin has taken a house in Regents Park & is transported; Adrian & Katie Lewis hit it off very well at tea; Nessa & Angelica go on Sunday to Cassis. Christmas is on us, & owing to Lord Ivor’s gossip, I am once more riddled by invitations from Sybil. I hope to find an Italian oil jar & a column waiting upstairs."
1937.12.18,"Oh this cursed year 1937—it will never let us out of its claws. Now its L.’s kidneys: Rau says he may have a chill, or it may be something wrong with the kidneys; possibly the prostate gland—that perennial horror. Its more likely, he says, to be a chill; but cant tell for a fortnight. So we go away with that hanging over us—And once more my only refuge is work. So I wont expatiate. The great cat is playing with us once more.

How much do I mind death? I wondered last night, when I did not go to Helen’s painters party, & concluded that there is a sense in which the end could be accepted calmly. Thats odd, considering that few people are more immensely interested by life: & happy. Its Julian’s death that makes one sceptical of life I suppose. Not that I ever think of him as dead: which is queer. Rather as if he were jerked abruptly out of sight, without rhyme or reason: so violent & absurd that one cant fit his death into any scheme. But here we are, on a fine cold day, going to mate Sally at Ickenham: a saner proceeding than to analyse here. In fact I’m still spinning over 3 Gs. Finished the 2nd today for typing.

Helen’s party, Mabel said, viewing it from the pantry where she washed up till 2.30 am, was crowded noisy drunk. Several young people fell down tipsy. The fumes of punch made her head ache. This is a jaundiced pantry view; but so would mine have been I daresay had I gone. And I’ve promised to guarantee £25 for 2 years. Why? Helen’s rather exacerbating partisanship, when she dined with Joe here & was the old cantankerous Helen of Bernard St. made me ask this question."
1938.01.09,"Yes, I will force myself to begin this cursed year. For one thing I have ‘finished’ the last chapter of Three Guineas, & for the first time since I dont know when have stopped writing in the middle of the morning.

How am I to describe ‘anxiety’? I’ve battened it down under this incessant writing, thinking, about 3 Gs—as I did in the summer after Julian’s death. Rau has just been, & says there is still a trace of blood: if this continues, L. will have to go next week to a nursing home & be examined. Probably it is the prostate. This may mean an operation. We shall know nothing till Tuesday. What use is there in analysing the feelings of the past 3 weèks? He was suddenly worse at Rodmell; we came up on Wednesday:—the 28th or thereabouts [29 December]; since when its been a perpetual strain of waiting for the telephone to ring. What does the analysis show &c? He went to the hospital to be X rayed; has been, is still, in bed. There is a sense in which feelings become habitual, dulled; but only laid under a very thin cover. I walk; work, & so on. Nessa & Angelica & Duncan all at Cassis, which shuts off that relief, but why should she have this forced on her? Anyhow, they come back in a fortnight I suppose.

Harry Stephen, Judith, I think our only visitors. A dead season. No one rings up. Fine today. And the result of writing this page is to make me see how essential it is to steep myself in work; so back to 3 Guineas again. Then the time passes. Writing this it flags."
1938.01.11,"Rung up last night: Specimen completely normal.

So the claws relax for the moment.

Ideas: An Ode to Whitaker.

Specimen lecture in USA: both in rhymed prose."
1938.01.15,"In the 5 minutes left me before starting for MH. I cant describe the relief of hearing at 8 on Wednesday: Specimen perfectly normal. You can go away—Thats where we are at this moment of a wet & windy January. Definitions, explanations can wait. And I’ve just taken the last pages of the last guinea to Chancery Lane [to be typed], so deserve one days pause."
1938.02.01,"Nor can I begin analysing now. Still fairly relieved: shall be more so when the 4 weeks test is over next week. But influenza since last Monday has downed me. And 3 Gs. A week at MH. hard at work. Nessa & Angelica back—dinner at Charleston. Wet, but open fields at last. So home: then temperatures; bed; complete submersal, on the sofa &c. Now down for final corrections. 3 Gs. to be shown up to L. tonight. And I feel quite confident once in a way, & only frustrated because it cant now come out till mid May, & I must remain dumb under the shadow of The Years & Miss Storm Jameson’s bitter disappointment till then. Never mind. I can make it more compact & the notes shorter & sharper in the time added. This is only a run of my pen—the usual treat. Now for sofa."
1938.02.03,"Tomorrow is Julian’s birthday: his 30th I suppose. And I’ve been reading what Charles has to say of him. Nobleness his sign mark: & naturalness. Thats true too. A complete lack of self-consciousness; a directness won for him by our flounderings; & yet when he had gained the open world he had to make his choice. Had to be killed in Spain—an odd comment upon his education & our teaching. I dont think Charles, who has many very precise bees in his bonnet, quite sees to the bottom of the crisis, but then my vision—how Julian wanted a profession—his innate desire for self assertion, to be a figure, perhaps thats tinged by some obfuscation of my own.

Judith brought a Leslie Humphries to tea the other day—I still in my dressing gown after my first walk. A very nice couple. They’re free too; but more balance to them, I rather think. Anyhow I spurted my ideas for a new society at Newnham to Judith; who at once enlarged them to consist of dinners in private rooms with a subject for discussion—say Hazlitt, for whom she has a passion. This is putting flesh & blood on the ideas in 3 Gs. a work wh. L. is now reading.

One always has to allow for the extreme diminution of force: the effect on a second person is so much slighter than one expected. My satire seems to him mild. But the final verdict has not yet been given. I have now to do the notes. A love letter from Philip: the Press business practically through: John our partner: his first interview with Miss Lange yesterday: the Cecils today; Nessa afterwards; Monks House; still fine day."
1938.02.04,"A ten minutes spin here. L. gravely approves 3 Gs. Thinks it an extremely clear analysis. On the whole I’m content. One cant expect emotion, for as he says, its not on a par with the novels. Yet I think it may have more practical value. But I’m much more indifferent, thats true: feel it a good piece of donkeywork, & dont think it affects me either way as the novels do.

David Cecil to tea—a thin slip of a man: like the stalk of a bluebell. Said he begins, at 36, to feel stale. Therefore accepts Clark lectureship, on Hardy, & would like a Provostry at Wadham. A dried analytic mind. Not much room or verge in him. No juice: interesting as a type; & until Nessa & Leonard came in & were judicial—she very set & almost stern—I enjoyed my intimacy. Again, what is Desmond, why is he, whom all our swains adore, so melancholic & superficial? The façade. Could he have broken it, would he have written better? Old questions. Now to Rodmell"
1938.02.07,"(Mother’s birthday) where we had by the way a perfect week end, still, brisk spring: crocuses in the garden; birds rapturous; Q. to dine; Hubbard to ask L. advice about divorce. That dour gra⁠[s]⁠ping Dedman daughter has made his life Hell for 14 years; & now he finds romance in Doris Thompsett. Oh the lives of the poor! But (save for a twinge at the imminence of the sample, & thinking of Nessa) I was very happy: relieved of my book; & tossing ideas as I walked over the downs. For instance: an illustrated sheet to be called The Outsider: a barrel organ tune about The Shrivelled Thorn Furze tree on the downs, through which I see the bungalows: rhymed burlesque. A good idea. But I must do the notes to 3 Gs first.

Nessa, D. & A. dining here."
1938.03.10,"Relieved of my book? What nonsense. Here am I working 5 hours a day to finish off those notes, those proofs, & severely warned by L. today that unless I send off both in 6 days from this very Thursday, we must postpone till the autumn. But I’ve done my due today; & have said nothing here for so long: nothing about the Press; how 10 days ago I signed my rights away to John; how the last week has been June weather; & then all the people: & yesterday I went to Bunhill Fields Burial Ground; & we met Nessa & D. & A. at the 3 Sisters: & Hugh [Walpole] & Saint Denis. I dont think I can add at this moment; & shall owl round the corner to buy a surreptitious packet of cigarettes.

The new Radio came yesterday. We dine alone & shall try it. Bobo came to tea: a yellow pariah dog, still amorous, flinching from the name of Clive.

Reading scraps only; shall I ever force myself to this hard task again—& again? Yet no sooner is one idea fledged, than another cackles. Morgan told me he wrote 11 letters daily. And I none. Maynard & Lydia in residence. Two steps up into the great new room. M. recumbent, but with a stock of ideas. Bentham the origin of evil. Lydia like a peasant woman, wringing her hands, on a stool. Oh why was I born in this age? It is a terrible age. This refers to the Russian spy trials, which reflect the middle ages. A veil of insanity everywhere: & whats to be done, save keep pegging round one’s little plot?"
1938.03.12,"Hitler has invaded Austria: that is at 10 last night his army crossed the frontier, unresisted. The Austrian national anthem was heard on the wireless for the last time. We got a snatch of dance music from Vienna. This fact, which combines with the Russian trials, like drops of dirty water mixing, puts its thorn into my morning: a pernickety one spent over notes. The strength of the ray emitted from Vienna can therefore be judged. Privately I’m, as usual at the proof stage, bored with the book which was like a spine to me all last summer; upheld me in the horror of last August; & whirled me like a top miles upon miles over the downs. How can it all have petered out into diluted drivel? But it remains, morally, a spine: the thing I wished to say, though futile. Three USA papers have rejected it; but the Atlantic will pay £120 for 12,000 words. Their cable came when Morgan was here—blown in like thistledown—a very round & voluminous down he is now: but with a breeze behind him: he likes, I think, & very naturally, the praise which now comes from the young. And do I grudge it that he should be the best living novelist? He handed me a cutting, about Rose’s book, in which he is thus saluted. And so, jealous as I am, rather mean always about contemporaries, I got my dejection, to run into the dirty drop. He had been staying with Charles Trevelyan, & had his novelists bag full of small odds & ends there collected: Charles a good sort; dislikes his daughters pets; theyre sick on the carpet; Lady T.’s tapestry; the face & shield of the ancestral knight hollow; Macaulay’s books: all noted with a view to the whole, much as I do. Then Rose as usual rang up. Do you like my book? Havent yet read it. Well I do wonder what people will make of it &c. Privately I know they dont take much stock of it. But this reminds me that our last Leonard & Virginia season is perhaps our most brilliant: all the weeklies I think single out Isherwood, Upward, & even Libby Benedict for the highest places. Yes: if there is success in this world, the Hogarth Press has I suppose won what success it could. And money this year will fairly snow us under. £4,000 about from The Years: then Pépita &c &c. In fact we have asked Mr Wicks [Lewes builder] to estimate for a library at MH. in spite of Hitler. But its all a little—my earnings—in the air. To solidify them I bought 2 pairs of American shoes, with rubber soles, yesterday: item: a paper holder, now holding my great notebooks: item: a chair. & negotiated the exchange of my embroidered table—The delight of money; buying freely. Yet, puritanically, I spend next to nothing on dress. Mabel’s lugubrious sister copies very cheaply. The delight of spending is to say I want this & buy it outright, especially small articles of furniture & stationary. Perhaps in a fortnight I shall start Roger."
1938.03.22,"The public world very notably invaded the private at MH. last week end. Almost war: almost expected to hear it announced. And England, as they say, humiliated. And the man in uniform exalted. Suicides. Refugees turned back from Newhaven. Aeroplanes droning over the house. L. up to his eyes in the usual hectic negotiations. The Labour Party hemming & hawing. And I looked at Quentin & thought Theyll take you. And then, just as in private crises, a sudden lull. The tension relaxes, whether really or only because no one can keep it up; again the Torso case, the private English disputes come to the surface. And it was like June—& so remains—bland sunny blue; with the thought of Julian dead, somehow not pointless; but I keep thinking why is he not here to see the daffodils; the old beggar woman—the swans;—a useless thought: but one that comes so near the surface at Charleston, as if we were all thinking, & might see him.

I am drowsing away my last 20 minutes, having once more tried to recast the last page. Now I must ward off the old depression: the book finished, whats the use of it, feeling. So yesterday I went to Wapping Old Stairs, & roamed through Shadwell & Whitechapel; a change, as complete as France or Italy. Then Tom to dinner, & to Stephen’s Judge. A moving play: genuine; simple; sincere; the mother like Nessa. Too much poetic eloquence. But I was given the release of poetry: the end, where they murmur Peace freedom an artist’s, not an egoist’s end. He gave me a copy, & wants me to write an opinion. I like him always: his large sensitive sincerity better than the contorted nerve drawn brilliancy of the others … And a certain richness; but only about 50 people there. And I’m too eye dazzled to write more.

Miss Hepworth’s friend the bookseller finds the proofs of 3 Gs exciting."
1938.03.26,"On Monday the galleys will go. So I can then seriously turn my mind off onto Frys, Highgate, the past. And this is a fact. And would have been accomplished yesterday were it not that Pippa comes to dinner, to lay more facts before us; & Hugh Jones afterwards: hence jaded yesterday; wind & rain & cold; so to Kew, perversely, with Ann, who stayed till 8. A fine figure, athletic, hardheaded; emotional too I guess, living at Brunswick Sqre with Richard. On Monday they go to Corsica for a family jaunt together. Influenza has attacked Flossie & Clive. Dinners supplied to 8 F. Street. How dull I’m grown: what they call objective: it needs a good brain to be objective. The crisis still shakes our telephone, the voice of Kingsley appealing to L. to have his mind made. The crisis has once more set it violently in motion. But the lull is hushing us; not very profoundly though. When the tiger, ie Hitler, has digested his dinner he will pounce again. And privately, I have no letters. I must take up life again on Monday: by which I mean ask E. Bowen to tea, buy a new dress off Murray, arrange one or two parties, & not let myself be submerged in Roger quite so completely as in 3 Gs. But that submersal was a remedy; an anodyne. How could I have toiled along these last months without? As usual I have drawn too many words from my well, & want to fill it from some good book. Mandeville The Bees, I think. No sooner do I say this than I am pelted with MSS. Vast meritorious novels, that one cant skimp. My insatiable appetite for reading will glut itself on Roger. Then what? Oh my Outsider papers: The TLS is now a paper like another, not my paper. And some attempts at brief scenes. And the Odyssey. And a few days doing nothing between tea & dinner: the unconscious is asking for a rise."
1938.03.31,"But I have too much drudgery donkey work, now correcting proofs of notes, to write, or to invite: Rose & Jeremy Hutchinson dining tonight. And the nibs are wrong. And I detest my own now paralytic hand. Two pages of Roger written: then that cup dashed down by proofs. Then there’ll be page proofs. Walking in the City the great relief. Leather Lane & Neville’s Court—both new ground—& the Cut with its stale fish—yesterday. Then Ethel Smyth. Then K. Martin with his eternal article after dinner. Then MH & LP tomorrow. So its not yet possible to dive into darkness. And I’ve just bought E. FitzGerald on Sevigne, & may broach her. Very hot again. No letters again. Colefax snubbed short. L. writing his play—the one he’s brewed these 10 years & more. This is his only free week. Then accounts. John still abroad. He was in Vienna for the Hitler coup. Sheilah Grant Duff to come tonight. Oh & Judith & Ann about the place, with Richard, & a minute figure called Shawn."
1938.04.12,"Anyhow, on April 1st I think, I started Roger; & with the help of his memoirs have covered the time till Clifton. Much of it donkey work; & I suppose to be re-written. Still there is 20 pages put down, after being so long put off. And it is an immense solace to have this sober drudgery to take to instantly & so tide over the horrid anti climax of 3 Gs. I didnt get so much praise from L. as I hoped. He had to swallow the notes at a gulp though. And I suspect I shall find the page proofs (due tomorrow) a chill bath of disillusionment. But I wanted—how violently—how persistently, pressingly compulsorily I cant say—to write this book; & have a quiet composed feeling; as if I had said my say: take it or leave it; I’m quit of that; free for fresh adventures—at the age of 56. Last night I began making up again: Summers night: a complete whole: that’s my idea. E. Bowen to tea; cut out of coloured cardboard but sterling & sharpedged; Lennox Robinson (bright blue tweeds) called: we have John on us now—John saddened & hammered by his experiences at Vienna. K⁠[ingsley] M⁠[artin]. still rings up, at inordinate length: I’ve time to change & write a letter while they talk; its about emigrating now from our doomed Europe. “If it weren’t that I feel I must stay by the paper”—Also W. Robson is back; gave me the vertebrae of a cow, with his usual kind simplicity, made into a brooch; Easter is on us: Bells at Charleston; hard blue dry weather with a cold wind. Margery F. dines tomorrow; Roger surrounds me; & then to MH on Thursday, & that infernal bundle of proofs.

Am I right though in thinking that it has some importance—3 Gs—as a point of view: shows industry; fertility; & is, here & there as “well written” (considering the technical problems—quotations arguments &c) as any of my rather skimble skamble works? I think there’s more to it than to A Room: which, on rereading, seems to me a little egotistic, flaunting, sketchy: but has its brilliance—its speed. I’m suspicious of the vulgarity of the notes: of a certain insistence."
1938.04.13,"But the proofs have not come; & thus I have had a mitigated respite, which has been spent (am) reading R.’s letters; trying to decide what to leave out in the School fragment; & collecting the Clifton dossier. Now I shall not be so literal; but what am I to be? And I a little resent so much fact seeking. Also resent being told by some French scribbler [not identified] that I cant externalise; so to contradict him wish to be intelligent—so wd like to read 3 Gs & see if I am intelligent—& so on. A very fine clear day. A spring without any paralell. so enduring: so constantly unexpected this sun. All the trees are now full out. And no checks. The hyacinths over. So in MH we shall get the full blast. Summer time last Sunday. And today (oh these pens—I’m always throwing them away & hoping for a better one) … we may go into society; to a party at Susan Lawrence’s. Why? God knows, having rejected so many others. Probably our Press takings this year will beat all others: £2,500?"
1938.04.26,"We had our Easter at MH; but as for the sun, it never shone; was colder than Christmas; a grudging lead-coloured sky; razor wind; winter clothes; proofs; much acute despair; curbed however, by the aid of divine philosophy; a joy in discovering Mandeville’s Bees (this really a fruitful book; the very book I want) then Q. rings up; to warn you: Have you had a letter from Pipsy? Ottoline is dead. They told her P. might die, & the shock killed her; & hes asking you to write about her. (with Mr Wicks & Mr Muzzell [builders] exploring the attics for the new room). So I had to write; the horrid little pellet screwed my brain; leaves it giddy. Yet in spite of that here am I sketching out a new book; only dont please impose that huge burden on me again, I implore. Let it be random & tentative; something I can blow of a morning, to relieve myself of Roger: dont, I implore, lay down a scheme; call in all the cosmic immensities; & force my tired & diffident brain to embrace another whole—all parts contributing—not yet awhile. But to amuse myself, let me note: why not Poyntzet Hall: a centre: all lit. discussed in connection with real little incongruous living humour; & anything that comes into my head; but “I” rejected: ‘We’ substituted: to whom at the end there shall be an invocation? “We” … composed of many different things … we all life, all art, all waifs & strays—a rambling capricious but somehow unified whole—the present state of my mind? And English country; & a scenic old house—& a terrace where nursemaids walk? & people passing—& a perpetual variety & change from intensity to prose. & facts—& notes; &—but eno’. I must read Roger: & go to Ott’s memorial service, representing also T. S. Eliot at his absurd command. 2.30 at Martins in the Fields."
1938.04.27,"Ottoline’s burial service. Oh dear, oh dear the lack of intensity; the wailing & mumbling, the fumbling with bags; the shuffling; the vast brown mass of respectable old South Kensington ladies. And then the hymns; & the clergyman with a bar of medals across his surplice; & the orange & blue windows; & a toy Union Jack sticking from a cranny. What all this had to do with Ottoline, or our feelings? Save that the address was to the point: a critical study, written presumably by Philip & delivered, very resonantly, by Mr Speiaght the actor: a sober, & secular speech, which made one at least think of a human being, though the reference to her beautiful voice caused one to think of that queer nasal moan: however that too was to the good in deflating immensities. P.’s secretary buttonholed me, & told me to sit high up. The pew was blocked by a vast furred lady who said “I’m afraid I cant move”—as indeed seemed the fact. So, I stationed myself rather behind; near eno’ though to see the very well set up back of P. in his thick coat; & his red Rams head turned now & then looking along the ranks: also I pressed his hand, simulated I fear, more emotion than I felt when he asked me, had I liked the address? & so slowly moved out on to the steps—past Jack & Mary, Sturge Moores, Molly, &c: Gertler having tears in his eyes; various household staffs; was then pounced on & pinioned by Lady Oxford: who was hard as whipcord; upright; a little vacant in the eye, in spite of make up which made it shine. She said she had expostulated with Ott. about the voice. Mere affectation. But a wonderful woman. Tell me, though, why did her friends quarrel with her? Pause—She was exigeante, Duncan volunteered at last. And so Margot refused to ask further; & modulated into stories of Symonds & Jowett, when I bantered her on her obituary. Mine, of Ott. for the Times, has not appeared nor do I much regret. So to Nessa’s where we recounted the story; & yet I’m left fumbling for a house I shant go to. Odd how the sense of loss takes this quite private form: someone who wont read what I write. No illumination in Gower Street, an intimacy checked abolished.
"
1938.04.28,"Walked in Dulwich yesterday & lost my brooch by way of a freshener when confronted with the final proofs just today (April 28th) done; & to be sent this afternoon: a book I shall never look at again. But I now feel entirely free. Why? Have committed myself, am afraid of nothing. Can do anything I like. No longer famous, no longer on a pedestal; no longer hawked in by societies: on my own, for ever. Thats my feeling: a sense of expansion, like putting on slippers. Why this shd. be so, why I feel myself enfranchised till death, & quit of all humbug, when I daresay its not a good book, & will excite nothing but mild sneers; & how very inconsequent & egotistical V.W. is—why why I cant analyse: being fluttered this morning. Lady Simon this afternoon—Well I’ve done my bit for that cause, & cant be bullied. And then, when they badger me, I can say Refer to 3 Gs.

Rain & dark. A lost dog in the Square; political lull. Income Tax up to 5/6. Our earnings prodigious. Income last year about £6,000. John much impressed. Press worth £10,000. & all this sprung from that type on the drawing room table at Hogarth House 20 years ago. I can now give all my mind to Roger; also blow a few private bubbles of a morning; & dont wait publication day with any expectations. I shall I feel forget this book completely. Yet I never wrote a book with greater fervour; under such a lash of compulsion. And it stood me in good stead. Now America wants Common Reader articles. (Penguin republishes in the autumn) will pay £50: & I think of Walt Whitman: Walpole’s Letters; & White’s Selborne. 3 Gs. has won me the right to go back to that world: no doubt a more ‘real’ world: but debarred by brambles for 4 years."
1938.04.29,"The difficulty is that I get so absorbed in this fantastic Pointz Hall I cant attend to Roger. So what am I to do? This however is only my first day of freedom; & I have been rendered self-conscious by a notice of T⁠[hree]. G⁠[uineas]. on the front page of the new bloated TLS. Well it cant be helped; & I must cling to my ‘freedom’—that mysterious hand that was reached out to me about 4 years ago.

Meanwhile, Lady Simon came to tea, & of course looks forward to my castigation at their expense—for so I suspect it will be; a very nice salt of the earth dowdy but decisive woman, with whom I’m on impersonal good terms. Yet she alluded yesterday to my daughter, the most gifted of my children who died. And off she went in chocolate brown fur & puce to investigate elementary schools in Suffolk.

A fine day for once. Dog loose in square. L. & I have our week’s treat this afternoon. I’m in a dazed state, hovering between 2 worlds like a spiders web with nothing to attach the string to. Why not write about Scott’s diaries, so bring in the immortal novels? My Times obit, on Ott. printed in early editions, omitted by mistake, they say, from the later. A thousand from H⁠[arcourt]. B⁠[race].: the last fruit I suppose from The Years. This makes about 3,000 from them. Can I therefore buy a chair? & 2 dresses? Oh how odd to see the blue sky at the top of the skylight again!"
1938.05.03,"Pouring now; the drought broken; the worst spring on record; my pens diseased, even the new box; my eyes ache with Roger, & I’m a little appalled at the prospect of the grind this book will be. I must somehow shorten & loosen; I cant (remember) stretch out a long painstaking literal book: later I must generalise & let fly. But then, what about all the letters? How can one cut loose from facts, when there they are, contradicting my theories? A problem. But I’m convinced I cant physically, strain after an RA portrait.

What was I going to say with this defective nib? Heres L. to ask me what I think Libby Benedict looks like? I guess fat & Jewish: she’s thin & Jewish. I think I suspect our first breach with John. It’ll be over his fashion complex. HP must be in the movement. Wants to reject the Kabbalah (a powerful Arnold Bennett novel) because its old fashioned. And what line am I to take about a story for New Writing: when I dont mean to be a signpost to that gang of elderly novelties? These are our problems. Mrs Nicholls also a problem. A flashy underworld flibbertigibbet on the surface; daughter of a Hastings Dr: has a child: the child has tonsils. Mrs N. very “naive”: has kept underworld company. Lange has waddled off; gooselike; into what line of life we dont know. I have very few letters. And we take our treat on Friday now, & went to St Albans, in the grey blizzard; & saw Roman pavements, guarded by men in overcoats, attending upon imbecile sons. Had tea, & heard the local ladies discussing the Empire Day celebrations, which are to include a red white & blue cake decorated with flags. What will they say to 3 Gs? But I’m philosophic, fundamentally; & feel, as I’ve said, oddly quit of it all. A Row in the papers about Wyndham Lewis’s rejected portrait of Tom: & Tom has to be represented at Ott’s funeral. Clive at Charleston. Sunday evening alone with Nessa: oh dear—That signifies my desperation: Julian not there, I mean. The wound bleeding; & nothing to be said. So I will buy a chair this wet day, in order to keep moving."
1938.05.09,"This is written to fill up the usual distracted relics of Mondays broken morning: drove up [from Rodmell] in the clear May morning light: sun out wonderously; laburnum all chipped by the bitter spring: but pink on the may, & various fine shades of gold red & bluebell blue on the trees all the same. Found here that Richard cant dine & go to A.’s play this evening (she had a triumph, dancing, Nessa says [;] is mentioned in the Times): also Miss Phyllis Bentley’s lecture on me; shall I tell her anything true about The Years for example? Then Tom in Portugal; then Mary Hutch, whom I met in a shoe shop; then Morgan asking some literary help about a quotation in a pageant. Then I ring up Sally & mercifully secure her for tonight: find Mabel has moved the drawing room chair here—oh what comfort I now sit in after 10 years moderate discomfort; but her chair, her long promised chair, has stuck. A rather patchy week end: bitter cold, Q. didnt come; I had no good nonsense book; & giddy in the head; cant settle either to my Play (Pointz Hall is to become in the end a play) or to Roger’s Cambridge letters. The truth is we want a holiday; & have to dribble along rather jaded, trying odds & ends to keep moving, until June 8th or so, when we escape. However on Sunday, we walked, rather slowly to save my head, from Tarring Neville toward Bishopstone, along the long Down road made by primeval carts; & half the down was blue purple with some grass: & then the gorse blazing silky, nutty, hares racing; home to bowls & the silly clever imitation & oh how she makes me detest my own writing—May Sarton’s book this refers to, ungrammatically. A social week ahead: Bella back; lunch Clive; to Philip [Morrell] to choose a ring & emotionalise; 2 plays of A⁠[ngelica’]⁠s & God damn it, Saturday at Ray’s. L. rather on edge about that. Now lunch."
1938.05.12,"Lunch Clive (balderdash, respectability rampant; hard superficiality) to Philip’s after tea. Shook hands with Grey Millie. Two interesting things: that Ott. confided everything in M. whom she had had all M.’s life: the other the vast importance she attached to her Memoirs. To be saved in a fire before anything. They were her justification; the proof to herself I suppose & the world that Ott was not what they thought. Sat in the upper room with P. kindly, I wary. Simple. Some little reserve; touched hands over the ring. He pressed things on me. I felt rather uncomfortable: a vulture feeling; didnt want to take so much. But took the big green ring & pearl earrings, shawl & fan. A kind of ripple of laughter at myself “doing well out of Ottoline”. But thats not the whole. P. has been left out of it all as he said. O. when dying last summer, suddenly named Hacket, a vulgar Irish peasant, P. says, joint lit. executor with Bob. G. Hardy & Hope. I advised P. to write a solid memoir at once. He will, but am I to add a chapter? We had out the great box with all the orange bound books she used to keep on a stool—all full. Whats to be done? And then the great bedspread? Julian [daughter] despises the old curiosity shop side of O. Wont look at these things. O. not a good mother—didn’t want children. P. rather battered—simple, cheerful, with a vast black satin cravat. Had a bad heart, from an old rowing strain. The specialist thinking Ott. an ordinary wife said “Do you want the truth?” Yes. “Well any shock will kill you. How old? 67. You wont see 68—except you live like a potato.” She burst into tears, which she seldom did. Then he recovered, she got ill—paralysed—some nerve affection. They then told her of the Drs. death: she was sick all night; recovered; & suddenly died in the early morning. She had written though a letter of farewell to the duke as if expecting this. Drawing room littered & unkempt. A lovely thrush egg blue evening; domes & chimneys very pure & sharp walking home with my green shagreen box the shawl & the fan. O.’s last gifts."
1938.05.20,"Time & again I have meant to write down my expectations, dreads, & so on, waiting the publication on—I think June 2nd—of 3 Gs—but haven’t, because what with living in the solid world of Roger, & then (again this morning) in the airy world of Poyntz Hall I feel extremely little. And dont want to rouse feeling. What I’m afraid of is the taunt Charm & emptiness. The book I wrote with such violent feelings to relieve that immense pressure will not dimple the surface. That is my fear. Also I’m uneasy at taking this role in the public eye—afraid of autobiography in public. But the fears are entirely outbalanced (this is honest) by the immense relief & peace I have gained, & enjoy this moment. Now I am quit of that poison & excitement. Nor is that all. For having spat it out, my mind is made up. I need never recur or repeat. I am an outsider. I can take my way: experiment with my own imagination in my own way. The pack may howl, but it shall never catch me. And even if the pack—reviewers, friends, enemies—pays me no attention or sneers, still I’m free. This is the actual result of that spiritual conversion (I cant bother to get the right words) in the autumn of 1933—or 4—when I rushed through London, buying, I remember, a great magnifying glass, from sheer ecstasy, near Blackfriars: when I gave the man who played the harp half a crown for talking to me about his life in the Tube station. The omens are mixed: L. is less excited than I hoped; Nessa highly ambiguous; Miss Hepworth & Mrs Nicholls say “Women owe a great deal to Mrs Woolf” & I have promised Pippa to supply books. Now for R.’s letters & Monks H—at the moment windy & cold."
1938.05.24,"I’m pleased this morning because Lady Rhondda writes that she is “profoundly excited & moved by 3 Gs.” Theo Bosanquet who has a review copy read her extracts. And she thinks it may have a great effect, & signs herself my grateful Outsider. A good omen; because this shows that certain people will be stirred; will think; will discuss: it wont altogether be frittered away. Of course Ly R. is already partly on my side; but again as she’s highly patriotic & citizenlike she might have been roused to object. Its on the cards that it will make more splash among the ink pots than I thought—feeling very dim & cold these last weeks, & indifferent too: & oblivious of the great excitement & intensity with which (certainly) I wrote.

But as the whole of Europe may be in flames—its on the cards. One more shot at a policeman, & the Germans, Czecks, French will begin the old horror. The 4th of August [1914] may come next week. At the moment there is a lull. L. says K. Martin says we say (the P.M.) that we will fight this time. Hitler therefore is chewing his little bristling moustache. But the whole thing trembles: & my book may be like a moth dancing over a bonfire—consumed in less than one second. Morgan rang up yesterday about Rosamond’s great meeting for writers to protest against Spain, for wh. she has hired the Queens Hall. But hasnt asked us. What is he to do? Thinks it foolish. So I let fly a few, guarded hints as to my own attitude. We must attack Hitler in England. “Thats what I’m always saying” he said “But how?” “Oh I’m in touch with Pippa & Newnham…” He seemed to sympathise. Anyhow he wont speak at QH. or send a message. Now for the [Chelsea] Flower Show; dinner at the Hutch. What am I to wear?

Aeroplanes growling overhead in the cloudy blue sky. They look like sharks, seen through our wavy window. No rain. No fruit. Vegs. dried up."
1938.05.25,"Too tired after a dreary dinner at the Hutchinsons to write: so let me scribble. Ka is dead. I read it by chance in the [News] Chronicle yesterday before going to the flower show. No flowers, no mourning. Why did she die? And what do I feel? Oh that one could feel more for the deaths of ones friends! But it comes & goes, feeling. Always at first visual—Ka lying drawn & white, there with the flat sea underneath—the ships passing. And Will pretending, poor little dried squeezed man—all her thought would be for him. Her passion for the boy—that she had left him, unknowing what he was to become, unable to go on educating protecting planning for Mark. I remember going there one spring morning when he was asleep in the perambulator at the door. And she came hurrying out agitated lest we should wake him. Her own identical life ended when Rupert died. So I think. After that she was acting a part very carefully & deliberately chosen. Maternity, Will, public life. Hence some squint; she was never natural, never with me at least. And I was self-conscious; remembering how she had seen me mad. She used to come to Asheham, to Holford: condescending, patronising, giving up her own pleasures to tend me & help L. I dont think I was ever at my ease with her. Yet we had an old affection; remembered things—Rupert &c—that we never spoke of. She had that irritating Quack Quack in her voice; as if she always must be impressing me with her busyness, her social standing even among the county families; her responsibilities: how she was a JP on some Education Co⁠[mmi]⁠ttee; doing actual things with important real people, while we frittered our time away writing books in London. She protested too much—a sign of dissatisfaction I suppose—with Will? She had to transform him into something noble, unconventional, brilliant, good; from the material which was none of those things really. But she liked Cornwall; so did I. She liked the view that day she took us to—the promontory all silver & blue—the lovely moor—the badger & the foxes barking round the house, & the long drives over Zennor Moor; seeing the gipsy woman in her tent; I daresay alone she was happier than she ever got said. In her house—a singularly ugly house in some ways—with a kind of formality & no luxuriance—she was too much the hostess who keeps open house. But at the same time that was her role: to help; to lift lame dogs; to entertain; to arrange; manage; receive confidences. And what was wrong with all that? Only that after Rupert’s death she was playing a part. Yet this is superficial. For there was a trustiness in her; a stable goodness; a tenderness under the assumption—Children, she wd. say & irritated me—& a good deal of fortitude, patience; a determination to oar her way—Bruin I called her, at the Vienna Café one day with Rupert—Bruin oaring her way—with a beavers tail, & short clumsy paws. He liked the image. It conveyed her thickness, breadth. She was very broad cheeked; & her face was long drawn out. In spite of her clumsiness & sturdiness she was very pale. She had thinned & wrinkled last time we stayed there. She wore 2 or 3 good Rings—cameos with heads on them. She chose bright pure colours for her clothes; wore a coloured handkerchief round her hair; often stuck it with a silver pin: an individual looking woman; derived partly from a John painting; but also practically equipped for her car driving, committees; her endless meetings in St Ives & Truro; she took her place very capably on the Bench: had a great shrewdness & capacity & some humour, only suppressed by Will’s acidity. Now I come to think of it, she had managed her life with great (composure) individuality. There was her cottage at Aldbourne; her ability to make excursions, take charge of situations, oar her way courageously where she wished. I wonder, did she know she was dying? & what did she think of it all? And why? As usual, I regret: that she sent me cream at Christmas, & in the flurry of L.’s illness I never wrote & thanked; that she suggested coming, & absorbed in Nessa last autumn, I did not arrange it. But this is always so; & can’t be helped. And I am thinking of her with affection—old Ka. The deep silence between us was threaded with something that could vibrate, & does: chiefly through the eye at this moment. I can imagine a half smiling So goodbye Children & dont bother. Old Ka’s all right … But Mark?"
1938.05.26,"Ka had a seizure & died without regaining consciousness. This is from a typed form sent by Chris A.F. [her brother-in-law] this morning. She is buried today—rainy & dark: & I shall not go to the service. Will is in Canada.

My usual 5 minutes for notes. The PH mood used up. Roger at Cambridge difficult to recover. 3 weeks before Scotland, & rather anxious (though its true I’m more indifferent than ever before) during these 3 coming out weeks. Mercifully we shall be away mostly. And I think to fill in the time quietly by forcing myself to do a Horace Walpole sketch for America. Why not? It means close reading; alien matter; & just time to do it. I cant broach another R. chapter—too tired of facts."
1938.05.27,"Its odd to be working at half cock after all those months of high pressure. The result is half an hour every day to write here. Roger I’m retyping; & shall then sketch Walpole. I have just been signing in bright green ink those circulars. But I will not expatiate on the dreariness of doing things one ought to do. A letter, grateful, from Bruce Richmond, ending my 30 year connection with him & the Lit Sup. How pleased I used to be when L. called me “You’re wanted by the Major Journal!” & I ran down to the telephone to take my almost weekly orders at Hogarth House! I learnt a lot of my craft writing for him: how to compress; how to enliven; & also was made to read with a pen & notebook, seriously. I am now waiting for today week—when thats over, my swell will subside. And cant I prophesy? On the whole I shall get more pain than pleasure; I shall mind the sneers more than I shall enjoy Ly Rhondda’s enthusiasm. There’ll be many sneers—some very angry letters. Some silences. And then—3 weeks yesterday—we shall be off. And by July 7th when we come back—or sooner, for we dread too many hotels—it will be over, almost entirely; & then for 2 years I think I shall publish nothing, save American articles. And this week of waiting is the worst, & its not very bad—nothing in the least comparable to the horror of The Years: (that deadened into indifference so sure was I of failure). As for sales, I am not very hopeful; 6 thousand I daresay; the shops are tepid.

Today I’m had in a corner by a persistent Miss Neilsen, my evening ruined. L. went to his Jury this morning, only to be told “You will be pleased to hear that you’re discharged.” So thats over."
1938.05.28,"A pouring wet day as dark as November. May—this spring has been blotted from the calendar. Heres my daily canter: which will take the form I suppose of a temperature Chart. The Buzz is beginning, though the little gadfly only emerges from its shell next Thursday. Mrs Lynd in Harper’s Bazaar sneers, says I preach sitting still on a sofa; & Miss Osier or some such name writes to thank & praise—my grand work &c &c. These first rumours always give the shape of whats to come: I can foretell that those who dislike will sneer at me for a well to do aesthete; & those who approve will echo Rhondda’s “most exciting” profoundly moving. All reviews & letters will ring changes on those notes; now I have to send a copy to Pippa, with my heart beating: after that it will beat to the time of sneer enthusiasm, enthusiasm sneer. And I rather think I shall sum it all up in 6 months in a pamphlet; & if my facts are challenged get 29 M⁠[arsham]. S⁠[treet]. to reply.

To the Caledonian market in my new pinching shoes yesterday, where I bought 6 tea spoons & some flowers. Miss Nielsen came; a daneish bee haunted American lit. prof., entirely distracted by Einstein, & his extra mundane influence upon fiction. L. threaded the maze to the muddle in the centre. I gave up on the outskirts. Rather genuine, naive, a little like Christabel; & as usual much more likeable than her letters. One cant dislike people in the flesh. But she ruined my reading of Walpole to wh. I now happily turn.

L. lunching with Robsons."
1938.05.30,"Nessa’s birthday—the 58th [59th] I think it must be. She is at Charleston, with A. & Q. now that A.’s time at Islington is done. Oh dear—Julian not there. And it rains hard—she says she is glad to be away. How could she have lived through the suspense last summer? what torture—so I thought, as I walked to Gough Square yesterday, by way of freshener before the Robson children & Tom at tea. A great spread; mostly eaten. The little boy crammed his mouth with sweets, & added one that Sally had already sucked. Tom came, most respectable; swallow tails & grey silk tie, having he explained to slip into his evening service in time to take round the plate—a churchwarden in South Kensington. Very friendly; & elaborate description of his triumphal progress through Portugal as Brit. Rep. on some prize giving commission. And then he spoke at Salisbury on George Herbert, in aid of the Cathedral, staying with the Richmonds. I was amused at the careful analysis he gave Juliette—a very sympathetic Frog—no humbug—no clothes—giving dinner to 30 people off cold food & so on—of his own plays failure, & of Priestley’s artistic nonentity, scrupulously, painfully conscientious in detail; with his wild hazel eyes.

But I meant to record the chart: Observer has a friendly forecast: says 3 Gs. is poetic; profound; in my essayists vein; so that brings in another note—poetry, beautifully written & lucidly argued. No word from Pippa. L. says I must expect some very angry reviews from men. I add, From women too. Then there’ll be the clergy. But I think I can sit calm as a toad in an oak at the centre of the storm. And am training myself to inhabit that centre⁠[;] read quietly: Walpole; Johnson; & stodge away at Roger. I possess my soul—now thats a thing one can do. I am not forcing myself to buy a new dress from Murray—a great victory for the shabby city haunting V. Its true—people cant really “get at one”."
1938.05.31,"A letter from Pippa. She is enthusiastic. So this is the last load off my mind—which weighed it rather heavy, for I felt if I had written all that & it was not to her liking I should have to brace myself pretty severely in my own private esteem. But she says its the very thing for which they have panted; & the poison is now drawn. Now I can face the music, or donkeys bray or geeses cackle by the Reviews so indifferently that (truthfully) I find myself forgetting that they’ll all be out this week end. Never have I faced review day so composedly. Also I dont much mind my Cambridge friends either. Maynard may have a gibe; but what care I? And I shant send copies to my family, & so they need say nothing. What the bemedalled Wolves, with whom we dined last night, will say I dont know, but would find probably amusing. And the old Prostitutes, Hugh, Compton Mackenzie, Guedalla, Storm Jameson &c who are meeting next week to declare their belief in Liberty—well, they’re not going to show it save on the platform, & can hardly deny me the right they preach. So I expect a good deal of fun one way & another: some teasing of venerable gents; some innuendos, some digs at the Lynds & Squires; as well as a fountain of effusion from the faithful. But its the fun I shall enjoy: Hugh’s elaborate defence of his creative zest for honours & cheques.

The dinner last night was a severe middleclass patriarchal grind: T⁠[om] & B⁠[ella] had been to Court. “He looked the type of a beautiful man” Mrs W. said—“in all his medals & cocked hat & Bella with her tiara, & no flowers—they wd. have hidden the medals”. A very long dinner, hard chairs & very forced cheery talk. But we get off easily."
1938.06.03,"Rodmell

This is the coming out day of 3 Gs. And the Lit Sup has 2 columns & a leader; & the Referee a great black Bar Woman declares sex war; or some such caption. And it makes so much less difference than any other cackle on coming out day that I’ve written quietly at Poyntz Hall; haven’t even troubled to read R. Lynd, nor look at the Ref: nor read through the Times article. Its true I have a sense of quiet & relief. But no wish to read reviews, or hear opinions. I wonder why this is? Because its a fact I want to communicate rather than a poem? I daresay something of the kind. Mercifully we have 50 miles of felt between ourselves & the din. L. has been talking to Mrs Ebbs about the school, & finally won her over by praising her new chintz covers, hideous as they are. Then I found a grass snake sunning itself in the hedge, but when L. came, it was gone. Then Mrs Curtis wired to ask us to go to Macbeth at Glyndebourne. Refused. It is sunny, warm, dry & like a June day but will rain later. Oh it pleased me that the Lit Sup says I’m the most brilliant pamphleteer in England. Also that this book may mark an epoch if taken seriously. Also that the Listener says I am scrupulously fair, & puritanically deny myself flights. But thats about all.

Anyhow thats the end of six years floundering, striving, much agony, some ecstasy: lumping the Years & 3 Gs together as one book—as indeed they are. And now I can be off again, as indeed I long to be. Oh to be private, alone, submerged.

I talked to Nessa about Julian on Wednesday. She can hardly speak. What matters compared with that? Yet I was always thinking of Julian when I wrote."
1938.06.05,"This is the mildest childbirth I have ever had. Compare it with The Years! I wake knowing the yap will begin & never bother my head. Yesterday I had T. & Tide, & various London obscurities: today Observer: Selincourt: A terrible indictment. Sunday Times, N. Statesman, & Spectator, reserved for next week presumably. So the temperature remains steady. I foretell a great many letters on Tuesday night: some anonymous & abusive. But I have already gained my point: I’m taken seriously, not dismissed as a charming prattler as I feared. The Times yesterday had a paragraph headed “Mrs Woolf’s call to women. A serious challenge that must be answered by all thinkers”—or something like that; prefacing the Lit Sup. advt: unknown before I think; & must be some serious intention behind it. A note of ecstasy from Ethel half way through.

Walked on the racecourse: bought stockings cakes in Lewes. Charleston & Bunny to tea today, yesterday the first hot summer day. People in tails & white shirts tripping about Lewes. Glyndebourne in full flower. Mrs Curtis asked us. We refused. Windy today, but still fine, & the sun still active—after I suppose 2 months drought damp & darkness. The ugliest spring on record. So we were wise to save our holiday, though I’m so rested now, & writing gaily at P.H. that I dont want very much: to look at the sea however wd. be a relief: we shall attempt Skye, for if we dont now we never shall. L. says we are old. I say we are middle aged."
1938.06.11,"Only five minutes to record the merciful fact that the N.S. is out (K. John prattling is foolish but as L. says well meaning) & now, save for the Sunday Times, the ink splash is over, & I can count it on the whole a good deal better than I expected. On the whole 3 Gs is taken seriously: many high compliments; some snarls (Spring in the E. Standard has his hackles up) but generally kind, rather surprised, & its over— Off we can go to Scotland for a holiday that I dont really need, but still a freshener before Roger wont come amiss. No book ever slid from me so secretly & smoothly. Letters begin from America, about the extract in the Atlantic. None, save Pippa Ray & an amusingly tepid one from Judith, who likes it very much but thinks the end diffuse. No thanks: no enthusiasm from the young for whom I toiled. But thats as I expected, & as it should be. Ray & Pippa are the prime relief. Nothing from Pernel, or Vita. Sales began slowly; but today & yesterday, 300 sold. I think 10,000 will go off. And its hit the crest of the wave. Tom being given his degree at Cambridge: walking in procession with the other bigwigs: Trinity feast; Tattoo; honours List—if anyone reads it, the illustration is pat to hand. Quit of all this, I’ve written an article on Walpole, very fast & free, for America. Walked several good walks. Weather much recovered, though unstable. Mrs Ebbs put the School meeting off. We go up this evening after tea. Bowls. Bells. & the garden being planted by L. with some little help from me. And I must go in to cold mutton."
1938.06.16,"Baldock. Stop to light a pipe on the Icknield Way, a scrubby street of yellow villas. Now St James Deeping. After Croyland, a magnificent moulded Church. Now very hot; flat; an old gent fishing. Spread out and exposed. River above road level. On now to Gainsborough. Lunch at Peterborough: factory chimneys. Railway gate opened; off again. Gainsborough. A red Venetian palace rising among bungalows; in a square of unkempt grass. Long windows, leaning walls. A maze of little lanes. A strange forgotten town."
1938.06.19,"at Housesteads [Northumberland], Thorn trees; sheep. The [Roman] wall and white headed boys in front. Miles and miles of lavender campagna. One thread coloured frail road crossing the vast uncultivated lonely land. Today all cloud and blue and wind. The wall is a wave with a sharp crest, as of a wave drawn up to break. Then flat. Bogs under the crest. Waiting now for the rain to stop, for it blew and rained that day on the wall. Now a few miles from Corbridge waiting in the middle of the moor. Very black. Larks singing. Lunch deferred. A party of ninety lunching at the Inn at Piercebridge [on 17 June], A sense of local life; 18th century inn diners to celebrate some sport. So on to a Manse in a garden; a very solid private house that takes in residents. Hot ham, and fruit, but real cream, looking over an ugly range. The country early today was fen Wash country. Then the Pennines. These are shrouded in a heat mist. Larks singing. L. now looking for water for Sally, (but this should precede the wall)."
1938.06.19,"Sitting by the road under the Roman wall while L. cleans sparking plugs. And I have been reading translations of Greek verse, and thinking idly. When one reads the mind is like an aeroplane propeller invisibly quick and unconscious—a state seldom achieved. Not a bad Oxford introduction, trying to be in touch, up to date; scholarly but Oxford. Cows moving to the top of the hill by some simultaneous sympathy. One draws the others. Wind rocks the car. Too windy to climb up and look at the lake. Reason why the hills are still Roman—the landscape immortal … what they saw I see. The wind, the June wind, the water, and snow. Sheep bedded in the long turf like pearls. No shade, no shelter. Romans looking over the border. Now nothing comes. Also I’m thinking with an occasional rasp of Vita’s letter—‘misleading’, could beat me down with fisticuffs. Well let her. But none of this very serious. All the wild white flowers along the grass border in violent agitation. Many buried camps. Grass still takes their shape. Why dig up? Not I think an impressive reconstruction of the past—too like the foundations of farm buildings, when they do. The outpost feeling though from the little watchtowers remains. Forts to fight from; the wall to look from. In one well a glass bottle was dug up. And the latrines and the treasure house."
1938.06.20,"Scotch border: Monday ten to eleven. Sitting in the car looking across a vast spread emerald tinted little hills rising a great flow of green land. Some bars of trees otherwise grass, uncultivated, no roads. Carter Fell behind; ripples of hills in the distance; a few single scattered trees. One red brown field; some tent shaped hills. Board has Scotland written on it—a moor road. How Scott must have come this way—near Jedburgh. Burke Sir Walter. A cold windy day with blue slabs consequent floating colours. A novelist should be able to describe two spinsters sisters opening letters at breakfast—letters with stamped addresses. “How awfully stupid—I said the 18th” (a fragment from the breakfast table at Chollerford. These old ladies caught me smoking a cigar. They played patience ferociously; but not on Sunday. Then they read solid books.)"
1938.06.21,"Now in Midlothian. Stopping for petrol. On the way to Stirling. Scotch mist driven across the trees. Normal Scots weather. Great hills. Ugly puritanical houses. The Hydro [Hotel, Melrose] built 90 years ago. A woman called and said she had seen Mrs Woolf walking in Melrose on Saturday. Second sight as I was not there. Galashiels a manufacturing town. Hideous. Fragments of talk overheard at the Hydro Melrose. Soft voiced old Scotch ladies sitting in their accredited places by the fire under the window. “I was wondering why you walked about with an umbrella.” One who is stitching, “I wonder if I should wash it and begin again. I’m working on a dirty ground.”

Here I interpose. We stopped at Dryburgh to see Scott’s grave. It is under the broken palanquin of a ruined chapel. Just enough roof to cover it. And there he lies—Sir Walter Scott Baronet, in a caddy made of chocolate blancmange with these words cut large and plain on the lid. As Dame Charlotte who is buried beside him is covered with the same chocolate slab it must have been his taste. And theres something fitting in it. For the Abbey is impressive and the river running at the bottom of the field, and all the old Scots ruins standing round him. I picked a white syringa in memory but lost it. An airy place but Scott is much pressed together. The col. by his side, and Lockhart his son in law at his feet. Then there’s Haig’s stuck about with dark red poppies.

But the old ladies are discussing Dr John Brown whose brother was a doctor in Melrose. Soon ones head would ache and ones senses fuddle. One would eat too many cakes at tea and theres a huge dinner at 7. “I think he’s very nice—her husband. She’s got a personality of her own. A very nice cir-r-cle. Where do they live? Retired to Perthshire…. I’m three stitches out … Miss Peace came along to the reading room with her friend and wanted a fire. Couldnt she have rung the bell or something? Out you come! (unpicking the knitting.) Theres so much opened up now. Two years ago was the Centenary (of Dryburgh?). I went to the meeting. There was a service—most interesting. All the Ministers. Five on the platform. Possibly the Moderator. At any rate it was very nice and it was a beautiful day and the place was very full. The birds joined in the music. Alan Haig’s birthday. There was a service at Dryburgh. I like D. I’ve not been to Jedburgh—awfully pretty.” No, I don’t think I can write it all out. The old creatures are sitting on a sofa not much older than I am I daresay. Yes, they’re about 65. “Edinburgh’s nice—I like it. We have to go away before we appreciate it. You have to go away from your birthplace. Then when you go back everything changed. A year does it—2 years do it. I should leave it (of the work) and see the effect afterwards. What church d’you go to? Church of Scotland—not to St Giles. It used to be the Troon. We go to St Giles. It was St George’s parish—my husband was an elder in St George’s parish Charlotte Square. D’you like Waugh? I like him in a way. I don’t hear him and its a common complaint. He gives very hard sermons—you cant take anything away. The choir’s beautiful. I cant get a sitting from which you can hear. I feel it infra dig rushing with the crowd. The crowd hasnt reached—I’ve just got to sit still—I’m having a service—I hear the prayers the young men the music. It was pretty well where they come in from the Thistle chapel. They passed me bang. I rose and moved along. There are some seats the people never come to, and often the best seats. I like St Giles, a lovely old place. The old lady whose seat I had told me the church was all renovated. Chambers did it, and when it came to the opening not a seat retained for the Chambers family. Badly arranged. Someone provided seats for them. A stupid thing. Always some higher church alteration. I like the episcopal. If it be episcopal let it be; if. Church of Scotland, let it be Ch. of Scotland. Dr Waugh’s brother is at Dundee. He would like Roseneath. Someone said that the minister at Roseneath is delicate.”

Wind rages trees leafless bannocks and a blue pound note the only changes. Glencoe. Menacing. Leaf green hills, islands floating, a moving string of cars; no inhabitants, only tourists…. Ben Nevis with stripes of snow. The sea. Little boats; feeling of Greece and Cornwall. Yellow flags and great foxgloves no farms villages or cottages; a dead land overrun with insects. An old man who could not get up from his chair, two other ladies, her legs overflowing her shoes; all dress for dinner, and sit in the drawing room. This was the good inn at Crianlarich [on 21 June]. Lake with hanging stalactites green trees in the middle: bowl of the hills. Hills with velvet leaf green. The Bannington of Eaton Place. She had found winter green for her father-in-law, a botanist. Sky light at 11. Bad review of Three Guineas by G. M. Young. Pain lasted ten minutes: over then. Loch Ness swallowed Mrs Hambro. She was wearing pearls.

[In handwriting:] And then, sick of copying, I tore the rest of it up—a lesson, next journey, not to make endless pencil notes that need copying. Some too I regret: some Boswell experiments in Inns. Also the woman whose grmother worked for the Wordsworths & remembered him an old man in a cloak with a red lining muttering poetry. Sometimes he wd pat the children on the head, but never spoke to them. On the other hand, H. Coleridge was always drinking at the pub with the men"
1938.07.05,"A thunderstorm, still further to distract my already distracted brain. How am I to calm & contract back again to Roger? We returned on Saturday. Now this morning I settled to a difficult passage in P.H. Pippa rings up. 20 minutes with her about 3 Gs. L. comes in & asks me to choose 3 quotes for the Observer. Nessa brings Maynard on Julian. Lightning. Torrents. Yet I must slide beneath all this if I’m to make a job of the summer lap. I think I will read Roger tonight, & so slide down into the water, & I will use this final half hour of a ruined morning to type out my Skye notes—not that theyre worth it, save as an authentic relic, like a sprig or leaf torn from a hedge & pressed between the pages of a book. My hand staggers. I will type."
1938.07.07,"Oh the appalling grind of getting back to Roger, after these violent oscillations: 3 Gs. & P.H. How can I concentrate upon minute facts in letters? This morning I have forced myself back to Failand in 1888. But Gumbo [Marjorie Strachey] last night threw cold water on the whole idea of biography of those who have no lives. Roger had, she says, no life that can be written. I daresay this is true. And here am I sweating over minute facts. Its all too minute & tied down & documented. Is it to be done on this scale? Is he interesting to other people in that light? I think I will go on doggedly till I meet him myself—1909—& then attempt something more fictitious. But must plod on through all these letters till then. I think contrast the 2 all the time. My view, his & other peoples. And then his books. Meanwhile Freud (son) & John Lunch:. Sarton to tea; & I’m so raddled & raked with people, noise, telephones—cant copy my Skye notes: have endless letters to write, long for peace; holiday seems over; & what can I recover from all this litter? 3 G’s selling well⁠[:] 5,400 I think. But if I get into that mood I cant do anything at Roger. I must order & lay my mind out in pigeon holes. Now to change for lunch."
1938.07.17,"No time—Time wasted writing an angry letter to John about New Writing: letter shown to L. & torn up. My new clock says its just on one: & my new clock cant lie. So I note: 3 Gs has struck the rock of rage, I think; & sells very little—almost on 6,000—wont reach the 8… Then oh the rush of people. Susie telling me in strict confidence of her unutterable gilded fly boredom. Memoir Club. Desmond dined. Molly ill. Bunny read. Last night at the Robsons. Old French woman in skimpy black; beautiful eyes, playing Beethoven & looking round like Mitz at Juliette: their faces playing: voluptuous absorption & sorrow & exaltation. Lovely brown swollen cello—Old lady wd have been congenial to Roger. Rothenstein tomorrow to discuss Roger. I’m stuck in a bristle of dates. Cant get on. Wet, black cold—worst July on record—Morgan’s pageant. Kathleen Knott & Eddie dined. Ben & Judith & Rose [Macaulay] afterwards. Still letters come about 3 Gs. On the whole I’m pleased at the splash in the inkpots & hidden references in papers—indirect results. Not a word said of it by any of my family or intimates
"
1938.07.19,"What about yesterday as a specimen day? Work at Roger—fearful niggling drudgery till 15 to 1. Robson to lunch. Isherwood wants to see me at 3. I slip out; buy flowers for Madame Alwin, pate de foie for Adrian. Back at 3.15. peep in at Stephen Spender, Chris [Isherwood] & John & L. all talking in J.’s room. Receive present of deaths head [moth] in box from Jack [Hills]. Sit down upstairs. Visit Adrian, tea on balcony. Dog playing cars passing—Judith there. Ann to marry on Thursday. No invitations. Karin in & out. Look at house. Gossip & home. Will R⁠[othenstein]. to dine. A respectable, suppressed, but I dont think quite such a snake as Duncan makes out. Only dimmed, tamed; kindly, fairly obstinate: I think on his guard. No enthusiasm for life:—too much high nobility. But of course instructed, experienced, & kind. Only … Compared with R⁠[oger]. how blunted, tolerant, & a little plausible. Wished to make out a case, to some extent. Gave me letters. So to bed with sore lips. Nothing vivid about R. & Paris, all dim now. Wdn’t eat—abstemious. Fetched by a chauffeur & car. respectable. But not so slimy as they said.

Mercifully no one—I repeat no one—today. Today Julian was killed last year. And its hot again. Angelica’s first night in Regents Pk Lysistrata. So we go on. I shant say anything to Nessa. Oh dear—And shall I buy Desmond [?] a case? & myself a Chair? Or what? We go—this is an event for us—to the Ballet at Drury Lane in proper seats tonight. 3 Gs selling very slowly. Abusive or sneering letters the last 2 days."
1938.07.22,"If I were not rather proud of my abstracting power, how could I keep my head now, called on to write Roger a m: to interview Origo, [Lady] Simon &c. about 3 Gs. 5 to 7.: to combat John & the young generation this evening; to sympathise with Adrian, see Bussys, Rothensteins; give tea to Virginia Richards aged 8; & have Elizabeth Bowen, &c skirmishing in & out? Nor do I suspect that Rodmell will be a shelter. Mary threatens to come & stay. So I must exercise my new muscles; be adept at making compartments; filling them, like a pipe, full but not too full. I’m getting more adept at leaping from swing to swing this summer, better than last anyhow. Its odd how one’s friends torment one. Oh & Richard Hughes duns me for a written opinion on his book. Also theres Vita & her poem. And I have written to say that she must withdraw her charges.

Weather steamy but no longer blue. Sat in Gordon Sqre last night & D. & V. were we thought unreasonable about R. & W. Rn. & the Grafton. What a kettle of fish! And 3 Gs. is once more selling: has now broached the 6 thousand. But my new clock says it’s 2 mins. to one. The man came, like a doctor, to regulate. Ann was married yesterday. I gave her £15; L. £10. Thats all I’ve time for."
1938.07.26,"Its very true that I have no time. I have simply dedicated the last fortnight to people—seeing people—not a day free from it. Always an engagement. If you let it fill your sails there’s something to be said for it. But I’m doing it deliberately & so …—well: here’s a list: Elizabeth Bowen Saturday; Lehmann Sunday; Nessa & Duncan; Monday I will keep free after tea: in comes Angelica: but we talked about Julian, & I adored her sobriety & depth; am in doubts if she’ll stick at acting; today our Bussy dinner & others in afterwards; then Vita (oh she wired Horrified by your letter), to lunch: put off Noel & Virginia; D. asks me to tea to fetch my glass; then shall we go to Lysistrata in Regents Park: so we reach Thursday through this lit up gallery of many faces. And phones—& books. Buchan & Susie present theirs: Hughes his. And its now one. I’m staggering through Beaufort St."
1938.07.27,"Yesterday we had John to tea, & the Bussys to dinner, Chilvers in after dinner. Rather hard bilingual work. Simon praised W. Rothn. Inclined to laugh at B⁠[loomsbur]⁠y. He said they had never noticed his work. D⁠[oroth]⁠y. said this. Clive & Roger ignored him. Thought R⁠[oger]. an illuminé; his best work on Cézanne. Threw things over. Marchand dropped—put his hands out—down on the ground. But very learned & charming. Is Matisse sincere? asked him meeting in the street, 1910."
1938.08.04,"Monks House

What a very silly thing I did—not that it was my fault. I thought I knew the voice, asking for Mrs Woolf: & so got let into conversation with a woman called Coralie Anderson, a Dublin broadcaster, from New Zealand, at Newhaven: & had the idiotic good manners to say she could No: she had the tact not to come. come to a dull family tea party today: that is, a strange woman, of the most insensitive kind, may, indeed will, walk in, on top of Mrs Woolf Edgar & Sylvia today. And L. will be glum; & Mrs W. resent the interruption. The fact was, Vita was there: hence I answered the telephone. And this is how we escape to the peace of the country. Came down on Thursday; almost mute with botheration: 6 from Charleston on Sunday; Angus [Davidson] & Eddie [Playfair]; then Vita on Tuesday for the night & yesterday; & now this incongruous assembly. Yet we are very happy. I should add that we found a new gable thrown out in the roof, workmen hammering, Mr Wicks started work, without warning, & says he will be here 3 weeks which means 5. Two days ago L. had the brilliant idea of converting half the library into an open air verandah with glass doors, in which we can sit on a hot night & survey the stars. This is now in progress. We shall have a balcony & rails.

It has been very hot with a strong hot wind. And I’m taking a gallop in fiction, after bringing Roger to his marriage. Rather a jerk & an effort, my work at the moment. Switching from assiduous truth to wild ideas. But I liked seeing Vita, so free & easy again. We sat out here & discussed her loves; death; father Darcy on death; Ben’s tears, on being scolded by Vita; Willy Maugham; Clive, who’s writing a book, secretly, on war; Julian; Nessa; looking so ill; so many women have lost sons & lovers; I forget how it went. Also she brought a basket of peaches & half a bottle of Chateau Yquem from her mothers cellar. Nigel only got a third. He & Harold mind. She doesnt. And off she went in her great black car that impresses Mrs Bartholomew so, to entertain Mrs Rubens & her final husband, who likes fishing. She has a daily visitor—not to sleep though. She was much like old times.

I cant unstring my mind after trying to write about a lily pool. P.H. is to be a series of contrasts. Will it come off? Am I in earnest? Its to end with a play. L. is writing his in the garage room. I note he doesnt like to be asked when will it be done? He has, amusingly, all an artists sensibilities. And now?—Well there’s always a heap of Roger’s papers—old paper cuttings—to go through. And I might, of course, revise the last chapter: Beaufort Street; but am waiting for Bob’s notes. What an undertaking! R.’s 2 lives enough for 6 books: emotion & art."
1938.08.07,"I rather enjoy doing PH. Thats something, for it wont please anyone, if anyone should ever read it. Ann Watkins by the way says the Atlantic readers haven’t read enough of Walpole to understand my article. Refused. Thats another reason then for my Outsider to be born. The Times Lit Sup this week has an article discussing, among other views, Mrs Woolf’s view on intellectual harlotry. I rather think the book wh sells slowly is sinking in. ,

Yesterday I saw 6 tanks with gun carriages come clambering down the hill & assemble like black beetles at Rat Farm. Small boys playing idiotic games for which I pay. Harold is very dismal, Vita says: predicts war, but not this week. A lull at the moment. And terrifically hot. A great purple black cloud massed itself behind Mrs W. Sylvia & Edgar as they sat out here; then thunder: then rain, at last. And we had lights lit. Why they so rub the country bloom off—these family Woolves—I dont know. Always a dusty feeling of Earls Court & offices. Oh & the commonplaceness of the talk—mostly about furniture at Lexham: lovely silver mirrors, most artistic overmantels, suites of dining room chairs, coffee cups. She lies awake counting them, deciding who’s to have what, & so falls asleep. Why is it all so low in tone, even as human life? Sylvia might be one slice of bread off the eternal loaf. Workmen tapping. The verandah being cut open. Yesterday the men about the wireless. Too many gadgets & dodges perhaps in this house. And the children shrieking. But we go to Charleston for tea: & Bob has written, revising in some respects my chapter: upon which I start work again tomorrow. I plan a short chapter on marriage; then a difficult one on R.’s early work; some discussion of his theories & development; so to Hampstead & America. So to the Post I⁠[mpressionists]. & ourselves. That will make the break in the book. A change of method. Then the Omega: before the war. Then the Dalmeny, Bernard Street. Consummation. So (here at least) the end is in sight. I may have it written over by Xmas; re-written by next August. Out in spring of 1940?"
1938.08.17,"No I won’t go on doing Roger—abstracting with blood & sweat from the old Articles—right up to lunch maybe. I will steal 25 minutes … In fact I’ve been getting absorbed in Roger. Didnt I say I wouldn’t? Didnt L. say theres no hurry? Except that I’m 56; & think that Gibbon then allowed himself 12 years, & died instantly. Still why always chafe & urge & strain at the leash? What I want is a season of calm weather. Contemplation. I get this sometimes about 3 am when I always wake, open my window, & look at the sky over the apple trees. A tearing wind last night. Every sort of scenic effect—a prodigious toppling & cleaving & massing, after the sunset that was so amazing L. made me come & look out of the bathroom window—a flurry of red clouds; hard; a watercolour mass of purple & black, soft as a water ice; thin hard slices of intense green stone; blue stone, & a ripple of crimson light. No: that wont convey it: & then there were the trees in the garden. & the reflected light: our hot pokers burning on the edge of the steep.

I’m too tired in the head & fingers to sum up. We have been sociable in a scattered way. Seen Edgar’s new house,—& Mr Colbourne’s Alsatians, routing Gwen’s pocket handkerchief from a tub of rags, jumping through fiery hoops, & also retrieving L.’s bandanna from a distant field. All dogs can do this, Mr C. said. A dog at its prime at 3. Dogs entirely changed by education. For this, see 3 Gs. (wh. stops selling, between 6 & 7000: but still wrings letters from schoolmasters. Oh & I must answer one of them).

I began Mme de Sevigne last night. Then there was the sunset, & then some music on the new set. The window, with the round top, is going in today. Less noise than I expected.

The old woman who lived up at Mt Misery drowned herself 3 days ago. The body was found near Piddinghoe—my usual walk. Her son died; she turned queer; had been a midwife in Brighton; lived in the broken windowed half of Mr Bradfield’s house. She used to moon over the downs with a dog. Once she came to the shop late on Sunday to beg 2d of paraffin—she was alone in the dark. They threatened to turn her out—farm wanted. She had killed her dog. So at last off she goes, on Monday perhaps when the tide was high in the afternoon, & jumps in. Louie says her brother found a drowned woman the other day at Barcombe Mills—a horrid sight. So I order dinner hastily & come out here to brew more Roger. But I wont go into my doubts—partly due to reading B.J. by his wife & thinking it richer & warmer & more important than Morgan on Goldie. So, at supper, we discussed our generation: & the prospects of war. Hitler has his million men now under arms. Is it only summer manoeuvres or—? Harold broadcasting in his man of the world manner hints it maybe war. That is the complete ruin not only of civilisation, in Europe, but of our last lap. Quentin conscripted &c. One ceases to think about it—thats all. Goes on discussing the new room, new chair, new books. What else can a gnat on a blade of grass do? And I would like to write PH.: & other things. I worry a little over the young generation & its complacent compromises. This is partly of course that we sold the HP share very cheap: that Mrs Lehmann [Johns mother] lives in far greater style than we do; that the young in short have an eye to the main chance, a bitter tongue, & a fawning way of asking sympathy. Thats my nettle under the mattress; but a very little frail one—not so stinging as a row that once lasted a whole month here with Colefax. I mean one of those nagging worries that I say aloud when I’m walking.

Tonight we dine off the first grouse at Charleston. Q.’s birthday. Oh & we went to Pulborough & saw A. act—but I forget—I may have written this down—so casual am I in what I say or dont say: & have half a mind one of these days to explain what my intention is in writing these continual diaries. Not publication. Revision? a memoir of my own life? Perhaps. Only other things crop up. Pippa says Waller [Jack Hills] has been desperately ill. Logan [Pearsall Smith] has recovered—as Logan would."
1938.08.22,"The first, I think, really soaking wet day since we came. We therefore went into Lewes about the threat of the Sewage Pump. They want to plant it on us: ‘they’ being instigated by Jansen & Botten so L. suspects. The village cabal against us is roused by the L.P. & the Village Council matter, & they are rumoured (Percy says) to be going to seize our field for a play ground. This delightful sample of village life—the egg under the microscope—doesn’t please: such is human nature. Also I am in the wars, or shall be. Maynard sends for us on Wednesday; is said by Lydia to be very critical of 3 Gs: & a note in the Observer (Hayward) says that Miss Wilson is preparing a counter-blast; & no-one can better correct, contradict & amplify than she. Now the thing to remember is that I’m an independent & perfectly established human being: no one can bully me: & at the same time nothing shall make me shrivel into a martyr or a bitter persecution maniac. The one specific is to write a thorough good book—i.e. Roger. I’ve not got the words right about the soul. I mean I stand on my own feet. Maynard & the rest can only puff: & the honesty of my intention in 3 Gs is bound to see me through. But this is written in too great detail. In fact I must now, as we cant play bowls, read my Roger chapter: after the criticism I must … but not here. All Charleston & William Plomer yesterday: a lovely thin blue day. Bowls. Nessa painted, better I think. Clive talked. I liked him—he has some shiver of sensibility still."
1938.08.23,"Its odd to be as nervous as I am at the idea of seeing Maynard tomorrow, & his heckling: dear old Hitler. But I wont be nervous; I’ll go & walk on the terrace for 10 minutes before lunch. The worst of this kind of controversy is that it adds so much friction to my work on Roger: I have to urge my mind on, while the surface is all worried & flurried into tufts & vapours of replies [&] arguments. So it kindles, like a meteor, & burns, instead of keeping cool & dark & solid as I had hoped this summer. The price I pay, though, for having views. Never mind. Now the terrace—& a treat this afternoon [a drive to Tunbridge Wells]."
1938.08.28,"The character of this summer is extreme drought. Brooks dry. Not a mushroom yet. By the way Maynard never said a word. Some were unsaid. As for instance, Lydia: we all put up with you Virginia, said significantly, kissing me at parting. M. tired, extended, rather grim. But emotion had to be restrained. Sunday is the devils own day at M.H. Dogs, children, bells…. there they go for evensong. I cant settle any where. Beaten after 3 hard fights at bowls. Bowls is our mania. Reading rather scamped. I’m strung into a ball with Roger—got him, very stiffly to the verge of America. I shall take a dive into fiction; then compose the chapter that leads to the change. But is it readable—& Lord to think of the further compressing & leavening.

Ding dong bell…. ding dong—why did we settle in a village? And how deliberately we are digging ourselves in! And at any moment the guns may go off & explode us. L. is very black. Hitler has his hounds only very lightly held. A single step—in Cheko Slovakia—like the Austrian Archduke in 1914 & again its 1914. Ding dong ding dong. People all strolling up & down the fields. A grey close evening. Dr Chavasse died on Friday, while Nessa & Q. were here—she to paint the view—he my table. Oh thank God, Ding dong—no, its begun again.

I should call it a very free summer, happy compared with last. However, I cant go into that. I mean Julian’s ghost. How could he ever become a ghost—My dear Aunt—then the burst of laughter; & how he gripped the sides of the chair. Angelica announces that she is giving up the stage. That I think revives Nessa. At any rate they are free—more united—& go to Cassis. I ponder—as usual—a flight to the Maurons. But shall I get there? Sybil [Colefax] meanwhile thrusts herself on us, for dinner; we have the Jones’s at Seaford: visits to London; must say good bye to Bella. The autumn mists assemble. And I’m irritable with work & noise. We dine at Charleston. Now its as quiet as the grave .. all grey; the chestnut leaves hanging heavy; birds on the telegraph posts.

Letters fret me. Never one thats disinterested. Requests always to speak, write, lecture, see people. Thats Fame—dogs again. Thats because Miss Emery is with the dead I suppose. Yap Yap. Perhaps the house would be better & Madame de Sevigne—who may inspire me, as good writing does, to write to Ethel—so no more."
1938.08.31,"War seemed round the corner again. Question what Hitler will do, when he’ll do it. Cabinet Ministers summoned. &, of course, Kingsley Martin ringing up, & annoyed that L. isn’t in London to hold his hand, & make it write an article. I say As if articles mattered! We were in London yesterday. Streets fuller than last time, perhaps, by reason of the Crisis. K.M. to lunch—stout & dark & brown & black & theatrical. 3 possibilities. One of them European war. But not at once. A game of bluff on H⁠[itler]’s part, possibly. Anyhow he doesn’t want a European war now. So may isolate the shindy; & we may rat with the French at the last moment. If theres a war, “my own solution is suicidal”—while he munches mutton chops, & sweeps up fragments, scraping his knife & fork round in a way I hate. But cant hate anyone in the flesh. So he burbled on: with his own article, & his own figure, histrionically arrayed, in the centre. Some bye-references, with an eye to me, on the Prostitution of Journalists. I walked off, bought a pewter plate, a scissors, & a lustre globe, encouraged by a letter from Brace reporting enthusiasm for 3 Gs in our office, good advance orders, & great praise. Also encouraged by the E⁠[uropea]⁠n situation: gather rosebuds while we may. So we came back to find the roof painted a first coat of white; men erecting L.’s new Crystal Palace greenhouse in the orchard; & the fireplace ready in the new room.

Sally was mated on Monday, with much coyness: we had tea with Mrs Jones, Hugh, & a sturdy girl who’s going to teach a school in Bexhill. Mrs Jones like a pricked air ball flopped on the floor. Hugh the spit of Philip."
1938.09.01,"A very fine clear September day. Sybil threatens to dine, but may put us off—should a Cabinet Minister crop up. Politics marking time. A violent attack on 3 Gs in Scrutiny by Q. Leavis. I dont think it gave me an entire single thrill of horror. And I didnt read it through. A symbol though of what wiggings are to come. But I read eno’ to see that it was all personal—about Queenie’s own grievances & retorts to my snubs. Why I dont care more for praise or wigging I dont know. Yet its true. A slight distaste for my biog. of Roger this morning: too detailed & flat. But I must take it up tomorrow, & lay aside P.H. I fear. Quentin over to finish his table. We have settled to keep the roof Cornish cream colour. I found a new walk down Telscombe valley to the river yesterday.

Oh Queenie was at once cancelled by a letter from Jane Walker—a thousand thanks … 3 Gs ought to be in the hands of every English speaking man & woman &c."
1938.09.05,"Its odd to be sitting here, looking up little facts about Roger & the M⁠[etropolitan] M⁠[useum]. in New York, with a sparrow tapping on my roof this fine September morning when it may be the 3rd Aug 1914 … What would war mean? Darkness, strain: I suppose conceivably death. And all the horror of friends: & Quentin … All that lies over the water in the brain of that ridiculous little man. Why ridiculous? Because none of it fits. Encloses no reality. Death & war & darkness representing nothing that any human being from the Pork butcher to the Prime Minister cares one straw about. Not liberty, not life … merely a housemaids dream. And we woke from that dream & have the Cenotaph to remind us of the fruits. Well I cant spread my mind wide eno’ to take it in, intelligibly. If it were real, one cd. make something of it. But as it is it merely grumbles, in an inarticulate way, behind reality. We may hear his mad voice vociferating tonight. Nuremberg rally begun: but it goes on for another week. And what will be happening this time 10 days? Suppose we skim across, still at any moment, any accident may suddenly bring out the uproar. But this time everyone’s agog. Thats the difference. And as we’re all equally in the dark we cant cluster & gossip; we are beginning to feel the herd impulse: everyone asks everyone, Any news? What d’you think? The only answer is, wait & see. Sybil fresh from London, can only titivate this answer into shapes that reveal her own complicity, but utter ignorance. The talk, when she came that wet evening [1 September] all the way from London to dine, turned most satisfactorily upon the Windsors; & how, as he came late into Willy Maugham’s lunch party, he said, “Her Royal Highness was detained by the American sailors…” That is what he will have her called.

Old Mr Thomsett meanwhile after driving horses to the brooks & about the fields for 74 years has died in the hospital. & L. is to read his will on Wednesday. He left it all—how much?—to Doris; & Annie thinks the other children will protest. L. made his will for him. I like this in L."
1938.09.10,"I dont feel that the crisis is real—not so real as Roger in 1910 at Gordon Square, about which I’ve just been writing; & now switch off with some difficulty to use the last 20 minutes that are over before lunch. Of course we may be at war this time next week. Seven ships are mobilised today. The Papers each in turn warns Hitler in the same set grim but composed words, dictated by the Govt, presumably, that if he forces us we shall fight. They are all equally calm & good tempered. Nothing is to be said to provoke. Every allowance is to be made. In fact we are simply marking time as calmly as possible until Monday or Tuesday, when the Oracle will speak. And we mean him to know what we think. The only doubt is whether what we say reaches his own much cumbered long ears. (I’m thinking of Roger not of Hitler—how I bless Roger, & wish I could tell him so, for giving me himself to think of—what a help he remains—in this welter of unreality.) All these grim men appear to me like grown up’s staring incredulously at a child’s sand castle which for some inexplicable reason has become a real vast castle, needing gunpowder & dynamite to destroy it. Nobody in their senses can believe in it. Yet nobody must tell the truth. So one forgets. Meanwhile the aeroplanes are on the prowl, crossing the downs. Every preparation is made. Sirens will hoot in a particular way when there’s the first hint of a raid. L. & I no longer talk about it. Much better to play bowls & pick dahlias. They’re blazing in the sitting room, orange against the black last night. Our balcony is now up. Today Morgan comes, & we have our crowded Memoir Club week end. It is at Tilton, in the afternoon, to suit Maynard, who is going to read. Q. & Molly lunch here tomorrow, & I’ve no doubt we shall all behave as if the moment were eternal—as Roger said to Goldie. What other attitude—but its not one—is possible to even moderately adult people? As far as I can judge the villagers share it. Whats the use of war? We dont want war. Thats Louie’s verdict. But our candidate, our little Mr Black who dined here the other night, has the brains of a rabbit, reminds me of Tisdall, will only talk of his daughter’s pet mice—she breeds many coloured mice which she sells for 5d to a local breeder, & his other girl makes posters depicting mice, while he himself collects matchboxes—well, he’s the average politician, I suppose: & he’s all for war, at once. Why? to build a new state … & what kind of new state? One in which mice & matchboxes are collected."
1938.09.11,"Morgan here. He is writing in the garden. L. in his room. I have been sorting old cuttings out here. Molly & Q. will soon come. A very fine clear spruce blue day. The news as black as possible. Hitler has at any rate cursed, & Goering spat: nothing said till tomorrow. And now in to the house to tidy rooms & hair. Easy & intimate with M⁠[organ]. about GLD⁠[ickinson] & Roger &c. He wears a new tie given by Stephen Tennan⁠[t]"
1938.09.12,"Papers all say that we shall know the truth, one way or the other, tonight. But Maynard yesterday thought Hitler may say nothing for some days. The Cabinet all occupied whenever they emerge—sitting all day—in making plain without actual statement that we shall fight if France fights. Press all harmonious. So there’s nothing to do but wait.

Memoir Club meeting had its little sensation. M⁠[olly] & Q. lunched. After lunch, as she came down stairs, M. tripped & fell over the loose tile. Lay very white in great pain. Cdnt move. Obviously a bad twist. After a time we managed to hop her to the terrace—sat & talked; but when we had to go, she couldn’t move. Ankle swollen. So we took her, after various telephones, to [Dr] Tooth’s substitute: & he—a blue serge red faced knobby man—was afraid the bone was hurt. Then the X ray: the man out: at last to Tilton; carried her in. Maynard read a very packed profound & impressive paper so far as I could follow, about Cambridge youth; their philosophy; its consequences; Moore; what it lacked; what it gave. The beauty & unworldliness of it. I was impressed by M. & felt a little flittery & stupid. Then he had to rest; it turned grey & cold. M. had to be slowly conveyed—a bed made on the ground floor at Charleston. Nevertheless a very human satisfactory meeting. Tea: Lydia presiding, “Now boys & girls sit down.” Hot cakes. Ham sandwiches. No politics. Bunny, Desmond, Q. & Lydia, ourselves Morgan Clive Nessa (in big hat: much more herself than ever yet). Rachel is to have a baby. Molly very much more composed: brave; matter of fact; & heard what we said. But we are off now to lunch with William [Plomer] at Brighton, taking Morgan."
1938.09.13,"No war yet anyhow. Hitler boasted & boomed but shot no solid bolt. Mere violent rant, & then broke off. We listened in to the end. A savage howl like a person excruciated; then howls from the audience; then a more spaced & measured sentence. Then another bark. Cheering ruled by a stick. Frightening to think of the faces. & the voice was frightening. But as it went on we said (only picking a word or two) anti-climax. This seems to be the general verdict. He darent cross the line. Comes up to it & stands bawling insults. Times very scathing & sarcastic. How can people stand this nonsense? Negotiations to go on, under threat that he will use force if &c.

Immense relief last night at Monk’s House, after a gloomy dinner. Very hot. Jaded with Brighton. Lunch with Wm & Morgan at a place where he knew the waitress. I depressed by praise of Morgan’s Credo: silence on all my friends part about my own. But the impersonal attitude worked well. I let myself sink like a bag from a balloon: & felt, if dejected, light & free. A good piece of work that, for it leaves me free to go on my way in silence. Not from journalists or schoolmasters though. A great packet of reviews from USA. All summer in a day again. Oh we enjoy being alone, save that I’m too jaded to do Roger. Wicks here about the tiles. John tomorrow. London & farewell to Charleston on Thursday. Peaceful if depressed: anyhow a week or 2 without war.

Odd this new public anxiety: how it compares with private: how it blinds: but too stupid to write. And lunch waiting this roasting hot morning."
1938.09.14,"Things worse today. Rioting in Prague. Sudeten ultimatum. It looks as if Hitler meant to slide sideways into war. Raises riots: will say cant be stopped. This came on the 9.30 wireless last night. This morning more marking time. No one knows. Headachy, partly screw of Roger: partly this gloom. So I’m stopping Roger; as we go up to lunch with Bella tomorrow. And whats the private position? So black I cant gather together. Work I suppose. If it is war, then every country joins in: chaos. To oppose this with Roger my only private position. Well thats an absurd little match to strike. But its a hopeless war this—when we know winning means nothing. So we’re committed, for the rest of our lives, to public misery. This will be slashed with private too. Quentin: all the young married people. Ann &c. We—L. & I—can make out I suppose down here: vegetables & fruit. And I’ve made some money. Needn’t cringe. Thats about all. I feel I said what I wanted in 3 Gs. & am not to care if its 1: made my own friends hostile; laid me open to abuse & ridicule; also praise where I dont want it; & paying bills for Wms. Societies: £3.9 for a ridiculous leaflet—Thats my debt to civilisation. Then suppose John called up! The Press? But all wallows & wavers in complete chaos. Odd that this should be a stimulus to the complete artist. One will have to sit at home & write. I suppose air raids may toss a bomb through the skylight. Growls go on overhead. Louie says the carpenter is on the reserve. They chaff him as he’s a socialist. 1914 but without even the illusion of 1914. All slipping consciously into a pit.

But John lunches. Q. & A. to tea. Dine tomorrow at Charleston. Fine summer day."
1938.09.16,"Chamberlain has flown to see Hitler. Universal relief & approval. No news yet. They say this means Peace. Peace was written large on the Evening Standard placard yesterday in London. There’ll be no war, the shopkeeper in Long Acre said when I bought cardboard for Eddie’s book. Rosinsky says they will give way. Hitler will save his prestige: the C⁠[zecho] S⁠[lovak]⁠s will be sacrificed. War staved off for one year. But until the wireless announces the result of the visit—& there’s to be another—tonight we once again mark time. Nessa Duncan Angelica & Q. start for Cassis tonight, driving across France. We settle in for 10 days alone—that is, Clive & Janice come on Sunday; but I mean to make these 3 weeks serve me to finish, sketch out rather, the last chapters.

Dined at Charleston. All seem agreed that a country life is best. Clive is giving notice to Gordon Square. We hear or rather the Garden Comttee heard, that T. Sqre will be pulled down in 3 years. Shall we not all provide ourselves with single rooms in London & live here? Never make any fixed plans for life—thats my motto. Really, for the 10 years that remain, be free of the world. But I’m kicking my heels with P.H. after Roger this morning, & the relief of fiction after all that fact, lightens the load of both worlds inconceivably. And I feel so free from any criticism; own no authority.

HAL Fisher asks me to go & see him. After my remarks on OM’s this is conciliatory. He wants me to send a signed copy. And his time is drawing out: resignation impending. Very fine clear weather. I saw a kingfisher. The lunch [with Mrs Woolf and Bella] was very heavy, stodgy, full of meat & wine. Walked down the Strand all a buzzing, full season feeling, in the afternoon."
1938.09.17,"Chamberlain back. In a hard business man’s voice told us, as he stepped out of the plane at Croydon, that he was to meet Hitler again: that Hitler was coming to meet an old man half way (is this symbolical?) & we meanwhile not to believe rumour. No statement today. Cabinet meeting. Just as in violent personal anxiety, the public lapses, into complete indifference. One can feel no more at the moment. And its the essence of an English September. Saw the yearling sale at Northease yesterday. Mrs Mounsey writes to ask me to head an Outsiders’ movement. Clive & Janice tomorrow. Nessa &c lunching now at Auppegard—& thats all for the moment. I thought yesterday, enjoying my valley walk, that Julian wd entirely have approved of that. And, oddly enough, I never said that the whole summer here was set on its feet the first day by L. visiting the Lewes Dr who pronounced him absolutely normal. Yet I suppose it was the most important feeling of all. We met on the towing path the very day after we came here.

Dreamt of Julian one night: how he came back: I implored him not to go to Spain. He promised. Then I saw his wounds. Dreamt of Roger last night. How he had not died. I praised Cezanne. And told him how I admired his writing. Exactly the old relationship. Perhaps easier to get this in dreams, because one has dreamt away the fact of his death, to which I woke as L. came in."
1938.09.20,"Since I’m too stale to work—rather headachy—I may as well write a sketch roughly of the next chapter. (I’ve been rather absorbed in P.H. hence headache. Note: fiction is far more a strain than biography—thats the excitement.)

Suppose I make a break after H⁠[elen’]⁠s death (madness). A separate paragraph quoting what R. himself said. Then a break. Then begin definitely with the first meeting. That is the first impression: a man of the world not professor or Bohemian. Then give facts in his letters to his mother. Then back to the second meeting.

Pictures. Talk, about art. I look out of window. His persuasiveness—a certain density—wished to persuade you to like what he liked. Eagerness—absorption—stir—a kind of vibration like a hawkmoth round him. Or shall I make a scene here—at Otts?

Then C⁠[onstantino]⁠ple. Driving out—getting things in—his deftness in combining. Then quote the letters to R.

The first 1910 show.

The ridicule. Quote W⁠[ilfred] Blunt.

Effect on R. Another close up.

The letter to MacColl. His own personal liberation. Excitement. Found his method (but this wasn’t lasting, his letters to V⁠[anessa]. show that he was swayed too much by her.)

Love. How to say that he now was in love?

Give the pre-war atmosphere. Ott. Duncan. France. Letter to Bridges about beauty & sensuality. His exactingness. Logic."
1938.09.22,"By mistake I wrote some pages of Roger here; a proof, if proof is needed, as I’m in the habit of saying, that my books are in a muddle. Yes, at this moment, there are packets of letters to V.B. 1910-1916—packets of testimonials for the Oxford Slade—endless folders, each containing different letters, Press Cuttings, & extracts from books. In between come my own, now numerous, semi-official 3 Gs letters (now sold 7,017..) I never get a disinterested letter: always demands. But all the same we get asked to have Noel & Virginia, Judith, & go to Sissinghurst in order that L. may discuss politics with Harold. No sober silent weeks of work alone all day as we’d planned, when the Bells went. I suppose one enjoys it. Yet I was just getting into the old, very old, rhythm of regular reading, first this book then that; Roger all the morning; walk from 2 to 4; bowls 5 to 6.30: then Madame de Sevigne; get dinner 7.30; read Roger; listen to music; bind Eddie’s Candide; read Siegfried Sassoon; & so bed at 11.30 or so. A very good rhythm; but I can only manage it for a few days it seems. Next week all broken. A minor treat today: solicitor in Lewes; then walk …

The public fluctuates. Chamberlain flying today to Gotesberg (?). A strong opposition has risen. Eden, Churchill & the L⁠[abour] P⁠[arty] all denounce serving C.S. on the altar & bidding it commit suicide. CS. very dignified & tragic. Everyone calling everyone else a pick pocket. The prospect of another glissade after a minor stop into abyss. All Europe in Hitler’s keeping. What’ll he gobble next? Thats the summary of us in Sussex."
1938.09.28,"This may be the last day of peace; so why not record it, as I’ve 20 minutes & nothing to do? Why record it? But this “why?” has to be battened down.

A tumultuous week end—Judith, Noel & Virginia; Charleston: Clive Janice Raymond. Pouring wet Monday. L. came out to say Kingsley Martin begged him to come up, in order to act as liaison between the LP & the Liberals. He was the only person &c. So we decided to go at once & spend the night. Drove up in the rain. Men digging trenches at Turnham Green. London crowded. Dropped Judith. L. went to see K.M. I to buy coffee &c. “Its a miserable day & our thoughts are miserable” the woman at de Bry [Coffee Merchants, New Oxford Street] said. She said we should win; & that it would not be a long war. “But whats the point of winning?” I said, at which she exclaimed & shrugged her shoulders in agreement. Then KM to dinner; charcoal black round the eyes; as usual something histrionic. All about his article in the NS: had he been wrong? We’ve all been wrong. A desire to confess. But also very wretched. Hopelessly restless. Melodramatic in his gestures, swaying as he walked to the telephone; perpetually looking at the time & ringing people up. Got the BBC. “Well A.C. Whats Hitler said? Ah hah—” Then Phil Baker. Do you agree with what I wrote? No word of any possible plan or reason for summoning L. Stayed on, drinking, smoking. Then said he was going to walk the streets. Couldnt sleep. Still thought it possible we should rat. Also Phil said Hitler would cry off. So to bed. Telephones all the morning. I went to the London Library. Sat in the basement & looked up The Times on PIP [Post-Impressionism] in 1910. Old sweeper gently dusting. Came & said, Theyre telling us to try on our masks. Have you got yours I asked. No not yet. And shall we have war? I fear so, but I still hope not. I live out in Putney. Oh theyve laid in sand bags; the books will be moved; but if a bomb strikes the house…. May I dust under your chair? I looked in at the Nat Gall, being warned by a sober loud speaker to get my gas mask as I walked down Pall Mall. A man repeats this warning through a megaphone as he drives. A lecture being given by a red faced elderly man on Watteau & French painting. A largish crowd following. I looked at Renoir, Cezanne &c: tried to see through Roger’s eyes: tried to get some solidity into my mind. So to lunch. Question what to do about the Press. The girls sensible but of course apprehensive. Plans can only be sketched. Possibly John will transport the whole Press to Fieldhead. Nothing can be done till Saturday. House meets today. We arranged for Mabel to go to Bristol. We shall stay here, provisionally. I went to Lewis & bought folders.* We must settle into * The boy there the only person I saw obviously frightened & therefore snappy & rude—poor little wretch. work at any rate. We must drive our pens & keep the Press going that way. Rain settled in. Miss Moir of the Forum arrived at 3.15—& John & Rosinsky for L. She was a painted battered professional journalist. Wants controversial articles: £20 only: but can say what I like, I gave her vermouth. Stayed talking. Sister of a Suffolk clergyman. The Govt, is evacuating the East End to Suffolk. All cottages prepared to billet.

So it goes on. We had a rather unpleasant farewell with the Press—they staying, we going. Its reasonable of course. But one doesnt like leaving them there: & yet they want to stay, for the money. We may have to pay them, or let them go, & try to keep on paying. But as L. & I say, we cant now decide, or think. A violent rain storm; a great crowd in the streets. The worst—longest drive in half lights under trees, rain splashed; & so late that we only got here at 8.15. Poor Louie missed the PM’s broadcast. He said nothing—except that we cd not fight for the small C.S. matter only—a possible hint. But we’ve given up stressing the importance of hints. Hitler seems as they say “for it.” These futile notes are now ended by lunch. It was oddly peaceful & sane, getting out here after London. Mr Perkins brought gas masks about 10.30. & so at last we went to bed."
1938.09.29,"We listened in yesterday at 5 expecting to hear that War was declared. Instead “Mr Chamberlain made a sensational announcement. He has been invited by Herr Hitler to meet him tomorrow at Munich. Signor Mussolini & Daladier will be present. Mobilisation is postponed for 24 hours.” It was like coming out of a dark room. Now we are waiting. Some compromise? The selling of the C.S? What? Anyhow war for the moment is postponed. Perkins & Janson called last night to say 50 children arrive in Rodmell today & to note numbers of our rooms. Off to Sissinghurst this afternoon to see Harold."
1938.09.30,"L. has just come in, it being 11.15. to say that he overheard a Broadcast when he was in the W.C.: dashed out: turned on our wireless; & heard that terms are being made at Munich. I cant go into them. But it means peace. That was the upshot of the stop press in The Times this morning. They are agreeing to let some Germans into C.S. today: then English Italian & French are to enter & guarantee: then a 3 months pause. Three months in which to settle the question, instead of bombs on London & Paris today! Well, Chamberlain must be looking on the bright sunshine this morning with a good deal of relief. He went off yesterday quoting Hotspur “Out of this nettle danger we pluck the flower safety”—words that Katherine Mansfield has on her tomb. Such a reversal was never known: save that there was always a huger nightmare unreality that clouded all distinct feeling. I’m doing Roger & PIP [Post-Impressionism] & must break off this historical note to go back to that.

Harold kept in London caballing with Winston & Eden to keep the PM from giving away too much. Certainty of peace not quite certain yesterday; but the 9,000 children who were to have come to Sussex held up. The obvious feeling everywhere was We dont want this war. No glorification, as Mrs Dean [the smith’s wife] remarked: the mouthpiece of the nation, as much as Chamberlain. Oh & the K. of Italy is said to have stiffened Musso: who stiffened Ch⁠[amberlai]⁠n., & thus weakened Hitler, by threatening abdication. So Vita reported from Harold.

I will continue, as I have 10 minutes before lunch: continue that is to try & describe the reversal; which is soberly & truly life after death. For we, even if we escaped, should have had our noses rubbed in death; ruin; perhaps the end finally of all order, so L. admitted was his background. It would have meant our last 15 years of life spent in battling for a thread of liberty; keeping the Press going among the deaths of the young. And now suddenly we can travel & move & use our normal faculties. No slaughter of the young beneath us. I wonder if we could have faced it even here—entertaining East end children in the hall; writing; getting all the dismal fag ends of things thrown us; & reading Casualty Lists. Now of course one makes not new resolutions, but attacks the old with some fervour. They seem to have blood in them. I wonder how far we cd. really get a move on; make a difference, if we tried? Possibly—sanguinely—a new view will dominate. Hitler will sink instead of swell. But what a shave! Northease Barn already turned into a hospital; Gwen’s daughter “evacuated” to school at Stanmer Park; 60 children laid on mattresses in the gallery; marvels of organisation recited on the BBC last night. All who wish to leave London to go to certain tube stations, with a thick coat & enough food for the day: children to bring no [?] glass bottles: parents not to come. Public will then be taken free of charge to towns & villages 50 miles out of London. Each will be given a stamped card on wh. to write to friends. No choice of destination. &c. Eddy Sackville volunteered to drive an ambulance in London. Food all arranged for. The net result is that we are presented with 2 gas masks by the Govt: & have bought 4 candlesticks at Woolworths, & ordered an extra supply of coals.

A very fine day."
1938.10.01,"A violent storm—purple ink clouds—dissolving like blots of ink in water—strong enough to drive us in here in the middle of our game. L. is storing apples—finest harvest for perhaps some years. No longer a matter of concern. We were to live on apples honey & cabbage. Postman delivered an oration—“just my own thoughts” on War & Dictators. How all will worship C⁠[hamberlai]⁠n. now: but in 5 years time we may be saying we ought to have put him, Hitler, down now. These dictators & their lust for power—they cant stop. He’ll get stronger & stronger. Then … But now we cant help being glad of peace. Its human nature. We’re made that way. A solid clear spoken if repetitive private thinker who kept our letters waiting 10 minutes. Only the N. Statesman &c. Soon looked through & tossed aside. Peace when they went to Press hung on a straw. Now grown (we suppose) to a rope—unless this storm is symbolical; its odd how susceptible the mind becomes to weather symbols—roping everything in—in crises like this is, or was. Of course there’s bound to be a turn against relief—but I’m watching the storm—as in violent illness. One turns peevish & has a sense of emptiness. I should fill this now either by letter writing or sketching R. wh last as the least burdensome, I will do."
1938.10.02,"Yesterday would have been the first day of the proclamation of war. It might be amusing to scribble down pall mall some higgledy piggledy of incidents: as they remain over; & will soon be forgotten.

The BBC in a measured trained voice: how the public was to go with warm clothing: no glasses: post cards: this interrupted by the ArchB’s prayers: then cold menace: a spaced dictated message from the Admiralty to ships. Obviously we’d sunk mines. Then the afternoon (Wednesday) when all foreign stations were jammed. War broken out already L. thought. Then the statement that all poisonous snakes at the Zoo would be killed, & dangerous animals shot—Vision of London ravaged by cobras & tigers. Sense of preparation to the last hair. Some complacency on the part of organisers. How Mrs Nicholls was refused the key of the Square: trenches only available to residents. All this mixture of minute detail; with invocations to God; with Hitler baying & the Germans howling; then the composed & cultured voice breaking in, say about not taking pets. Then over all a feeling of the senselessness, futility, so that there was a dilution of emotion. A childs game. Yet extreme physical relief when peace seemed 24 hours longer. Some instinctive self preservation. I felt this most when we drove away from 52, a selfish gladness that we should be quietly in the country. Some remorse at leaving the clerks exposed. Now rapidly other emotions chase each other; that peace seems dull, solid. Then that we must have a bone to gnaw. The opposition already marshalling & we shall be attacked. Some obliquity: after all we admired Chn. in the crisis. Is it fair to abuse him now? Duff Cooper has resigned. A wet day. Keynes come to tea."
1938.10.03,"The Keynes to tea yesterday. All a put up job between Chamberlain & Hitler, Maynard said. Never had been any chance of war. But I’ve written this to Nessa & cant repeat. I wish I could get the ripples of all these complexities to land. I’m incapable still of sinking into R⁠[oger]. Rain. Wind. Apples falling. M. & Lydia very congenial—dear old M. so sanguine, so powerful, somehow lovable too, & Lord how brilliant. I kissed him. Hope all is forgotten & forgiven. A life time—what remains—of peace now. Auden & I.’s play to be suppressed. Out of date. And I hope they will no longer pose as the young men to be sacrificed. All orientations must now change. Duff Cooper resigned. Reaction of shame beginning. D.T. decent, & starts a pro Czech movement. Times disgraceful. Harold censured &c."
1938.10.06,"Another 10 minutes. I’m taking a frisk at P.H. at wh. I can only write for one hour. Like the Waves, I enjoy it intensely: head screwed up over Roger. A violent storm two days ago. No walking. Apples down. Electric light cut off. We used the 4 6d candlesticks bought at Woolworths. Dinner cooked, & smoked, on dining room fire. Men now staining boards. The room will be done actually this week. Politics now a mere “I told you so … You did—I didnt”. I shall cease to read the papers. Sink at last into contemplation. Peace for our life time: why not try to believe it? Cant make a push & go to S. Remy. Want to—dont want to. Long for change; love reading Sevigné even by candlelight. Long for London & lights; long for vintage; long for complete solitude. All this discussed with L. walking to Piddinghoe yesterday.

E. Bowen has sent her book; also Marie Mauron."
1938.10.13,"I should be well advised to take a holiday from writing, & maunder off into the vineyards at Cassis. But I cant: too weak minded; dependent upon L.: & life’s too fixed. So I must dandle my brain, & find a substitute. Tired, after London yesterday. Cant screw either to PH or Roger. Elizabeth Bowen now? A walk? Pick apples? only 11.30—a familiar, but not hopeless, situation. In fact I’m like a teetotum, that’s so weighted it always spins, wherever dropped. Only too sleepy today to spin. Finish after a devilish week end. Richard & Ann here. Talk for 48 hours. A nice couple: I like him. Some body & some brain. Charm & integrity. She helter skelter, adolescent, vigour, but I daresay neurotic. Much younger, more uneven than he. Oh & we went to Tilton & read L.’s play [The Hotel] to the K.s. They gravely approved. M. as intent as a terrier. Very interesting. We like it very much. Suggest the Group Theatre. Off to Cambridge. End of the season. Clive gone already.

Sandbags still in position in B⁠[loomsbur]⁠y. Southampton Row being pulled down. Clerks had bought spade & first aid outfit. John reasonable. Nice to come home to duck. Today the first time without workmen. L. arranging books in the gallery."
1938.10.14,"Two things I mean to do when the long dark evenings come: to write, on the spur of the moment, as now, lots of little poems to go into P.H.: as they may come in handy: to collect, even bind together, my innumerable T.L.S. notes: to consider them as material for some kind of critical book: quotations? comments? ranging all through English lit: as I’ve read it & noted it during the past 20 years.

Now, having made this note, I must in sober earnest write letters; to Ray [Strachey]: to Joan Easdale, who’s marrying Jim Rendel; to Suh about her autobiography. In fact I must clear my table, as L. calls it & does it—before we go on Sunday. No more then here. But at last its a fine day: & head better."
1938.10.20,"52 Tavistock Square.

Only Thursday! It seems 14 days since we left MH. I knew the break would be a jangle; but not that I should feel the mixture of humiliation & dissolution wh. I feel today, after a sleeping draught. And the curious fact is all this is the result of offering to pay Helen Anrep’s overdraught. I thought it wd be 50 it is 150 or 200. So I’ve committed myself again, on the impulse of the moment: just as I’d sworn not to. Cant spend freely. Must write an article. And is it worth it? L. at once says he will go shares. No. But why do I hesitate over this? 1. She disliked 3 Gs. I know its the right thing to do. I dont like talking emotionally (about Roger chiefly [?]). Then I was jangled by the temptation of a week at Cassis. L. very divine—walked in the Sq. I dont think I come altogether badly out of it. I’ve forced myself to work at R. this morning. Theres some taste about it that I dislike. And worrying L. And the sleeping draught heavy on me, like a hand. Yet it is right to give her the money, as she’s doing without a servant. I mean if one cared for R. this is a way to show it—better than buying clothes or another room. So don’t let me vacillate. Only be more careful in future."
1938.10.22,"Decidedly less jangled; though my promise to pay H.’s overdraught still remains: she has not sent me any word tho’, & thus cowardlike I hope I may keep my hoard intact. Yet I’m glad not to have to buy expensive clothes. An odd little kink in my mind, which I cant untwist. I daresay this will make interesting reading to me one of these days, should I write a true memoir. Anyhow, it did slightly bear fruit when Colefax came to see me yesterday. I said I will only dine with you if I may walk. Dressing & driving in a cab destroy my sentence—jerk me fr one consciousness to another. I’ll dine with you to meet the D. of Devonshire as I am. Now this was logical & sensible: making the best of modern conditions as R. has it. She asserts that her ambition is to preserve civilisation. So is my ambition. It boils down to dining with S⁠[ibyl]. in day clothes. Also to bring Isherwood & Auden to dine there. That I dont promise: but why not explore this possibility of seeing the great world from a new angle? I think it fits in with my general scheme at present. Then I can pay Helen: keep my self respect &c. And we’re lunching early to go to Hampton Court, after a long grind—not quite fruitless—at R.—the Broussa scene. I’m interested, though the drudgery is intense—quotes & general outline. But I see it: its the doing the detail in words thats the worry."
1938.10.30,"Words, words, words, so many & so many—That I think is the vocalisation of my little sensation this morning. I am tired of writing. At least its a bad life when for some reason one has an intermittence of feeling. Perhaps this is due to the jerk of 2 days at MH: & then straight back, yesterday, from perfect warmth & summer blue to London, dinner with all the W⁠[oolf]’s at Freda’s Club. This was Lord Spencer’s house. I sat next Martin [Abrahamson] & Harold & said almost exactly what I said a year ago. These reunions are rather like shows of old clothes. Freda & Alice & Sylvia all stouter; & so on. Mrs W. shrivelled, upheld by a new belt.

“Words” refers partly to Vita’s new poem, Solitude. Does it jab on the nerve? Is it only sleek eloquence? The words I found on my lips were “suave & sumptuous”. I suspect there’s a good deal more. But no doubt I’m at an angle, as I say. I dont want reflections on God: nor do I altogether forget her superficial view of 3 Gs: that she never troubled to think out what I meant. This is partly personal; partly not.

Miss Gardiner hauled me out of the Lodge yesterday. The young are reading 3 Gs: it is a revelation. I let her explain. It seemed to explain to us what we’re doing. She gave me Thomas Mann, who does the same. Now Vita never contemplated that quality in 3 Gs.

Nessa away slightly rasps me. I have no circumference; only my inviolable centre: L. to wit. He has been offered £500 by Gollancz for a book on Civn. His play will be tried by the Group. Stephen S. thinks it a roaring comedy & very original.

I should like to be quit of all this: am more & more dissatisfied with modern lit: & the criticism thereof; envy painters; yet suspect that I must grate myself upon people to get my sense of “words” dried up. So dine tomorrow to meet Max [Beerbohm] &c: & C. Isherwood comes too. I think I shall read Chaucer: & En⁠[glis]⁠h poetry concurrently with French prose. But I’m word haunted. The ugliness of the W.s in middle life last night rasped me: & their complete lack of—what? Something I shall find at Sybil’s? I wonder. Fire at Marseilles; Parliament meeting; To the L. out in Dents. CR in Pelican. Asked to write a story for Harpers. Also to give a book to the Ox. Univ. Press. Hugh writes. A great deal on foot. Words words & now roast beef & apple tart. An evening alone."
1938.11.01,"Max like a Cheshire cat. Orbicular. Jowld. Blue eyed. Eyes grow vague. Something like Bruce Richmond—all curves. What he said was, Ive never been in a group. No, not even as a young man. It was a serious fault. When you’re a young man you ought to think Theres only one right way. And I thought—this is very profound, but you maynt realise it—“It takes all sorts to make a world.” I was outside all the groups. Now dear Roger Fry who liked me, was a born leader. No one so “illuminated”. He looked it. Never saw anyone look it so much. I heard him lecture, on the Aesthetics of Art. I was disappointed. He kept on turning the page—turning the page…. Hampstead hasnt yet been spoilt. I stayed at Jack Straw’s Castle some years ago. My wife had been having influenza. And the barmaid, looking over her shoulder said—my wife had had influenza twice—“Quite a greedy one arent you?” Now thats immortal. There’s all the race of barmaids in that. I suppose I’ve been ten times into public houses. George Moore never used his eyes. He never knew what men & women think. He got it all out of books. Ah I was afraid you would remind me of Ave atque Vale. Yes. Thats beautiful. Yes, its true he used his eyes then. Otherwise its like a lovely lake, with no fish in it. The Brook Kerith …

Coulson Kernahan? (I told how CK. stopped me in Hastings. Are you Edith Sitwell? No, Mrs W. And you? Coulson Kernahan.) At this Max gobbled. Instantly said he had known him in Yellow Book days. He wrote God & the Ant. Sold 12 million copies. And a book of reminiscences—How I visited Lord Roberts … The great man rose from his chair. His eyes—were they hazel? were they blue? were they brown?—no they were just soldier’s eyes … And he wrote, Celebrities I have not met—Max Beerbohm. I gave him Ottoline’s ring. “I only knew her superficially—Was she happy. She quarrelled—Eleanor (or whatever Mrs B.’s name is [Florence]: she is drooping; washed out; loose lipped; sympathetic; one finger plastered) & Ottoline quarrelled. Your obituary was lovely. Did he indeed ring you up? Well, how strange people are. And they write, Lady Eglantyne … has raised the standard of heaven …

About his own writing: dear Lytton Strachey said to me: first I write one sentence; then I write another. Thats how I write. And so I go on. But I have a feeling writing ought to be like running through a field. Thats your way. Now how do you go down to your room, after breakfast—what do you feel? I used to look at the clock, & say Oh dear me, its time I began my article…. No, I’ll read the paper first. I never wanted to write. But I used to come home from a dinner party & take my brush & draw caricature after caricature. They seemed to bubble up from here … he pressed his stomach. That was a kind of inspiration, I suppose. What you said in your beautiful essay about me & Charles Lamb was quite true. He was crazy, he had the gift … genius. I’m too like Jack Horner. I pull out my plum. Its too rounded, too perfect … I have a public of about 1500—Oh I’m famous, largely thanks to you, & people of importance at the top like you. I often read over my own work. And I have a habit of reading it through the eyes of people I respect. I often read it as Virginia Woolf would read it—picking out the kind of things you would like. You never do that? Oh you should try it.

Willie Maugham came in: like a dead man whose beard or moustache has grown a little grisly bristle after death. And his lips are drawn back like a dead mans. He has small ferret eyes. A look of suffering & malignity & meanness & suspicion. A mechanical voice as if he had to raise a lever at each word—stiffens talk into something hard cut measured. Talked of Aldous—his conversion. He thinks his soul & Gerald Heard’s soul are one soul. Max said he had been taught by Leonard Huxley at Charterhouse. Poor fellow, so distinguished, so cultivated … they ragged him. And I could picture the interview with the headmaster. I am so glad that you are finding a larger scope for your abilities—getting rid of him. And I could imagine this charming fellow, newly married to a delightful young lady &c &c. Willie M. never imagined in this way. Sat like an animal in a trap: or like a steel trap. And I could not say anything that loosed his dead man’s jaw. He wanted searching analytical statement about Gerald Heard’s character. GH has been very kind to me, he said, as if he needed kindness. But I want to know: do you think he has—I think he wanted to know if he were a genuine person; but I couldn’t fit my mind to his. Then the B⁠[eerbohm]⁠s went; & MB reappeared, in a smart overcoat (he wore double breasted blue suit) carrying a black cane with a white billiard ball on top. “Do you see how careful I was to say Sybil? before I came in, to warn her, lest she might be saying, What an old bore Max has become!”

Isherwood & I met on the doorstep. He is a slip of a wild boy: with quicksilver eyes. Nipped. Jockey like. That young man, said W. Maugham “holds the future of the English novel in his hands.” Very enthusiastic. In spite of Max’s brilliance, & idiosyncrasy, which he completely realises, & does not overstep, this was a surface evening: as I proved, because I found I could not smoke the cigar which I had brought. That was on the deeper level. All kept to the same surface level by Sybil’s hostesscraft. Stories. Compliments. The house: its shell like whites & silvers & greens; its panelling; its old furniture. And Lord Ivor: & Lord de la Warr.

We are going to look at 6 Endsleigh St after lunch, a freehold house, costing £7,500."
1938.11.14,"So many pages, I see about the Colefax party, & none about the incessant stream here. I use my old image. Trying to drink a cup of tea, & having it knocked out of ones hand. Spenders & Joan [Easedale]; then Hugh [Walpole], Spenders, Elizabeth [Bowen] & Sybil. Then Helen (on Saturday, my only day’s solitude) followed by Adrian.

I am a little ruffled: spending my morning writing Biography for America in order to pay off Baba’s debts. So it seems. My £150 has been lent; given I suppose; & I must replace it. I feel I maynt have the chance in a year or two. We never reach the pinnacle where I needn’t make owing to my—shall I say generosity? or impulsiveness? Helen came—oh yes—no doubt she wants the money—was desperate, evidently, if I decided not to give it. So I gave it. Voila qui est fait, as Mme de Sevigne says. To school myself against silly puritanism, I instantly spent £5.10 on a very charming bookcase. And shall buy a dresser this afternoon. But my brain racked by biography wont describe life; or analyse the lending emotions. Some were very happy. I mean, paying the debt to Roger. Then the reaction. Irritation. Then the refugees—They clamour. So I dig my toes in: & on the one hand buy furniture; on the other make money.

A letter from Duncan. Complete bliss at Cassis, has a country life in view, Angelica perfect. So’s the weather today. Jews persecuted, only just over the Channel. Here we feel a faint heat under us, like potatoes frying. But no more than that. I here vow to see no one till Vita on Thursday."
1938.11.15,"I did not buy the dresser. We cannoned into Rose Macaulay, an incredibly shrunk, hair twisted figure, dealing with her car at a garage. She never saw us. I like these unseen visions. Then I walked to Selfridge: so across all the Parks, following two perfect Guardsmen. A soft & remote blue ceiling of sky over the Park. My one quiet evening since Thursday. Read Chaucer: began Lytton Q.E. & Essex [Strachey’s Elizabeth and Essex, 1928] for my article. Ideas popped up, but I want to write fiction, my weeks off, not more hard highroad prose.

Tonight we dine with Clive. Ethel Sands pesters. Fixed for Tuesday fortnight I should say. I am determined not to be a means provider: to have & enjoy things as ends. Otherwise I could go on lending money; earning money in order to lend money; writing books in order to please Nessa & Ha [Margery Fry] & Helen; no I must dig my feet in & do the things I think my own ends. And so left L. & walked across the park: this was an end, not a passage way to this that & the other. What end shall I make this afternoon? Very foggy which obscures the end. Might have gone to Cockfosters.

I shall read Sevigné & Chaucer & 50 Years of a Drs life if it comes from the Library. Many publicity letters. The Cigar quarrel. In⁠[tellectua]⁠l. Liberty appeals & Mrs Moggridge [unidentified]."
1938.11.16,"There are very few mountain summit moments. I mean, looking out at peace from a height. I made this reflection going upstairs. That is symbolical I’m “going upstairs” now, when I write Biography. Shall I have a moment on top? Or when I’ve done Roger? or tonight, in bed, between 2 & 3? They come spasmodically. Often when I was so miserable about The Years.

Viola Tree died last night, of pleurisy: 2 years younger than I am.

I remember the quality of her skin: like an apricot; a few amber coloured hairs. Eyes blistered with paint underneath. A huge Goddess woman, who was also an old drudge; a big boned striding figure; much got up, of late. Last time I saw her at the Gargoyle [Club] Cocktail; when she was in her abundant expansive mood. I never reached any other; yet always liked her. Met her perhaps once a year, about her books. She dined here the night her Castles in Spain came out. And I went to tea in Woburn Sq. & the butter was wrapped in a newspaper. And there was an Italian double bed in the drawing room. She was instinctive; & had the charm of good actress manners; & their Bohemianism, & sentimentality. But I think was a sterling spontaneous mother & daughter; not ambitious; a great hand at life; I suppose harassed for money; & extravagant; & very bold; & courageous—a maker of picturesque surroundings. So strong & large, that she shd. have lived to be 80: yet no doubt undermined that castle, with late hours; drink? I dont know. She could transmit something into words. Her daughter Virginia to be married this week. And think of Viola lying dead—How out of place—unnecessary.

Dinner at Clive’s. Janice lashing out, like a bird that begins to flutter & peck. Wants to be off? Anyhow we all talked: about Jews: about Clive’s lunch party with Willy Maugham & de la Mare: which are the best books for the illiterate: then about being Jews: then about technique: the word broken in the Bible; L. read passages. A confused argument about technique; wh. Janice sided I dont know. Anyhow she spoke up. A symptom of revolt from the elderly? She left when we did. Clive looking down from his dining room window. He leaves Gordon Square in January."
1938.11.18,"Leonard has a rash on his back; decided it was the result of the prostate; sent for Rau; who says no its your new pyjamas; takes a sample; dismisses idea of prostate about wh. he was so positive—& the result of all this is, I was all on edge with Vita yesterday: & still think, if the telephone rings, Oh thats Rau to say the specimen is impure. But there is no message—12.45. And yet my morning has been spoilt. I cant settle to Biography yet intend to finish it by Monday. The old wound of last Januarys anxiety has made me irrational. We are off to MH. on a milky blue day, for this autumn is unparalelled—a summer heat. Vita sensitive about Solitude."
1938.11.22,"I meant to write Reflections on my position as a writer. I dont want to read Dante; have 10 minutes over from rehashing Lappin & Lapinova, a story written I think at Asheham 20 years ago or more: when I was writing Night & Day perhaps.

Thats a long stretch. And apparently I’ve been exalted to a very high position, say about 10 years ago: then was decapitated by W⁠[yndham] Lewis & Miss Stein; am now I think—let me see—out of date, of course; not a patch, with the young, on Morgan; yet wrote The Waves; yet am unlikely to write anything good again; am a secondrate, & likely, I think, to be discarded altogether. I think thats my public reputation at the moment. It is based largely on C. Connolly’s Cocktail criticism: a sheaf of feathers in the wind. How much do I mind? Less than I expected. But then of course, its all less than I realised. I mean, I never thought I was so famous; so dont feel the decapitation. Yet its true that after The Waves, or Flush, Scrutiny I think found me out. W.L. attacked me. I was aware of an active opposition. Yes I used to be praised by the young & attacked by the elderly. 3 Gs. has queered the pitch. For the G.M. Youngs & the Scrutineers both attack that. And my own friends have sent me to Coventry over it. So my position is ambiguous. Undoubtedly Morgan’s reputation is much higher than my own. So is Tom’s. Well? In a way it is a relief. I’m fundamentally, I think, an outsider. I do my best work & feel most braced with my back to the wall. Its an odd feeling though, writing against the current: difficult entirely to disregard the current. Yet of course I shall. And it remains to be seen if there’s anything in P.H. In any case I have my critical brain to fall back on. But how widely I feel outside it all: untrapped by the Morgan communist group. And I know, I think, my faults. This is not the measured criticism of my position I meant to write. I’m not able to go deeply. For heres the usual stir & bother—Nessa back tomorrow, Flossie ill: am I to go Hunting? & so on. A wild wet Sunday [at Rodmell]; a walk to Muggery; no Quentin; alone; & thank heaven, no message whatever from Rau; so all that strain was gratuitous. An odd reflection: how much anguish I wasted last January. Had I only known then that it would be dispersed thus—"
1938.11.24,"Yes & when Nessa came back, whom I so much wanted to see, the old irritation about Helen bubbled up, & I walked all through Finsbury Park this afternoon, telling over & over the story of my loan. I wonder why. Why life suddenly seems empty & endless: & I seem for ever climbing the endless stair, forced; unhelped; unthanked; a mere slave to some harsh—shall I say destiny—or is the word too big for what is probably some superficial reaction; part the old jealousy of Nessa’s children is it? And then oh the bore of writing out a story to make money!"
1938.11.25,"L.’s birthday—58? But I open this, to note, at the foot of the last pessimistic page, in 2 minutes, the fact that pessimism can be routed by getting into the flow: creative writing. A passage in Bio⁠[graph]⁠y. came right. After an incredible empty churning & grinding. Cold tears standing behind my eyes. It came right & I’m floated. So why not, when pessimistic, dandle the brain a little, until it gets into its circuit?

A fine cold day: L.’s birthday."
1938.11.28,"More brain churning to add a passage to L⁠[appin] & L⁠[apinova]. & all my courage needed. Then R.’s letters to his father. I can work my brain. So thats all right. And one of these days I shall be off writing what I like. To Harrow yesterday: sudden fog: shouts; terror; never was so suddenly obliterated. Turned & walked at Hampstead. Dinner at Clive’s. An English Turkey. Duncan flown; argumentative, persistent; chattering against T. E. Lawrence &c. amusing."
1938.12.01,"I think it would be a relief to write a free sentence here, after so much churning. And so much fitting in. Let me count the people only: Angelica, silent & reserved took my free Monday evening. On Tuesday, I went to Ethel Sands. Did my tricks in front of Guy Ridley, little Sinclair & Shaw Taylor: ashen coloured heap of ashes, that house. Fine, silver, suffocating. Sally, a smudge, talked of Baba; then Ann & Richard: Sally stayed till 12.30. On Wednesday, Mary at 4, Richard Hughes at 5: Colefax at 6: went to see the moon at Elizabeth Williamson’s observatory, & did not see it. Tonight Vita. Tomorrow MH. Is it wonderful that I break in upon L. & exclaim we will sell the Press & live in the country? John is making scenes. This adds to the strain. Turns red & gobbles. So whats the point of hoping for a balmy & fruitful future? A very bad season. No sales. Can I afford D⁠[uncan’]⁠s £40 carpet? Regret Helen’s £150: but I’m a little proud that I made myself write the story & the article in two weeks; & started Roger again. But I have lost the scent. Dont feel him real any more. Chafing & drudgery necessary. Shall work at that till April now. And then rest my head."
1938.12.11,"A few scattered notes.

We walked back from 12th Night (disappointing) on a clear cold night. Talked of death in Russell Sqre. L. said he had taught himself not to think about it. 2 or 3 years ago fear of death became an obsession. I said I should not wish to live if he died. But until then found life what? exciting? Yes I think so. He agreed. So we dont think of death. This came from David Cecil’s account of Desmond: who has an idee fixe: his old mothers death; & then cant rouse himself from accusations; how he is war guilty or “we” are: the English presumably.

Very long hours of semi-drudgery on R. The war years. I want to sum up my 3 G. conclusions, had I time or brain before the end of the year.

How horribly the year began! As a detail, I chose a gay cover [for her diary] to counteract what I suspected—L.’s serious illness. All that blown away. The rash is caused possibly by Sally’s hair. Mrs W. has had a heart attack. But her vitality may again pull her over. The Jews obsess her. My private naggery to coin a word for the bone one gnaws at odd moments is Helen taking £150 off me with which to supply sympathy to sympathy addicts. But thats unfair. But then one is unfair at 2 in the morning. This autumn reveals plainly our ‘celebrity’: that is, that we never get a day to ourselves; & attract a constant stream, from all quarters. Political, social, literary. I suppose this is secretly pleasing. I wonder. A month in winter fields will cool me down. Biography writing not much tax on the higher faculties as I perhaps shd. not call my rather doubtful gifts in that line. The young all swarm, even if they criticise. And I’m working in Rose Macaulay, Tom Eliot, Martin Freud, the Robsons & Ethel Smyth—all this week: a hint that I shd. use the morning then for Roger & not scribble, in a hand so worn with writing it hardly writes, any longer."
1938.12.12,"Rather a debauched Sunday evening at Clive’s last night. Was he drunk? He was so quarrelsome & peevish, after dinner. A long tirade against motorists. Suddenly Nessa got quite red & said “This conversation is so foolish we’d better change it”. But Clive wdn’t change it. Every change had its head snapped off. David Cecil derided; Lytton’s books dismissed. I thought of Roger & Lytton & how we used to talk of a Sunday evening. Now all personal gossip & these tedious bickerings.

L. lacerated with his rash. Injections only painful & do no good. He limped round St James Park. Very gloomy today. Fine weather—thats all that can be said in favour of the world & my grind at R. joyless & unprogressive. 2 days rewriting the transition page after 1918."
1938.12.15,"This is hells Black Calcutta hole week.

Monday Angelica. Tuesday Rose. Wednesday lunch Vita to meet Stark: after dinner to William’s to meet von Schuberts; Freud & E. Williamson to dine tonight. Tomorrow E. Bowen & Robson: Cal⁠[edonian]. Market: Ethel Smyth; Saturday Robsons: Sunday Tom—& why?

348 20 money to spend lawfully on myself. Last year I gave away £20 to Nessa; £8 for her chair; £100 to Angelica; bought D.’s picture £30: Q.’s table 5: tiles £10: mirror £15. lent H. 150. Sophie [Farrell] £10. That (roughly counted) makes £348 given or lent, with a philanthropic element; as in the art objects. This I must control. I must continue A.’s 100 & Sophie’s £10. but draw in the other miscellaneous givings. No verbal commissions any more. But how much on dress & pocket money & house furnishing? Charity? And I will forecast my income. H⁠[arper’s]. B⁠[azaar]. (London) “likes” L⁠[appin and]. L⁠[apinova], but wont commit themselves till they hear from Davis. I suspect they wont take it."
1938.12.19,"I will spend the last morning—for tomorrow will be an odious scramble—in summing up the year. True, there are 10 days or so to run; but the liberty of this book allows these—I was going to say liberties, but my meticulous conscience bids me look for another word. That raises some questions; but I leave them; questions about my concern with the art of writing. On the whole the art becomes absorbing—more? no, I think its been absorbing ever since I was a little creature, scribbling a story in the manner of Hawthorne on the green plush sofa in the drawing room at St Ives while the grown ups dined.

The last dinner of the year was to Tom Eliot last night. Physically he is a little muffin faced; sallow & shadowed; but intent (as I am) on the art of writing. His play—Family Reunion?—was the staple of the very bitter cold evening. (The snow is now falling: flakes come through my skylight: I am huddled in my red rain jacket, opportunely given by L.) It has taken him off & on 2 years to write, is an advance upon Murder; in poetry; a new line, with 3 stresses; “I dont seem popular this evening”: “What for do we talk of cancer again” (no: this is not accurate). When the crisis came, his only thought was annoyance that now his play would not be acted. And he hurried up the revision (so David Cecil came to town & divided Melbourne into 2 vols.: so that at least one should be printed).

Tom said the young don’t take art or politics seriously enough. Disappointed in the Auden-Ish⁠[erwoo]⁠d. He has his grandeur. He said that there are flaws in the new play that are congenital, inalterable. I suspect in the department of humour. He defined the different kinds of influence: a subtle, splitting mind: a man of simple integrity, & the artists ingenuous egotism. Dines out & goes to musical teas; reads poems at Londonderry house; has a humorous sardonic gift which mitigates his egotism; & is on the side of authority. A nice old friends evening. And we did not go to Judith’s party.

This year I have worked at 3 Gs; & began, about April 1st, Roger: whom I have brought to the year 1919. I have also written Walpole; Lappin & Lapinova, & the Art of Biography. John says that 2 cabinet ministers are in favour of giving me the OM. The other candidates are Clemence Dane & Dame—the painter who does circuses. So the compliment is not as high as I should like: though its true I was the chosen … I mean, preferred; but its only lunch party gossip at Kenneth Clarks.

The reception of 3 Gs. has been interesting, unexpected—only I’m not sure what I expected. 8,000 sold. Not one of my friends has mentioned it. My wide circle has widened—but I’m altogether in the dark as to the true merits of the book. Is it.. ? No, I wont even formulate qualities; for, its true, no one has yet summed it up. Much less unanimity than about Room of Ones Own. A suspended judgment upon that work then seems fittest. I’ve written too 120 pages of Pointz Hall. I think of making it a 220 page book. A medley. I rush to it for relief after a long pressure of Fry facts. But I think I see a whole somewhere—it was simply seized, one day, about April, as a dangling thread: no notion what page came next. And then they came. To be written for pleasure.

Money I’ve summed up: & good resolutions. We shall find the new window in at MH. And its the coldest day for 5 years. Snow steadily falling. John temperamental. Another boil over on Saturday. A very bad season. Probable loss.

Reading Chaucer & Sevigne & the usual trash books. 2 years more of 52. The new flats going up in Southampton Row. Clive leaving 50. A last message from Ottoline this morning [unexplained]. Deaths this year: Ottoline, Ka. Mrs W. recovering."
1939.01.05,"So I take a new nib, after bringing Roger to the verge of Josette with the old one, & spend my last 5 minutes, this very fine January morning, in writing the first page of the new Year. Last 5 minutes before lunch—how inaugurate this important volume in that time, with this brain? A brain still running in the rut of the last sentence, which last sentence will be re-written a dozen times, too. So the dominant theme is work: Roger: the others the usual Rodmell themes. That is, I’ve let the frost go too far away. We came down 14 or 15 days ago & found all pipes frozen. There was snow for 5 days—bitter cold; wind. We staggered for one hour through the blizzard. Chains were on our wheels. We ground over to Charleston & Tilton on Christmas day. Then, 2 days later, woke to find green grass everywhere. The long spikes of ice that hung down the kitchen window had drops on their noses. They melted. The pipes thawed. Now its a June morning with an east wind. And times up. But the book’s begun anyhow. And perhaps I shall get a clearer head & say 10 minutes tomorrow. To Alciston yesterday, & envied the view & the farmhouse. But L. says “I prefer Monks House” Walked in Firle Park. At sight of that great yellow white mansion, L. said, “I prefer Monks House.” So to lunch."
1939.01.09,"Now that I have brought my brain to the state of an old washerwomans flannel over Roger—Lord the Josette chapter—& its all too detailed, too tied down—I must expand, first on this irresponsible page, & then, for 4 days I swear, before we go back on Sunday, in fiction. Though I’ve ground out most wish to write, even fiction. Rodmell is a grind on the brain: in winter especially. I write 3 solid hours: walk 2: then we read, with intervals for cooking dinner, music, news, till 11.30. I’ve thus read L.’s second volume: very good; full; moulded; subtle; & ever so many packets of R.’s letters; & some Sevigné, Chaucer—& some nonsense books. Weather now broken. Floods & gales; marsh under water. Charleston broken up. Maynard’s father dying.

And that reminds me of 2 obituaries I should have written, had I not been immersed: Jack Hills & Mitz. Mitz was found dead on Boxing day I think: her white old womans face puckered; eyes shut; tail wrapped round her neck. L. buried her in the snow under the wall. Jack died the same day about—no Xmas Eve: & if I had a brain (but havent) I could retell his life; as it affected ours, 30 years ago. The last time I saw him was in the London Library a year ago: grown stout & rosy; I heard his odd stammer: was too shy to speak. He was talking to a lady about a visit they had paid together—a sign of his unknown life. For who he saw, where he lived even had long been lost to me. Yet of all our youthful directors he was the most open minded, least repressive, could best have fitted in with later developments, had we not gone our ways—he to politics & sport, we to Bloomsbury. I remember his address to me in Fitzroy Square after V⁠[anessa]’s marriage on the sexual life of young men. Can they be honourable? I asked—when he said how all male talk was about women; how every young man had his whore. He was amused. I remember the moonlight night at Hindhead: the tramp: the shadows in the garden; Stella & he in the summer house; Thoby shouting at the tramp. Sophie confirms this: the tramp looked in at the kitchen window, where she sat getting a meal for Mr George. And then Stella’s death, one year later, & how he came round & sat with me, & talked in his natural voice. And then those appalling evenings at Painswick, sitting with him in a summer house, after dinner; he grasping my hand in agony: torn asunder—you cant understand—& I fixing a small bush & making it a symbol of agony. Then the long interviews with Nessa: her love; the row with George. “Are they going to get married?”—how he burst in on me & rather brutally told me his suspicion; asked me to speak to her—to warn her. I remember her dignified reproach—“You too?” And father’s sense. “If she wants to I wont interfere.” Then he fell in love, with Elena; with Imogen. A letter from Italy: “Never think that I’ve forgotten Stella, tho’ I’ve loved other women”—& so the dispersal, the very casual meetings; his marriage; & the end. This sketch must serve, since I’m too jaded to write."
1939.01.17,"[52 Tavistock Square]

London on Sunday. Five minutes left of the morning. Yesterday I went to the London Library; thought I’d been there for 40 years; read Tom’s swan song in the Criterion, or rather slipped his condensed meanings over my fluid mind; home & read Delacroix journals; about which I could write: I mean the idea that its among the painters not the writers one finds stability, consolation. This refers to a sentence of his about the profundity of the painter’s meaning; & how a writer always superficialises.

I wish I could distill some of my thoughts about “the situation” into nuggets. The Spanish war is being won yesterday today tomorrow by Franco. I dreamt of Julian. A sniping [?] article on him “The limitations of Bloomsbury” by Janet Adam Smith. She advises life in a mining village as a remedy: what is her practice? This represents a vein of thought that I may work out. Igor [Anrep, Helens son] has bought a motor car—out of my £150? Another vein of thought with which I struggle. The purification of the soul. This is a fact, however: my struggle. Today—dreary wet—I may go to Mathew Smith’s pictures; or may not. John comes. Question of our relations with John.

At Clive’s on Sunday. A good discussion of painting & music. Janice gave tongue. Angelica sang a song. L. talked. So did Nessa.

I’m taking 4 days holiday from Roger, writing P⁠[ointz] H⁠[all], the Barn scene. I’ve learnt something from The Years—just translated into French.

Now the clock strikes one."
1939.01.18,"It is undoubtedly a great freshener to have my story [Lappin and Lapinova] taken by Harper’s. I heard this morning. A beautiful story, enchanted to have it. 600 dollars made then. Therefore I am paying off Helen’s money, as I said I would. But the encouragement, I must note, by way of ruffling my theories that one should do without encouragement, is a warmer, a reviver. I cant deny it. I was, perhaps partly on that account, in full flood this morning with P.H. I think I have got at a more direct method of summarising relations; & then the poems (in metre) run off the prose lyric vein, which, as I agree with Roger, I overdo. That was by the way the best criticism I’ve had for a long time: that I poetise my inanimate scenes, stress my personality; dont let the meaning emerge from the matière—Certainly I owed Roger

I went to Her⁠[t]⁠ford House in the yellow rain yesterday & saw Bodington and Bumalfacco—no thats not the name—a little bit of verification for the book to which I must turn tomorrow. Next pages are about R.’s politics. Now dont, because [Janet] Adam Smith gibes, apologise, for she’s not worth a nail on Roger’s toe.

John to tea—depressed. He & L. never alluded to their exchange of abuse. But I thought him rather worn down. I am not yet up in London politics. One of our lulls. We are still away to our friends; but I must see Mela Spira the refugee Austrian Jewess; & today Mrs Woolf—the blanks will fill. I am going walking & adventuring going to see pictures of an afternoon; & often come face to face, after tea, at odd moments, with the idea of death & age. Why not change the idea of death into an exciting experience?—as one did marriage in youth? Age is baffled today by my creative gift—still a bubble. And then the steady passion with which I now read … A rainy day. Rain real wet drops: white splashing from the road. I must somehow ease my way back into Roger—shut PH firmly; my mind full of figures—Isa in the greenhouse—to be put in their boxes."
1939.01.22,"And my article on Biography has been taken by the Atlantic. Thus in a little over 2 weeks I made something (over) round about £160. Helen paid off. At the same time, the Spiras, a battered couple lodging in Hampstead, came to tea [on 20 January]; implore us to get her a permit to teach German; both in the depths of a kind of shifty unformulated despair: driven from Gratz with a bundle of old pictures only which no one will buy. Also, war is coming close again, just as in September. L. thinks the next screw will be in March. PM to broadcast today on National service. We are warned to buy extra food & see to our supply of water. Desmond came to lunch, outstayed the Spiras, left at 8. Suddenly his face falls into the fixity of a tragic old man’s despair. Then twinkles. Always thinking. “My chief delight is in the uprush of thought to the brain. No I dont care whether Rachel has a child or not. I live in ideas. And what a world to bring children into” (another fixed moment). A discussion about readers & writers criticism. How to uphold the standard; & yet have a sense of direction. That is to encourage St Denis even if the particular play is bad. How the cultivated always kill their own offspring i.e. the Omega, or the Life & Letters: partly snobbery. “I’ve too high a standard.” He is off to America to net £200 by lecturing. I look at my letters from editors. Its odd [text ends]"
1939.01.24,"On the placards this afternoon: Franco at the gate of Barcelona: Measures for defence. This refers to our new voluntary service. The one is the cause of the other. Yesterday 300 bullets were found thrown into the bushes the other side of Tavistock Square. A reporter came to ask if Mr Woolf could give any information. One of the Irish rebels lodges in Tavistock Place or Court. These are notes I scribble hastily, while L. (exacerbated by the itch again) goes to the Cocktail at the BBC. I to read over Helen’s letters, on a fine spring day, the eve of my 57th birthday. And on the bus coming back from the Flower Show I described my new ‘novel’: & we planned the books we shd. write, if we could live another 30 years."
1939.01.29,"Yes, Barcelona has fallen: Hitler speaks tomorrow; the next dress rehearsal begins: I have seen Marie Stopes, Princesse de Polignac, Philip & Pippin, & Dr Freud in the last 3 days, also had Tom to dinner & to the Stephens’ party.

Dr Freud gave me a narcissus. Was sitting in a great library with little statues at a large scrupulously tidy shiny table. We like patients on chairs. A screwed up shrunk very old man: with a monkeys light eyes, paralysed spasmodic movements, inarticulate: but alert. On Hitler. Generation before the poison will be worked out. About his books. Fame? I was infamous rather than famous, didnt make £50 by his first book. Difficult talk. An interview. Daughter & Martin helped. Immense potential, I mean an old fire now flickering. When we left he took up the stand What are you going to do? The English—war."
1939.01.30,"Freud said It would have been worse if you had not won the war. I said we often felt guilty—if we had failed, perhaps Hitler would have not been. No, he said, with great emphasis; he would have been infinitely worse. They considered leaving for 3 months; made up their minds in 24 hours. Very alert at L.’s mention of the case when the Judge decreed that the criminal should read 20 of Freud’s books. Adrian says the Pss Bonaparte gave him this great silent solid Hampstead mansion. “But we dont like it as well as our flat in Vienna” said Anna. A certain strain: all refugees are like gulls with their beaks out for possible crumbs. Martin & his novel; she on her book. The strain on us too of being benefactors.

A⁠[drian]’s party varied & no doubt successful. The young danced till 3. Bobo in crimson velvet, Tom in Lytton’s beard with a brown pop eye: Janice in a great nose; Clive ebullient, dancing with Bobo; repairing that old breach. Duncan a blond French prince: Ann almost naked, very distinguished, lovely; aloof; fierce; Richard urbane & inscrutable: always the same, Angelica said; Molly oldish; Rachel in a red shawl, about to bear a Cecil; David chirping about his book [The Young Melbourne], out on Thursday; attacked, liked, disliked; refused by USA & Book Society &c. And the usual bobbing corks on the waves—dullards hoping to get into touch with someone or thing & approaching & driven off & then attaching themselves: Portia Holman, the Enfields. A kind of liberation caused by wearing a mask, tipsiness & abandonment at not being one’s usual self. Tom expanding in the lights & stir, much as I do.

Last night Yeats’ death announced. That great thick long jowled poet, whom I met last at Ottoline’s. Dotty will fall from her high estate; but I try to cultivate sympathy rather than satire. And we are all on tiptoe, waiting Hitler’s speech tonight."
1939.01.31,"A very sensible day yesterday. Saw no one. Took the bus to Southwark Bridge. Walked along Thames Street; saw a flight of steps down to the river. I climbed down—a rope at the bottom. Found the strand of the Thames, under the warehouses—strewn with stones, bits of wire, slippery; ships lying off [?] the Bridge (Southwark?—no, the one next to Tower Bridge [London Bridge]). Very slippery; warehouse walls crusted, weedy, worn. The river must cover them at high tide. It was now low. People on the Bridge stared. Difficult walking. A rat haunted, riverine place, great chains, wooden pillars, green slime, bricks corroded, a button hook thrown up by the tide. A bitter cold wind. Thought of the refugees from Barcelona walking 40 miles, one with a baby in a parcel. So to Tower. Made a circuit: discovered St Olave’s Hart Street: Pepys Church; too cold to explore; wandered about Fenchurch alleys, Billingsgate; walked through Leadenhall Market; thought of Thoby buying the wild geese; saw a golden pheasant; so back by omnibus; the street & shops the product of this factory world; tried to buy Wells (Country of the Blind) praised by Tom t’other night; failed; so home; left the kettle on; it blew out its connection; read Michelet; wrote to Desmond about his poetess; L. out at Fabians; played gramophone; listened to Our Masters Voice, Hitler less truculent than expected; read MSS; read The Magnificent Rothschilds; & so to bed.

My head has now protested once more against Roger & facts; so to humour it, I wrote the old Henry Taylor telescope story thats been humming in my mind these 10 years; & have a feeling of life & activity again. Put off Eth Bowen & Sean O’Faolain this afternoon, we go to Mrs Woolf instead: & now, as usual, lunch."
1939.02.09,"Too tired even to fold up Nessa’s Berlin letters [to Roger Fry, 1929]. This tiredness was bred of 8 hours incessant talk after four days incessant sun. That was our 4 days at MH. So people accumulate. Eth Bowen, Sean O’Faolain, Busch concert.

Looking at my old Greek diary I was led to speculate. I extract only this: that I won’t budge from the scheme there (1932) laid down for treating decline of fame. To accept; then ignore; & always venture further. Obviously there are no limits unless one submits. Always shave off the expected, dictated attitude; & find whats under it. But I cant even write this plain. And Molly … But we go to Crufts dog show: fine again."
1939.02.17,"Jangled with talk—talk to David [Cecil] from 4 to 5; then to Katie Lewis; the Hambourgs, talk; home, & Raymond, Anna Freud, the Chilvers talk till 12.30—9 hours solid, frothy, talk, varied by buying Michelet at Nutts, & the Country of the Blind. A hammer & a drill this morning exacerbate still further: they’re pulling down T⁠[avistock]. S⁠[quare]. & building offices. So out in the brisk cold to buy note books. I’m starting my grand tour of literature. That is I’m going to write a book of discovery, reading as one pulls a string out; & must follow my trail through Sevigne Michelet Somerset Maugham &c. Thats the idea; encouraged by that vast marsupial Margery Strachey, who implored me to do criticism: as indeed I’ve long wanted. David grows friendlier: Raymond—oh what a little bank clerk, snub, common, he’s grown; hard as nails, & smug, with a new sawing motion with his hands, & none of the old flutter & sweetness. Severe is your toll, oh age. And I too shrivelled, & was very very old. Rachel waiting her child."
1939.02.28,"It is unfortunate, for truths sake, that I never write here except when jangled with talk. I only record the dumps & the dismals, & them very barely. A holiday from Roger. And one day’s happiness with P.H. Then too many parcels; books coming out; & a head numb at the back. As usual, when I’m prone, all the gnats settle. The usual ones: I neednt specify. I have to ‘speak’ to polytechnics; & engagements multiply. Innumerable refugees to add to the tangle. There—I’ve recorded them when I said I wouldnt. Harold [Woolf] upstairs talking, about refugees, to L. I go in, out of courtesy. He is doing a job for me.

Morgan to lunch yesterday. Much argument: communism defined, also his duties on the Libel Commission: also gossip about Peter & Prudence [Lucas]; she mad. Nessa after dinner. My old thorn about Helen rankles. Oh she’ll never repay you. Lives as usual. Saxon 20 minutes on the phone. Will I lunch with Graham Harris. Odd change into a deliberate old man’s voice. Add to this my petty jealousies. All the same I think I can stamp it out, literally, by walking this afternoon. Plenty of things to see; neednt buy clothes; & sleep over a book. So shall be sane tomorrow. If it were not 12.15 I would walk now. Only it pours. So I will read poetry quietly, I think—having Shelley down here with me.

I have just read [Shelley’s] Mont Blanc, but cant make it “compose”: clouds perpetually over lapping. If a new poem, what should I say? I think a great idea somewhere; but the language so nebulous, or rather words overlapping, like ripples, each effacing the other, partly: & a general confusion results.

Yesterday, Franco was recognised. And Julian killed for this. Nessa though I suppose making herself live: succeeding: very busy."
1939.03.03,"Whats the origin of the expression A flea in his ear?—thats what I’ve just written: & must—(12.15) switch from that to describe yesterday, Thursday: a very long day, but on the whole successfully accomplished. Not at all a nice morning, & worried by my speech, so I walked. And bought some frilling; & then off we went to the Polytechnic; & met a little brown faced supple man in corduroys; inspected a wall of illustrations to O⁠[rlando]. & then in came, say 50 art students: blouses, shirts; nimble, young, inquisitive; stood up, & not very nervously spoke, improving, colloquially. Then L. gave his views; as a publisher. And that was a great success—very valuable indeed, said the professor: & asked him to start again, which he did. No it wasnt formidable. It was rather cheerful. And free & easy. Better much than Oxford & Cambridge: which reminds me that Liverpool today offered me a Doctor’s Degree; which I refused. Then they gave us a specimen book of rather too artistic printing; & then we got off. And I cooled myself with Chaucer. Then to dine at the studio, & a long, but on the whole, admirable & agreeable, Thursday evening. Rogers: 2 fat beavers, identical; artists; Spenders; Inez improving, independent sharp; Tangye Lean, the man with the absurd name who writes in the N. Chronicle; & Dermod MacCarthy; & L. in from The Cranium. I was pleased, vanitously, to find that Inez thinks me a poet-novelist, not a fraud; & T.L. also liked something or other. So we talked shop. The novel. They both incubate novels. He tears up. She has her’s in a drawer. And my jadedness thawed. So that I’ve written several pages of P.H. although Miss Compton Burnett is praised.

Must face the end of Roger, perhaps at MH. this week end. A very fine June blue day at top of the skylight. But I meant to say that Nessa’s conduct of these parties seemed to me admirable; & once she laughed, & laughed & laughed; trying to describe the prevalence of ‘stuff”. I laughed too. Then we discussed tin: iron; & D⁠[ermod]. who has his vein of queer humour, told us how Raymond Abbott said that organ pipes are pure tin. Mrs Rogers described the making of felt: & so on. Very easy, & sensible, & sympathetic. A great many parties in the offing. We have the materials for happiness again. A new Pope elected. A lull in the shindy. Poor Spira’s pictures all frauds. & a Labour P. meeting tonight."
1939.03.11,"Yesterday, that is Friday 10th, I set the last word to the first sketch of Roger. And now I have to begin—well not even to begin, but to revise & revise. A terrible grind to come: & innumerable doubts, of myself as biographer: of the possibility of doing it at all: all the same I’ve carried through to the end; & may allow myself one moments mild gratification. There are the facts more or less extracted. And I’ve no time to go into all the innumerable horrors. There may be a flick of life in it—or is it all dust & ashes?

A day in bed at MH: such a rush with the meeting, & dining at C⁠[harleston]. & then back to the burglary. I heard the burglar laugh as he slammed the door taking our £6 in a cashbox. We thought it was John. Then the Great Psycho Analysts dinner on a wild wet night: Adrian late: dinner at 9 till 12.30. Speeches of a vacancy & verbosity incredible. Lord de la Warr rambling jocosely. And gossip with Duncan & Adrian; the rest of our table sit in unmitigable gloom. Poor Mrs so & so—Meynell & Money Kyrle dead silent: food profuse, snatched, uncharacteristic. Mary Hutch: Rebecca West: & set upon & committed to ask to dinner Mrs Klein.

Then a cocktail at John’s; Rosamond & her new fancy, little self conscious G. Rees, underbred, intelligent; & our German von—something. I shall call you Renny said L. And I dont know why I agreed to lunch with Diana Cooper to meet Ethel Smyth on the spur of the moment—why am I so impulsive? Why am I so old, so ugly, so—& cant write. And the Spender grandmother on Sunday; but alone today."
1939.03.16,"Jack [Hills] I see in this mornings paper left £3,000 only. I see too that Hitler has marched into Prague. This, says the PM. “is not in the spirit of the Munich meeting”. My comment anyhow is superfluous. We sit & watch. Yesterday in Bond Street where I finally did lay out £10 on clothes, I saw a crowd round a car, & on the back seat was a Cheetah with a chain round his loins. I also found a presentation copy of Tom’s Family Reunion; & sucked no pleasure from the first pages. Yet I enjoyed Chaucer, Michelet & Me. de Sevigné. I reserve judgment. The night before Mrs Klein dined—the backwash of my P⁠[sycho]. A⁠[nalysts’]. party—unrecorded? A woman of character & force & some submerged—how shall I say—not craft, but subtlety: something working underground. A pull, a twist, like an undertow: menacing. A bluff grey haired lady, with large bright imaginative eyes.

It was on the tip of my pen—only I had to write—to re-write Roger—to record, in brief form, Lunch with Lady Diana Cooper costs 3/6. Yes, for some impulse of my own, I said I would lunch to meet old Ethel. Old Ethel very deaf. So as to impress the aristocracy who aren’t ever impressed, I took a 1/- cab from Hyde Pk Corner: & Chapel Street was only one step down the road. Curious, the feebleness of the aristocracy in the eye line. Diana has inherited a vast house—sat in a drawing room like the floor of a shop: was furnishing—Chin⁠[t]⁠zes piled up. A glass room, looking on to the D. of Westminster’s great wall—he has a private tennis court. Dishevelled creepers hang down. This great house is so timidly faced. The tinted mask of the late Duchess in a glass case. Rex Whistler discreet amusing fakes of 18th Century decoration—all diluted, reminiscent. And then Duff’s great library, that might have done for Lord Acton or Lord Macaulay—here Rex again at work, fabricating 18th Century. Praise of Sargent. Praise of the late Duchesses tomb at the Tate. The usual space & simplicity. Many little dishes. Many concoctions. But empty & full of unsaturated possessions. “I dont like possessions” said D. She has a bedroom like a shop again. On the table a 6d Penguin. Rooms for Madame de Maintenon, Montespan &c. Only Diana, all niceness, goodness, with that free sweep that I like in the aristocracy: putting on Ethel’s 3 cornered hat (wh. became her) as if they were free, but had nowhere to go. Talk trumpeted, emphatic, difficult, about Maurice Baring. Little rough haired boy came in. So I drove Ethel to Waterloo & paid 2/6 & was then too cold in my finery to walk, so home. Refused lunch with Harry [Stephen] at the Athenaeum.

I’m thinking of a critical book. Suppose I used the diary form? Would this make one free to go from book to book—or wd it be too personal? I might take some fribble, like Peter Opie: so to Sevigne &c. But I must let it simmer.

A blessed space of quiet today—tea with Nessa; then alone tonight; MH. this weekend, & my new green linen waterproof. L.’s back improving. Rau talks of an allergic doctor, who discovers sensibilities; but Rau does not ring up."
1939.03.22,"Tom sent me his play, Family Reunion. No, it dont do. I read it over the week end. It starts theories. But no … You see the experiment with stylised chatter isnt successful. He’s a lyric not a dramatic. But here theres no free lyricism, is caught back by the character: has no power to embody: as stiff as pokers. And the chief poker is Tom: but cant speak out. A cold upright poker. And the Fates behind the drawing room curtain. A clever beginning, & some ideas; but they spin out: & nothing grips: all mist—a failure: a proof hes not a dramatist. A monologist. This is stated very politely by the papers this morning. The News not so politely. We go on Thursday. I’m of course for reasons I can’t go into selfishly relieved: why? Had it been a success would it have somehow sealed—my ideas? does this failure confirm a new idea of mine—that I’m evolving in PH about the drama? Or is it jealousy? & then theres L.’s play. A mixture of motives …

Very fine at the moment; & alone; & confronted with a dress maker; & L. all rash. Rau says it will go in time. Reading Eddie Marsh. Finished the 18th cent scene in PH. Odd how freely & happily I dash that off. Roger put aside. No, I cant write here. Politics lulled: but Kingsley vocal on the phone. An account of Ly Astor’s lunch party."
1939.03.29,"There can be no doubt that Tom knew that his play was a failure. He was very yellow & heavy lidded. We talked about his cold, & I noted that he said his lectures, on Church & State, were “very bad”, a proof, I think, that all his work now seems so. But the evening was oddly successful. Kingsley Martin invited himself, & gave Ann & Sally their modicum of politics; otherwise literature wd have been too ascendant. Then Mr Ellis St Joseph, also self-invited, came. And paid out elaborate, yet oddly interesting, stories: about smoking hashish—how he was given for 10/- amber cigarettes wh. he supposed to be drugged; & puffed in & out, with Oliver Bell on the next bed. And they were only scented. An intricate, pompous, yet interesting young man. And they stayed till 12.30. Hence I’m tired in the head, & cant tackle anything. Think of walking, to prepare for Hugh. A silly idea, having him alone; but I must brisk up something, not sit dreaming here, or my head will ache. KM. privately told L. that German aeroplanes have been flying over London.

Madrid surrendered. KM. says war is inevitable."
1939.03.30,"No, it was a good idea having Hugh alone. He gave me a full account of his sexual life, of which I retain these facts. He only loves men who dont love men. Tried to drown himself once over Melchior. Jumped into a river; stuck in mud; seized a carving knife; saw himself in the glass; all became absurd, reconciliation. Told me too of the Baths at the Elephant & Castle. How the men go there: saw Ld C⁠[name omitted] naked: saw Ld B⁠[name omitted] in the act with a boy; later at the Beefsteak all medals. Has had a married life with Harold for 15 years without intercourse. All this piles up a rich life of wh. I have no knowledge: & he cant use it in his novels. They are therefore about lives he hasnt lived wh. explains their badness. Hasnt the courage to write about his real life. Would shock people he likes. Told me how he had had a father & son simultaneously. Copulation removes barriers. Class barriers fade. Lives at Hampstead with Harold’s family & friends completely naturally. All this is a great deal better than his literary talk. It led me to compare experience with thought. Apostles with phenomenons. He’s been at Rome writing daily articles for Hearst papers. We couldn’t do this. Started making 2 or 3000 a year in 1912. Has supported Melchior & others. Saw, at any rate, another Hugh. Odd that he’s never felt any feeling for women; but his sister is a suppressed Lesbian; & his brother entirely without sex—a schoolmaster. This lasted from 4.30 to 7.30; without a break. And I liked him & enjoyed it, tho’ crushed in the head.

I went to Highgate in the morning; saw the Whittington Stone & met 2 old women on Parliament Hill: each wore a cap of Turkish embroidery on her white straggly hair: very poor unkempt; big boots; black wrinkled stockings & a dog. One said Now if you dont come Peter I shall run away … they were hobbling. Curious vision of their extreme poverty, decrepitude, & the place played in their lives by Peter. How they fed him; & were identical—.. Still brain compressed: Memoir tonight. Molly’s operation over, apparently successful. Desmond with a bad cold; Clive to read. So thats all, & I’m fiddling again with Roger."
1939.03.31,"Yes I made a phrase last night about bearing the panoply of life, & being glad to lay it down. I wonder if its true. After a worried domestic day; then L. had a temperature & went to bed; the Memoir Club was imminent. I felt I was bearing up the panoply of life & wd be glad to let it sink. I said to myself, Remember, this is the description of age coming. I’m on the qui vive to describe age: to note it. I often think of things in this way, but forget them. And as L. is normal & up & as its a fine morning, I’m not conscious of holding up my panoply, only distracted rather & cant settle in but must do R.’s Cambridge letters.

Clive read, truculently, with some motive I guess at the back of him, about R., amusing stories—“The old creature was lying on a camp bed reading with a candle beside him” this is the only touch I need to remember, at Charleston, at 1.30 in the morning. Said R. grew less magnanimous with age: reference to the NS. review, I expect. Nessa silent, disagreeing. Desmond did not come. Rang up. A rather scattered meeting."
1939.04.11,"How much identity, to use my own private slang, is needed to surmount a little hillock: for instance, Lydia on Lappin & Lapinova yesterday at Tilton; & Tilton’s comfort, & quiet; all seem to make it harder for me to get on with revising Roger. Revising Roger at the rate of 2 weeks to a chapter will take me 3 months. Then there’s the war. The finest Easter possible has this purple background. We wait like obedient children to hear what we shall be told when Parliament meets on Thursday. At Tilton we talked first medicine; Maynard’s drastic cure by Plesch; then politics; five minutes left for Tom’s play. Every day, save 2, something’s turned up. Private peace is not accessible. Miss Robins tomorrow. Then Charleston. Then L.P. here. Maynard, even Maynard, cant find much that’s hopeful now that Italy has nipped off Albania save that theres a unity of hatred. The men women children dogs &c. are solid for war if war comes. But privately—how one rockets between private & public—his eyes are bluer, his skin pinker, & he can walk without pain. Lydia has devoted herself to the treatment. They think Nessa suppresses Clive—wont have things out. Never will have anything out. But the⁠[n] L⁠[ydia]. is always on husbands side—a serf like spirit, natural in the circumstances. My allegiance is to N. & D. as usual: but I like all my friends—though not the taste of Tilton.

Roasting hot: birds a chirp: butterflies.

I am reading Dickens; by way of a refresher. How he lives; not writes: both a virtue & a fault. Like seeing something emerge; without containing mind. Yet the accuracy & even sometimes the penetration—into Miss Squeers & Miss Price & the farmer [in Nicholas Nickleby] for example—remarkable. I cant dip my critical mind, even if I try to. Then I’m reading Sevigné, professionally for that quick amalgamation of books that I intend. In future, I’m to write quick, intense, short books, & never be tied down. This is the way to keep off the settling down & refrigeration of old age. And to flout all preconceived theories—For more & more I doubt if enough is known to sketch even probable lines, all too emphatic & conventional.

Maurice, the last of the Ll. Davies brothers is dead; & Margaret lives—lives too carefully of life, I used to feel. Why drag on, always measuring & testing one’s little bit of strength & setting it easy tasks so as to accumulate years?

Also I’m reading Rochefoucauld. Thats the real point of my little Brown book—that it makes me read—with a pen—following the scent: & read the good books; not the slither of MSS & the stridency of the young chawking—the word expresses callow bills agape & chattering—for sympathy. Chaucer I take at need. So if I had any time—but perhaps next week will be more solitudinous—I should, if it weren’t for the war—glide my way up & up in to that exciting layer so rarely lived in: where my mind works so quick it seems asleep; like the aeroplane propellers. But I must retype the last Clifton passage; & so be quit for tomorrow & clear the decks for Cambridge. Rather good, I expect it is: condensed & moulded."
1939.04.13,"Two days of influenza after that, mild but sucking one’s head as usual, so I’m out here this morning only to drone my way through a few Roger letters.

I finished my first 40 pages—childhood &c—well under the week; but then they were largely autobiography. Now politics impend. Cham⁠[berlai]⁠n’s statement in the House today. War I suppose not tomorrow, but nearer. Charleston to tea today. L. went to Brighton yesterday, & had a long talk with Miss Robins in bed, which was interesting, so I’m sorry I missed it, yet glad of solitude, such as it is here. If I could only embed myself for 10 days … I read about 100 pages of Dickens yesterday, & see something vague about the drama & fiction: how the emphasis, the caricature of these innumerable scenes, forever forming character, descend from the stage. Literature—that is the shading, suggesting, as of Henry James, hardly used. All bold & coloured. Rather monotonous, yet so abundant, so creative: yes: but not highly creative: not suggestive. Everything laid on the table. Nothing to engender in solitude. Thats why its so rapid & attractive: nothing to make one put the book down & think. But these are influenza musings; & I’m so muddled I shall take Sir Edward [Fry’s letters] into the house & extract him over the fire. Weather now blackening a little, after 4 days full summer heat—over 70. A Comma butterfly, sunning on the wall. L.’s rash improving. We live on macaroni.

Note: Lydia’s hostility to all married women."
1939.04.15,"Its odd what extreme depression a little influenza & a cold in head produces. Happily I’m interested in depression; & make myself play a game of assembling the fractured pieces—I mean I light a fire, & somehow dandle myself over it. Cooking is helpful. Oh but I was very down & dismal yesterday. And then noises & houses abuilding oppress: & there’s always our dear old war—now postponed for a month. Sneezing & blowing is better than incubating germs.

I’ve done rather well at Roger considering: I dont think I shall take 2 weeks over each chapter. And its rather amusing—dealing drastically with this years drudgery. I think I see how it shapes: & my compiling method was a good one. Perhaps its too like a novel. I dont bother. No letters; no news; & my head too stupid for reading. L. galloping through his book [Barbarians at the Gate]. I should like a holiday—a few days in France—or a run through the Cotswolds.

But considering how many things I have that I like—whats odd—(I’m always beginning like this) is the severance that war seems to bring: everything becomes meaningless: cant plan: then there comes too the community feeling: all England thinking the same thing—this horror of war—at the same moment. Never felt it so strong before. Then the lull & one lapses again into private separation—

But I must order macaroni from London."
1939.04.26,"[52 Tavistock Square]

I’ve done a ¼—100 pages of Roger—well I shall have by tomorrow. As there are 400 pages, & one hundred takes 3 weeks (oh but I was interrupted)—it will take 9 weeks to finish. Yes, I ought to have finished it by the end of July—only we may go away. Say August. And have it all typed in September…. Well—then it will be out this time next year. And I shall be free in August—What a grind it is; & I suppose of little interest except to six or seven people. And I shall be abused."
1939.04.28,"Very much screwed in the brain by trying to get Roger’s marriage chapter into shape; & also warmed by L. saying last night that he was fonder of me than I of him. A discussion as to which would mind the other’s death most. He said he depended more upon our common life than I did. He gave the garden as an instance. He said I lived more in a world of my own. I go for long walks alone. So we argued. I was very happy to think I was so much needed. Its strange how seldom one feels this: yet ‘life in common’ is an immense reality. For instance, I cant go to The Wreckers tonight with Ethel Smyth because: 1. I have a little temperature: 2: (& more serious) I’d rather stay at home with L. Its no use fighting against this. Its one of the facts.

Oh such a dismal tea with Mrs W. yesterday. She is completely lifeless—like an old weed on a rock. And always recurring to the complaints. That was how, by the way, we came to discuss our deaths. L. said he hoped he would predecease me. Her lonely old age is so intolerable. But its lonely, he said, because she has adopted an unreal attitude. Lived in a sentim⁠[ent]⁠al make believe. Sees herself as the adored matriarch, & forces the children to adopt her attitude. Hence the unreality of all relations. This obsession of hers has also shut her off from all other interests: doesn’t care for any impersonal thing—art, music, books. Wont have a companion or reader; must depend on her sons. Constant innuendoes therefore about the goodness of Herbert & Harold; inference that L. neglects her; hints that I have taken him away from his family; absorbed him in mine. So in that crowded pink hot room we sat for 2 hours trying to beat up subjects for conversation. And there were awful silences, & our heads filled with wool; & all was dusty, dreary, old, & hopeless. Yet she followed us out on to the stair & made L. swear that she looks better—“Sure Len? Sure I look better?” as if she still clings hard to life & cant be removed. So to walk in the hail in Ken. Gardens; & see the cherry trees livid & lurid in the yellow storm haze. Very cold winter spring."
1939.04.29,"But what are the interesting things? I’m thinking of what I should like to read here in 10 years time. And I’m all at sea. Perhaps literal facts. The annal, not the novel. Yesterday I went out in a fur coat, for it was bitter cold, to walk in London. I stopped by the Savoy Church: there were photographers. Soon the Bride arrived. The car glided on⁠[;] there were too many cars behind. Mother & small page arrived: 2 girls in absurd little boat hats. They helped the Bride with her veil. “Can you get it over my bouquet?” she asked—very gay; rather red; very slim. Husband & best man waiting in grey trousers & cutaway coats. Old sitters in the sun watching. Camera men. A little procession—rather skimpy & cold & not very rich I thought. The old man—my age—had shabby boots. Shaven, brushed, red, thin. They are Mr Sholto Douglas Barnes, & Miss Marjorie Berkeley, daughter of a deceased ICS Colonel—so I learn today. Then I walked along the Embankment, up into the fur quarter behind Blackfriars. Men in white coats aparelled in silver fur skins. A smell of fur. Found some old City Company houses. One the Inn Keepers Company. Also a green plant bursting out of a factory. Also one of the usual 18th Century mansions tucked away. So into Cannon St. Bought a paper with Hitler’s speech. Read it on top of Bus. Inconclusive—cut up in Stop Press. Everyone reading it—even newspaper sellers, a great proof of interest. So to Kingsway. Bought some folders. Failed to buy a guide to Cotswolds. L. had 4 gents to discuss Sir John Maynard’s memo. Read Chaucer. Enjoyed it. Was warm & happy not to go to Sadlers Wells. Nessa rang up. Bed."
1939.05.01,"A bad morning, because I’m dried up about Roger. I’m determined tho’ to plod through & make a good job, not a work of art. Thats the only way. To force myself on—& yes to relax with a [indecipherable] fiction: & then a few days in the Cotswolds. But there’s no blinking the fact that it is drudgery & must be; & I must go through with it. My hand, as I see, wont write."
1939.05.14,"That last sentence might be repeated. Its a fortnight I see since I had my few minutes margin between Roger & lunch. And thus I need not repeat the fact that my head is a tight wound ball of string. To unwind it, I lie on my Heal chair bed & doze of an evening. But the noise worries me. The 2 houses next door are down; we are shored up. There are patches of wall paper where there used to be hotel bedrooms. Thus the Southampton Row traffic gets at me; & I long for 37 Mecklenburgh Sq: but doubt if we shall get it. Pritchard is negotiating with the Bedfords. A talk about the future with John. He is harassed by the lean year. Cant live in London on £500 minus his mothers interest &c. 37 is a large seeming & oh so quiet house, where I could sleep anywhere. But it dont do to dwell on it. & there would be the horror of the move in August.

Day Lewis came one day; thrust in on the wake of Elizabeth. A stocky sturdy man. truculent, a little like Muggins 40 yrs ago, as I think George called Malcolm Macnaghten. “Priestley lolling on the beach” was should it be lōl ling or lolling? discussed. I made him laugh by repeating that word. I wish I could repeat more words. Boswell did it. Could I turn B. at my age? “I’m doing films for the gas people … I live a purely country life. A rather too arty home. Devonshire.” I infer some rupture with the Bugger Boys.

Boswell at Sissinghurst. Gwen walking through the Bluebell woods, speaking of her youth—a little to justify herself. Had been advertiser to a scent shop, had done welfare work. Her daughter Jiccy meets a prostitute outside the Berkeley whom she has deliv⁠[er]⁠ed. “Must just speak to Bessy” she says to the youth who’s treating her—“Its her beat.” G. a little shocked. And I liked the soft cream & yellow flowers on the sunny grass & the bend stooping like a picture. And the thread of bright blue bells: & Vita in her breeches.

We are going to Brittany by the way after Whitsun. A whole 2 weeks rambling. Now that’ll fill my dry cistern of a head. But this is nothing like so bad as The Years. A nun writes to invite me to stage a meeting of Outsiders in Hyde Park. I stop to answer her. Gertler tonight."
1939.05.25,"A queer little note to run off in a hurry: L. is bargaining for 37 M. Sq upstairs: I’m packing. We’re off: & very likely I shant write much more in this now so tidy studio. Tidied for Ben to work in. I must pack upstairs. Brittany & Rodmell for 3 weeks.

Party last night. G. Keyneses: Eth Wn & her underworld friend. Ben Nicolson.

Interrupted by parties come to see the house. The first day its in the agents hands. Shall we end our lives looking in that great peaceful garden; in the sun? I hope so."
1939.06.23,"Back to London again after 4 weeks. Two spent driving about Brittany. I kept notes in a little square ruled pocketbook in my bag; a good method perhaps, if carried out in London; but I doubt if its worth sticking them here. Perhaps a few, for like pressed leaves they somehow bring back the whole forgotten hedge. So soon forgotten in bulk. The London uproar at once rushes in. Okampo today; John; then I must go to Penman. We have 37 M⁠[ecklenburgh] S⁠[quare]: & this is still unlet. Ben Nicolson has spread my studio with MSS all laid on the floor. This scarcely helps my attack on R⁠[oger Fry], begun this morning. The appallingly difficult PIP [Post-Impressionist] chapter. How to get the right proportions &c. I have now 5 weeks before August. And 200 pages to do. Difficulties with Gollancz about L.’s book not yet stated. And people abound. But I must do my job like a navvy & let society rip & clothes &c. Here’s lunch."
1939.06.24,"Yes, London broke in fairly vigorously yesterday. Ocampo bringing Giselle Freund & all her apparatus, which was set up in the drawing room, & all the lit. gents & ladies shown on a sheet. On top of them house seers—an old lady who was born at 52, & whose father had built this studio. And the upshot is, a sitting—oh curse this petty vulgar photography-advertising stunt—at 3. No getting out of it, with Okampo on the sofa, & Freund there in the flesh. So my afternoon is gone in the way to me most detestable & upsetting of all. A life sized life coloured animated photograph—however L. is drawn in. Also, on top of this, sheets of evasion & dishonesty from Gollancz; & John; & Nessa about Angelica. She is in a nursing home with an infected kidney. All the old anxieties rampant—for Nessa again. And old Mrs W. this afternoon. And Tom & a friend—& Sarton. I suppose there’s stir in it; & stimulus; but I’m bothered about the PIPs—cant get into the right mood; & its so laboured, & I cant, without a mood, toss it & lighten it: yet must somehow drive thro’ to the end.

Now to prepare for photography. Such are one’s friends—& their deformities."
1939.06.26,"Talk at Nessa’s last night. Much about Gertler’s suicide. He gassed himself 2 nights ago in his studio. We had talked with him about his other attempt the night he dined with us. It was because of some hitch in his work he said then, & he had completely recovered. He had got through into a new stage as a painter. This was true, Nessa & Duncan said; his last show, just over, was a great advance & very remarkable. So why did he turn on the gas, when his model left him? She found him, when [she] came back, still alive, but unconscious. A most resolute serious man: intellectual; fanatical about painting, even if a fanatical egotist. And he seemed established; with his own friends; dining out with Priestleys & Lynds. Poor of course, & forced to teach; & fundamentally perhaps too rigid, too self centred, too honest & narrow, like Kot in his uncompromising severity, to be content or happy. But with his intellect & interest, why did the personal life become too painful? His wife? We know no more.

Angelica better; & no time to describe our lunch with Flora, & her analysis, clear & unflinching, of the old tyrant, the matriarch manqueé."
1939.06.27,"Talk of Gertler at Clive’s. Old Cory rather deflated (in spirit, not body). Frothy talk, succeeding 2½ hours interview with Philip [Woolf] & his milky eyed little boy who wants to be a sailor. But doesnt want it very much. No, they dont want anything, said Phil, who doesnt want to go to Brittany, about which he consulted us.

Eliot & Morley today. So the days are rushed through.

Gollancz prevaricating."
1939.06.28,"Vita came to a late lunch; Mrs Woolf fell down & broke 2 ribs; Tom brought Mr Morley to tea … These are the elements upon which yesterday was founded. [illegible] with Vita. Home. Change. Talk. Telephone. L. to the nursing home after dinner. She will not die, so I assume. There is a terrible passive resistance to death in these old women. They have the immortality of the vampire. Poor Flora will be sucked drop by drop for years to come. This is I suppose a cruel remark to make. But honestly, everyone would be relieved if she could make an end of it. Its so exhausting, & as Flora said, she has contrived to falsify all emotions, till the end is the only thing the family who are forced to be so devoted by her fantasy honestly wish for. And now John to lunch. After wh. can I escape to buy some shoes, & ought I to buy shoes with the flat still to let? I’ve said I’ll write an article on Royalty for PP. for £25 by way of a sop to our income & our liabilities."
1939.06.29,"The grind of doing Roger & PIP makes my head spin, & I let it reel itself off for 10 minutes here. I wonder why; & if I shall ever read this again. Perhaps if I go on with my memoirs, also a relief from R., I shall make use of it.

A dismal day yesterday; shoe hunting in that Hall of humbug, Fortnums. A Sale; but only of the unsaleable. And the atmosphere, British upper classes: all tight & red nailed; myself a figure of fun—whips my skin: I fidget: but recoup myself walking in the rain through the Parks. Come home & try to concentrate on Pascal—I cant; still, its the only way of tuning up, & I get a calm if not understanding. These pin points of theology need a grasp beyond me. Still I see Lytton’s point—my dear old serpent. What a dream life is to be sure—that he should be dead, & I reading him; & trying to make out that we indented ourselves on the world; whereas I sometimes feel its been an illusion—gone so fast, lived so quickly; & nothing to show for it, save these little books. But that makes me dig my feet in, & squeeze the moment. So after dinner I walked to the Clinic with L.: waited outside with Sally tugging; watched the evening sight: oh & the purple grey clouds above Regents Park with the violet & yellow sky signs made me leap with pleasure.

Noise here very great. Even if we lose our rent, no doubt its worth it—37 will be heavenly quiet. The letter war with Gollancz continues—more time frittered, wasted. L. very calm; & how sane, compared with me."
1939.07.03,"L.’s mother died last night. And its been jading & somehow very depressing—watching her die. She gradually ceased to breathe. There were 3 days though of going there—sitting in the alcove in that long corridor. Flora sat with her. Sometimes she talked. L. found her cheerful one night. Virginia must write a book called “The fallen woman.” I remember that; out of a litter of odds & ends, because it was the last time she spoke of me. It was like watching an animal die, L. said. Rau burst into tears. She wanted to live, asked the matron if she had known an old woman recover, asked Rau. Both of course said Yes. Last night, as Flora, Edgar & Harold were dining here off cold chicken, Herbert rang up to say it was critical; & she had just died when they got there. Her breathing, as Rau said it would, stopped. And then they decided that her wish—to be taken to a private home, not left in the mortuary, must be gratified: so the body is taken to Laleham [Harold Woolf’s home] today: then will go to the Jewish Cemetery. A watcher came from the Synagogue. It was a bright, showery day. We walked in Regents Park, after giving Kingsley Martin lunch. I always notice the weather in which people die, as if the soul would notice if its wet or windy. Then, when L. had come back, we went round to Clive’s: found Nessa interviewing Lottie; & talked about doctors & skin diseases with Clive & Duncan.

But I cannot do my Royalty article, & have a regret for that spirited old lady, whom it was such a bore to visit. Still she was somebody: sitting on her high backed chair with the pink cushion, all the flowers round her, a cigar always for Leonard, & plates of cakes which she pressed us to eat. Last time—Saturday week—she was peevish & querulous. It was about not seeing Herbert as usual. Children no longer respected their parents. And she got up & fell back. But these feelings are mixed, scrappy, & I’m in the scraped state when writing dont work."
1939.07.06,"“Lady” to call her by the name she liked to explain—she always talked about the past best—was buried yesterday; & there was a service in the Synagogue. Women admitted, so I went. But its a compromise; & had nothing whatever to do with “Lady”. What was she like then? Let me see—She was small, narrow shouldered—things slipped off—she wore a low blouse with a pearl necklace—& rather heavy. Her head nodded. She had stiff curled grey black hair. She would say as we came in “And Virginia?” My joke was, Conceal your disappointment at sight of me. Then she would laugh, kiss me, & give me a little pat. We were on friendly laughing terms, always at the same stock joke, which carried us through those 2 hour teas. “And tell me what you have been doing?” I would have some story ready. She liked hearing about Ann & Judith: not much interested in any other relations of mine. For many years we never reached even this intimacy. I think she suspected me of not being family. She came over to see us of course. And how often we drove to Worthing! It was trumped up mostly. Yet there was something spontaneous about her. A great joy in family; in society; she could make friends out of anyone: was very popular with elderly gentlemen. One at Worthing stood her dinners, took her to the theatre. She liked telling the story of plays. She would tell the whole plot of Gone with the Wind for example; talking as if they were real: a trait odd to me in so shrewd a woman; for she had as she was often boasting, brought up 9 children. Never went to bed, she said, without a basket of socks by her side. All was personal. And the ruts of course became deeper; one knew what would come next. Sometimes tho’ she made me feel the daughter emotion—when I kissed her when Clara died. She attaches to nothing in my own life: except the comment she made; that she was the ‘elder generation’: & I (now the elder, to most people) was the younger. I never saw her save in her own surroundings. These were fussy, yes, but full of stir: always presents of flowers: children’s letters: What news of Bella & Tom? Where is Phil going for his holiday? She was the centre of that net work & until Edgar & Flora disabused me, I thought they depended on it. Perhaps, when the freedom is over, they will miss it. “Bel”—the day of whose retirement in March—poor old lady—was the “day I count the days to it…” so she said last Saturday week—Bel cabled a silly effusion wh. makes their relation look artificial. The truth was, age had taken everything away that was real, I think: only age left the pathetic animal, which was very real; the body that wanted to live. I know nothing of any interest about her, now that I come to write, only little anecdotes, about Holland: nothing that makes her a real person—save Is Virginia coming? which touches me."
1939.07.11,"Interrupted by a man to look over the Studio. Would take the place at once, if he could have it for 6 years. Thats the end of all these visits. Back from MH. & cross—to use the nurses word. Cross at my waste of time over PIPs, doubtful about the book—angry at the immense drudgery. Still I must get on. Q. for the weekend—oh that we could ever be wholly alone: & yet I dont want to be wholly alone. The usual fight between solitude & society, scarcely worth noting, let alone dissecting. Very fine July weather. And is Charles [Mauron] blind? And am I to buy a new dress? And what about—I think the true proportions are better in the country. Over all hangs war of course. A kind of perceptible but anonymous friction. Dantzig. The Poles vibrating in my room. Everything uncertain. We have got into the habit however. Work, work, I tell myself."
1939.07.12,"For the first time for weeks, after being so damnably down in the mouth yesterday, I’ve worked with some pleasure at R. The new Omega chapter. I might still pull it through. Yet how dumpish we were—starting off to the Movies, after dinner—L. asking me what I wanted to see, I not wanting to see anything—the crowds of deformed & stunted & vicious & sweating & ugly hooligans & harridans in the Tott. Ct. Road—the sticky heat—all this brooded, till I was saying, step out, on, on, in my usual desperate way. Then instead we went to Nessa’s. A⁠[ngelica]. in bed. Clive there: Duncan bubbling. I read Philip’s letter about L.’s Latin epitaph & we had a good laugh & gossip. P. has denounced Duncan’s portrait. I think a fine one. Wants a jolly girl; instead of this black frump. Mrs Gertler had been round to Pip at midnight with her guitar. P. looked out of the window & refused it. This is in the old B⁠[loomsbur]⁠y manner. P. in his nightcap, vagrant & vagulous. Duncan pobbling his words. Couldn’t remember Lady David Cecil, who has been arrested—no threatened. Burbling on about a book by a clergyman bought in Berwick Church. V. very silent, worried I suppose: yet ‘cheerful’ too. She will laugh & take part, even if she sinks again. Queer horror of seeing her exert herself. Perhaps I exaggerate. Julian in the background. Oh dear—why waste all that? But a jovial sunny evening that rolled off my glooms effectively; perhaps L.’s. Its not a nice season in London. To 37 this afternoon.

Now my mind is running on R. a good sign, at p. 230, so that’s more than half."
1939.07.13,"A bad morning. All fiddling again. Because I woke worried—about what? L.’s gloom: not lifting this; I dont know what; & lit up & read MacColl & started the machine running. And so am numb headed. What a head to work with—never again a long book. And no walk. 2 hours at M⁠[ecklenburgh]⁠S⁠[quare]. planning, electric light kitchen &c. The practical difficulty appals—all our books carpets furniture & L. gloomy. This is all surface gloom though. A grim thought struck me: wh. of these rooms shall I die in? Which is going to be the scene of some—oh no, I wont write out the tragedy that has to be acted there. A free man thinks of nothing &c. So I read Pascal & Pater & wrote letters & cooked dinner & did my embroidery. But couldnt sleep sound."
1939.07.25,"On this page I should sum up reflections on leaving 52 Tavistock Square. But—

Interruption. This must wait till M.H."
1939.07.28,"The use of this book is to write things out, hence: the Greenhouse. I’m so unhappy. A portmanteau word. Analysed: headache; guilt; remorse … The house, L.’s house, … oh dear, his hobby—his pear tree peach tree—to be pulled down because of me. How can I get sensible? I mind so much. Oh dear—the conflict—the ugliness: v: L.’s wish. And is it worth this misery?—oughtn’t I to have said go ahead, when he came to me in the Bath this morning? The men had come—Shd. they put it up? I said you must decide. So he sent them away & its to be pulled down. How to live it over? Forget he says: but I shant … & cant read or write—.

I have composed myself, momentarily, by reading through this years diary. Thats a use for it then. It composes. Why? I think shows one a stretch, when one’s grubbing in an inch. Head relieved anyhow by reading. Odd that I can read here without repulsion. Why? My own mind I suppose claws me when others slip.

I forget that we came down; & its been fine, rather; lovely on the marsh. Hay cutting. Figures spaced on the marsh. Old Bob thanks me for my letter. Much hurt by Stephen’s review. A letter from Susie Tweedsmuir—deadly dull at Quebec. Reading Gide’s diaries, recommended by poor death mask Eddie [Sackville-West]. An interesting knotted book. Its queer that diaries now pullulate. No one can settle to a work of art. Comment only. That explains but scarcely excuses Peter Lucas; & his exhibition of Prudence. Shd. one judge people by what they write? Shd. people show their naked skins? Eddie shows his death mask—Dear, I forgot my shudder at Helen’s son [omission]; nor can dissect my mix up of the debt, the dislike of Igor’s great fleshy mouth. (I’m whistling to keep up my spirits this very strained grey day—the Greenhouse morning.) I must now carry off lunch. What annoys me is L.’s adroitness in fathering the guilt on me. His highhandedness. I see the temptation. “Oh you dont want it—so I submit.” This spoilt bowls last night. We shied them at the Jack. Yet so happy in our reconciliation. “Do you ever think me beautiful now?” “The most beautiful of women”—"
1939.07.30,"The great affair of the GH. has been settled amicably: a cold house at the back. So its over; what a waste of emotion. Is it that I lack will? For now Nessa bothers me about mantelpieces. Human voices wake us & we drown. Never been so free & happy; but human voices do wake one. Its fine; & our day’s varied with what we enjoy. Such an expansion after the London pressure. I take my brain out, & fill it with books, as a sponge with water. Miss Robins—Kilvert—Gide—cdn’t read a word in London. Taking a day or two with PH. to rest myself from Roger. And have spun off a speech for Flavinda. Whether this book will ever compose, written thus at 3 month intervals, I doubt. But I’m all in favour of the wild, the experimental."
1939.07.31,"Human voices wake us & we drown—quotations on hearing the telephone yesterday asking us to Charleston. Bunny there; Angelica moody; conversation however well beaten up—Duncan’s 480 canvases; new studio: N.’s bedroom on the garden; Q.’s potting shed. Talk about Rumours of war. Bunny described K⁠[ingsley] M⁠[artin]’s ague, or malaria: fever high on Monday; sub-normal on Wednesday when paper gone to press. L. caps with anecdotes. N. gives an account of McDougall’s methods of selling pictures. How he wheedled Mr Schiff. Next Memoir meeting discussed. So home. Very cold & cloudy—yet the downs aglow with corn much to my liking. Today theyve chipped off the pink brick & removed the greenhouse shed. Really a load off my eye—queer what a relief—to see the shape of the wall & the pink Jackmanna again. How my eye feels rested. Now for the mantelpiece question. Then lunch. My poor old head very feeble—tho’ why? Trying it on PH. Age is it? or Roger? Walk this afternoon, & so lull oneself asleep."
1939.08.02,"I am trying to kid myself into believing that a penholder is a cigarette. So far I’m taken in. This by way of a solution of the old age problem, & improving my bowls.

London tomorrow. Katherine Furse to tackle … Certainly no cigarettes clears the brain—certainly the tongue. Must copy, out Roger on J.A.S. Oh these old bits of bones … Begin R. again on Friday I suppose."
1939.08.07,"I am now going to make the rash & bold experiment of breaking off, from condensing Vision & Design, to write here for 10 minutes instead of revising, as I ought, my mornings grind.

Oh yes. I thought of several things to write about. Not exactly diary. Reflections. Thats the fashionable dodge. Peter Lucas & Gide both at it. Neither can settle to creative art (I think, sans Roger, I could). Its the comment—the daily interjection—that comes handy in times like these. I too feel it. But what was I thinking?

I have been thinking about Censors. How visionary figures admonish us. Thats clear in an MS I’m reading. If I say this So & So will think me sentimental. If that … will think me Bourgeois. All books now seem to me surrounded by a circle of invisible censors. Hence their selfconsciousness, their restlessness. It wd. be worth while trying to discover what they are at the moment. Did Wordsworth have them? I doubt it. I read Ruth before breakfast. Its stillness, its unconsciousness, its lack of distraction, its concentration & the resulting “beauty” struck me. As if the mind must be allowed to settle undisturbed over the object in order to secrete the pearl.

Thats an idea for an article.

The figurative expression is that all the surroundings of the mind have come much closer. A child crying in the field brings poverty: my comfort: to mind. Ought I to go to the village sports? Ought thus breaks in to my contemplation.

Oh & I thought, as I was dressing, how interesting it would be to describe the approach of age, & the gradual coming of death. As people describe love. To note every symptom of failure: but why failure? To treat age as an experience that is different from the others; & to detect every one of the gradual stages towards death which is a tremendous experience, & not as unconscious at least in its approaches, as birth is.

I must now return to my grind. I think rather refreshed.

Clive at Cn yesterday, with an enormous white jersey which he patted & prodded from time to time. A little testy about his room.

I needn’t say I’ve been palmed off with the worst in [the] house. Desiring sympathy, Duncan said, & admiration. All his books were put in order by the others. Rather an elderly tea party. Q. away."
1939.08.09,"My grind has left me dazed & depressed. How on earth to bring off this chapter? God knows.

Percy gave notice yesterday. Something about leaving lilies in the shed did the trick. You dont like what I do—&c … Whether final or not, God knows, & we dont much care. These things always blow up once every other year. To Miss Robins today. A yeasty frowsty August in weather. I’m beaten nightly at bowls. Must air my head before lunch."
1939.08.25,"Perhaps it is more interesting to describe ‘The Crisis’ than R.’s love affairs. Yes we are in the very thick of it. Are we at war? At one I’m going to listen in. Its very different, emotionally, from last September. In London yesterday there was indifference almost. No crowd in the train—we went by train. No stir in the streets. One of the removers called up. Its fate, as the foreman said. What can you do against fate? Complete chaos at 37. Ann met in graveyard [St. George’s Fields]. No war, of course not, she said. John said Well I dont know what to think. But as a dress rehearsal its complete. Museums shut. Search light on Rodmell Hill. Ch⁠[amberlai]⁠n says danger imminent. The Russian pact a disagreeable & unforeseen surprise. Rather like a herd of sheep we are. No enthusiasm. Patient bewilderment. I suspect some desire “to get on with it”. Order double supplies & some coal. [Duncan Grant’s] Aunt Violet in refuge at Charleston. Unreal. Whiffs of despair. Difficult to work. Offer of £100 from Chambrun for a story. Haze over the marsh. Aeroplanes. One touch on the switch & we shall be at war. Dantzig not yet taken. Clerks cheerful. I add one little straw to another, waiting to go in, palsied with writing. There’s no cause now to fight for, said Ann. Communists baffled. Railway strike off. Ld. Halifax broadcasts in his country gentlemans voice. Louie says will clothes be dear? Underneath of course wells of pessimism. Young men torn to bits: mothers like Nessa 2 years ago. But again, some swerve to the right may come at any moment. The common feeling covers the private, then recedes. Discomfort & distraction. And all mixed with the mess at 37."
1939.08.28,"I stay out here, after bowls, to say—what? on this possibly last night of peace. Will the 9 o’clock bulletin end it all?—our lives, oh yes, & everything for the next 50 years? Everyone’s writing I suppose about this last day. I walked on the downs; lay under a cornstack & looked at the empty land & the pinkish clouds in a perfect blue summer afternoon sky. Not a sound. Workmen discussing war on the road—one for it, one against. So to bowls. I bowling am happy: I outside the garden what? Numb I think. Vita says she feels terror & horror early—revives then sinks. For us its like being on a small island. Neither of us has any physical fear. Why should we? But theres a vast calm cold gloom. And the strain. Like waiting a doctors verdict. And the young—young men smashed up. But the point is one is too numbed to think. London seemed cheery. Most people are numb & have a surface optimism. Hugh Slater yesterday, has an instinct that there wont be war. Old Clive sitting on the terrace, says “I dont want to live through it.” Explains that his life recedes. Has had the best. We privately are so content. Bliss day after day. So happy cooking dinner, reading, playing bowls. No feeling of patriotism. How to go on, through war?—thats the question. Of course I have my old spurs & my old flanks. No I cant get at it—so whats the use of staying out? One wanders in; dines; then listens. Sense tells me there’ll be no news till tomorrow. Yes, its a lovely still summer evening; not a sound. A swallow came into the sitting room. I talked to the girl who keeps elk hounds on the hill, by the ivy bloom tree. May flies buzz. I’m sleeveless in the heat. No word from Vita who was coming. How difficult, unexpectedly to write."
1939.08.30,"Not at war yet. Par⁠[liamen]⁠t met: yesterday. Negotiations. We are firm. A pause. L. & I discussing the Broadcast are up & down. Very black—then less so. L. pessimistic more than I am this morning. He thinks that H⁠[itler]. is making up his mind to spring. Raging voices began again last night in German. Last years mad voice heard again, as if he were lashing himself up. At the same time, a reply of 8 pages has been sent last night to the Cabinet. The French are out of it this time.

I’m dull headed. Spreading my mind out to synthesise the last chapter. Well, its a good thing as a distraction. Also wrote a synopsis of a story for Chabrun [Chambrun]. Will they really order 3,000 words on that flimsy sketch for £200? Seems impossible. Nobody keeps engagements or answers letters. A kind of block & suspension. No furniture unpacked. We go up tomorrow.

Brilliant—yes, the light is very evanescent—shining—weather. Very hot. To Lewes about shoes &c. All the tradespeople one wd say indifferent. Question of buying bicycles. Lots of bicycles. But why? Oh d’you think there’ll be a war?

Now I must listen to the one ’clock.

Red faced boys in khaki guarding Rodmell Hill. The soldiers in the village. Otherwise quiet & usual eno’…"
1939.09.01,"War is on us this morning. Hitler has taken Dantzig: has attacked—or is attacking—Poland. Our P⁠[arliamen]⁠t meets at 6 tonight. This after a day in London, submerged doubts & hopes. Last night we heard terms to Poland read. We then had some hope. Now at 1 I go in to listen I suppose to the declaration of war.

A dull hot day. I dont know why I write this, or what I feel, or shall feel. Children may come at 2—have told Mabel to come. All is hovering over us. And a grouse bought for John at Wimbledon for lunch & Inputting bags on fruit trees, & the man putting up our columns; & complete silence everywhere. 5 to 1 .."
1939.09.03,"This is I suppose certainly the last hour of peace. The time limit is out at 11. PM to broadcast at 11.15. L. & I “stood by” 10 minutes ago. Why repeat what’ll be in all the papers? We argued. L. said Greenwood was right—forcing the PM in the House last night. I argued its “they” as usual who do this. We as usual remain outside. If we win,—then what? L. said its better to win; because the Germans, vanquished, are what they are. Mus⁠[solini’]⁠s last try, a try on. All the formulae are now a mere surface for gangsters. So we chopped words. I suppose the bombs are falling on rooms like this in Warsaw. A fine sunny morning here; apples shining. Mabel came to my regret last night. Atmosphere at once stiff & prickly. Mustn’t mind, says L. No children yet come. Nessa & Angelica over as I took up the book yesterday. 14 in house: 3 children dumped. Maynard has given Q. a job as tractor driver. This is a relief. No one knows how we’re to fight. Rumours beginning. A flurry of people shopping in Lewes yesterday: the flight of cars with beds fairly thick. Shops rather empty. People buying stuff for windows. Little girl says If we have a chink they’ll spy us out. Flint [grocer] cross. Many of them that—as if half unhappy half resentful. No excitement visible. M⁠[abel]. said train very empty. I believe little exact notes are more interesting than reflections—the only reflection is that this is bosh & stuffing compared with the reality of reading say Tawney; writing, & re-writing one sentence of Roger. So this experiment proves the reality of the mind. Two hours sewing [black-out] curtains. An anodyne, pleasant to do something: but so tepid & insipid. One’s too tired, emotionally, to read a page. I tried Tawney last night—cdn’t concentrate. Church bells ringing. Mrs Ebbs carrying a sheaf of gladioli. Where from? Breaky Bottom. They hardly ever come to church, but now & then send lovely flowers for the church. Question: if we had a church? The relief of having some common outside interest or belief. If it were a belief … Q. & A. to eat John’s grouse.

Its the unreality of force that muffles every thing. Its now about 10.33. Not to attitudinise is one reflection. Nice to be entirely genuine & obscure. Then of course I shall have to work to make money. Thats a comfort. Write articles for America. I suppose take on some writing for some society. Keep the Press going. Of course no beds or heat on at 37. So far plenty of petrol. Sugar rationed. So I shall now go in. Nothing in the garden or meadows that strikes me out of the way—& certainly I cant write."
1939.09.06,"Our first air raid warning at 8.30 this morning. A warbling that gradually insinuates itself as I lay in bed. So dressed & walked on the terrace with L. Sky clear. All cottages shut. Breakfast. All clear. During the interval a raid on Southwark. No news.

The Hepworths came on Monday. Rather like a sea voyage. Forced conversation. Boredom. All meaning has run out of everything. Scarcely worth reading papers. The BBC gives any news the day before. Emptiness. Inefficiency. I may as well record these things. My plan is to force my brain to work on Roger. But Lord this is the worst of all my life’s experiences. I note that force is the dullest of experiences. It means feeling only bodily feelings: one gets cold & torpid. Endless interruptions. We have done the curtains. We have carried coals &c into the cottage for the 8 Battersea women & children. The expectant mothers are all quarrelling. Some went back yesterday. We took the car to be hooded, met Nessa, were driven to tea at Charleston. Yes, its an empty meaningless world now. Am I a coward? Physically I expect I am. Going to London tomorrow I expect frightens me. At a pinch eno’ adrenalin is secreted to keep one calm. But my brain stops. I took up my watch this morning & then put it down. Lost. That kind of thing annoys me. No doubt one can conquer this. But my mind seems to curl up & become undecided. To cure this one had better read a solid book like Tawney, an exercise of the muscles. The Hepworths are travelling books in Brighton. Shall I walk? Yes. Its the gnats & flies that settle on non-combatants. This war has begun in cold blood. One merely feels that the killing machine has to be set in action. So far, The Athena has been sunk. It seems entirely meaningless—a perfunctory slaughter, like taking a jar in one hand, a hammer in the other. Why must this be smashed? Nobody knows. This feeling is different from any before. And all the blood has been let out of common life. No movies or theatres allowed. No letters, except strays from America. “Reviewing” rejected by Atlantic. No friends write or ring up. Yes, a long sea voyage, with strangers making conversation, & lots of small bothers & arrangements seems the closest I can get. Of course all creative power is cut off.

Perfect summer weather.

[Later.] Its like an invalid who can look up & take a cup of tea—Suddenly one can take to the pen with relish. Result of a walk in the heat, clearing the fug & setting the blood working. This book will serve to accumulate notes, the fruit of such quickenings. And for the 100th time I repeat—any idea is more real than any amount of war misery. And what one’s made for. And the only contribution one can make—This little pitter patter of ideas is my whiff of shot in the cause of freedom—so I tell myself, thus bolstering up a figment—a phantom: recovering that sense of something pressing from outside which consolidates the mist, the non-existent.

I see Priestley consolidating his idea of himself too. Begins his article, Helping to receive refugees &c…. thus bringing before himself P. the active, the helper in the cause of common life: & so doubtless releasing his rush of ideas. But I dont like P.’s figment, necessary as it may be. I conceived the idea, walking in the sun baked marsh where I saw one clouded yellow, of making an article out of these 15 odd diaries. This will be an easy slope of work: not the steep grind of Roger. But shall I ever have a few hours to read in? I must. Tonight the Raid has diminished from a raid on Southwark; on Portsmouth; on Scarborough, to an attempt on the E. Coast without damage. Tomorrow we go up."
1939.09.11,"I have just read 3 or 4 Characters of Theophrastus, stumbling from Greek to English, & may as well make a note of it. Trying to anchor my mind on Greek. Rather successful. As usual, how Greek sticks, darts, eels in & out! No Latin wd have noted that a boor remembers his loans in the middle of the night. The Greek has his eye on the object. But its a long distance one has to roll away to get at Theophrastus & Plato. But worth the effort.

Mrs Nicholls a great frost. A painted metallic shrill nagging woman; with a mind that pecks the same rotten apple again—this side, that side. Her daughter: & her future: & Tigger the Dalmatian: full of her shoddy contacts; her cocktails: shall I buy a housecoat for raids or trousers? At last, at 8 am, she left us; but depressed, for one doesnt like coins to turn out false. Of course she ruined Sunday tea: Charleston over. Much grumbling from Clive at their inmates. Nessa who is making a chicken house is philosophic. But she compares the Grants & Breretons.

To London on Thursday. Pitiless fine weather. Over London a light spotted veil—the balloons. Very empty streets. A curious strained silence. At the Press, Miss P⁠[erkins, clerk]. listening for Sirens. So I listened. Sat in the sunny window. Cases all empty but piled up. Mabel & I laid carpets. Sandwiches with John. Stephen came in. His great joints seemed to crack. Eyes stared. Is writing reams about himself. Can’t settle to poetry. London after sunset a mediaevel city of darkness & brigandage. Mrs [Cyril] Connolly told by a taxi man he had just been robbed & knocked over the head. The darkness they say is the worst of it. The air raid had been very trying—at 2.30. John had drunk a glass of water & sat in the cellar. No one can control their nerves. So I was glad to be on the road home. No raids yet. Poland being conquered, & then—we shall be attended to.

I’ve offered to write for the NS. I dont know if wisely: but it’s best to have a job, & I dont think I can stand aloof with comfort at the moment. So my reasons are half in half. Intolerable tedium.—no papers: no letters; & all this made up talk with Nicholls.

Cooler now."
1939.09.23,"Meanwhile Poland has been gobbled up. Russia & Germany divide it. An aircraft carrier has been sunk. But there have been no raids. And I—having said impulsively that I would write for the NS by way of using my faculties patriotically—have written 2 & used up every morning to the margin. Also people have been staying here … oh such a fritter & agitation—solid weekends with Mrs Nicholls, Miss Perkins, Miss Woodward—both very good samples: public house life & greengrocers. So distracted I’ve scudded over the surface of the days. And now Stephen is on us alone; & so we shall be lip sore & addle headed. Then theres John on Monday.

Civilisation has shrunk. The Amenities are wilting. Theres no petrol today: so we are back again with our bicycles at Asheham 1915. And once more L. & I calculate our income. Can I give A. her allowance? How much must we both earn? Once more we are journalists. I’ve offered to do an article, required by The Times, on artists & the crisis; offered others. My old age of independence is thus in danger. But in fact its hard to keep aloof & do my books. Theres a pressure about an article—even White & Bewick—that keeps one absorbed. But how sick of 1500 words by Wednesday I shall get!

Then one begins stinting paper, sugar, butter, buying little hoards of matches. The elm tree that fell has been cut up. This will see us through 2 winters. They say the war will last 3 years. We had an SOS from Kingsley. He came for the night. What was it he cdn’t say on the telephone? Nothing. Should he come out in favour of peace? Cha⁠[mberlai]⁠n has the terms in his pocket. All in the know say we are beaten. Troops guard the East end. A bomb—& he means to bomb the docks—will lead to revolution. He was happy—but chuckling, quick & low, like a delirious bird. Always seeing himself, & pleased to see himself a martyr. Nothing of the least importance is said though in his article. A sensationalist—his mind rotted with hot coterie talk—all pitted & soft as a hot dis⁠[h]⁠cloth—steaming, unwholesome, unreal. Yet I rather liked him—a Celt.

I forget who else has been. Nessa painting L. Drove to Newhaven yesterday to buy plaster of Paris for Q. & we saw the 2 hospital ships painted green & white in the harbour. Many games of bowls. No reading. No Theophrastus—only article reading. But this must be stopped, as I’m now up to time with my little flutterers; & thank God old Mabel who is like one of the clammy kitchen flies, goes back on Tuesday. London no worse, she says than anywhere. An opinion I encourage."
1939.09.24,"Stephen scribbling diary—no, reading Proust in English in the drawing room. Doubts thrown upon Gilbert White out here. Odd how the diffuse, expostulating, exaggerating young disturb my atmosphere. Yet I shall get back. I’ve talked miles since last night, in spite of Stephen’s colic. A loose jointed mind—misty, clouded, suffusive. Nothing has outline. Very sensitive, tremulous, receptive & striding. So we’ve rambled over Inez: can she forgive herself. She has taken his money. Can she still be generous & large minded? over religion, at breakfast; over justice; & walking the terrace, we plunged & skimmed & hopped—from sodomy & women & writing & anonymity &—I forget. At last I said I must write—tho’ my little bowl was clouded & troubled by all this talk—& he must write; & so ordered boiled potatoes for his lunch; & sit in semi-retreat out here, re-typing without much conviction, G⁠[ilbert] W⁠[hite]. for the N.S. My own flurry & responsiveness is an awful bore—I can catch so many rumours & reverberate so instantaneously.

Freud is dead, the stop press says. Only these little facts interrupt the monotonous boom of the war. I get restless now & then & wd. like to be rubbing my back against London. And so must take a turn on the terrace, throw away my cigarette & go in to more rambling & discursive sauntering over all the countries of the mind. Yet, he says, I like the finished the definite: Bach & Gluck: then why sprawl so? But a very sensitive considerate man—not condensed into anything. And tremulous. And fertile. & I suppose poetical. Yet discriminating. John a bit coarse, obtuse. He has bought for £5 in the Ladbroke Road a press & type. Talk of starting a magazine. I read his MSS poems—all repetitions & gradual beatings out, mostly unintelligible. Whén I say we must discuss our works, without caring for praise, am I sincere? Could I do it? Never mind. Forge ahead, in my own little way."
1939.09.25,"The week end was sheer drudgery & has left me out of temper out of mood. Roger seems hopeless. Yet if one cant write, as Duncan said yesterday, one may as well kill oneself. Such despair comes over me—waking early. And we’re fretted & tormented with people—Portia Holman today, John—Vita. Then Q. & perhaps Judith—How can I cool & smooth my head? But I intend to work.

L.’s book [After the Deluge, vol. II] out today."
1939.09.27,"No I’m not sure of the date. And Vita is lunching here. I’m going to stop R⁠[oger] at 12. Then read something real. I’m not going to let my brain addle. Little sharp notes. For somehow my brain is not very vigorous at the end of a book tho’ I cd. dash off fiction or an article merrily eno’. Why not relieve it then? Wasnt it my conscientious grind at The Years that killed it. So I whizz off to Stevenson—Jekyll & Hyde—not much to my liking. Very fine clear Sept weather windy but lovely light. And I cant form letters."
1939.10.01,"This last week a mere scramble of people. Q. & Bradfield; then Judith; asked if she might stay. Then Leslie … talk talk—bowls in a blizzard. Proof correcting. Then the divine relief last night of silence alone with L. Rain today. But peace—my private peace—restored. London tomorrow. Sunday clearing up. Oh how torturing life in common is! like trying to drink a cup of tea & always its dashed from one. Judith has her jocose school girl garrulity increased by the rather commonplace Leslie. A pity she shd. marry him—porous, stupid, good humoured, Tunbridge Wells to the backbone."
1939.10.06,"Well, I have succeeded in despite of distractions to belong to other nations in copying out again the whole of Roger. Needless to say, its still to be revised, compacted, vitalised. And can I ever do it? The distractions are so incessant. Today I’m asked to take on Bunny’s job on the N.S. Yes I’ve been slipping into the frying pan of journalism—letting myself in for a monthly article, making, or attempting to make, £15.15 terms. All this is very frittering, exciting, degrading. And shivers my detachment. Also theres the war: or rather the non-war. Nothing happens. All is held up. Nightly we’re served out with a few facts, or a childstory of the adventures of a submarine. Hitler is said to make peace terms today. London is all agog; & also all a quiver. Raymond wrote me an SOS letter; describing the whirlpool—round round round—twigs, old curling paper & bits of straw—at the NS Office. Shaw writes an article; Maynard has a heart attack over it; KM. an attack of hysteria. Stonier is stony. Poor RM. prays for help from Leonard, even from me. Here its distracted weather—hailstorms & gales & sun; Nessa is painting L.: & theres a centre of rustic simplicity—old Botten picking up the walnuts & burbling on & I sitting on Kingston Hill & watching the destroying clouds point like a great feathered grey blue wing over the channel. Suddenly rain bursts & I dash home: a great evening, & bowls with L. I’m beaten. I compose articles on Lewis Carroll & read a great variety of books—Flaubert’s life, R.’s lectures, out at last, a life of Erasmus & Jacques Blanche. We are asked to lunch with Mrs Webb, who so often talks of us. And my hand seems as tremulous as an aspen. I have composed myself by tidying my room.

Cant quite see ray way now as to the next step in composition. Tom this week end.

I meant to record a Third Class Railway carriage conversation. The talk of business men. Their male detached lives. All politics. Deliberate, well set up, contemptuous & indifferent to the feminine. For example: one man hands the E. Standard, points to a womans photograph. “Women? Let her go home & bowl her hoop” said the man in blue serge with one smashed eye. “She’s a drag on him” another fragment. The son is going to lectures every night. Odd to look into this cool man’s world: so weather tight: insurance clerks all on top of their work; sealed up; self sufficient; admirable; caustic; laconic; objective; & completely provided for. Yet thin, sensitive: yet schoolboys: yet men who earn their livings. In the early train they said, “Cant think how people have time to go to war. It must be that the blokes haven’t got jobs.” “I prefer a fools paradise to a real hell.” “War’s lunacy. Mr Hitler & his set are gangsters. Like Al Capone”. Not a chink through which one can see art, or books. They play cross words when insurance shop fails."
1939.10.07,"Its odd how those first days of complete nullity when war broke out—have given place to such a pressure of ideas & work that I feel the old throb & spin in my head more of a drain than ever. The result partly of taking up journalism. A good move, I daresay; for it compacts; & forces me to organise. I’m masterfully pulling together those diffuse chapters of R. because I know I must stop & do an article. Ideas for articles obsess me. Why not try the one for The Times? No sooner said than I’m ravaged by ideas. Have to hold the Roger fort—for I will have the whole book typed & in Nessa’s hands by Xmas—by force. Cha⁠[m]⁠brun now demands a dog story: the other too sophisticated. So I have that floating about. In short I’m more on the buzz than when I was contemplating books only. And it keeps me feverishly skating over the thin ice.

We have a fortnight its said to consider Hitler’s terms. If rejected, all the guns boom. So we may get a last safe week in London. And I dont much want to go. Once settled here, it seems congenial to stop. The war has at least made the country question easy to solve. Tom sent me his Cat poems today. A very wet day.

Ch⁠[arlesto]⁠n. yesterday. Gages heard booming. Nessa exposed to show the house. A. & Q. in hiding A. says she will cry if I call her, compared with the public spirited Judith a butterfly. One review of L.’s book: good; but merely expositional.

Clive says everyone wants peace."
1939.10.22,"Oh let me fly from Roger to a page of a very different sort. We have spent a week in London. The poster read, at Wimbledon: “The War begins … Hitler says, Now its on”. So as we drove to M.S. I said “Its foolish to come to London the first day of war.” It seemed as if we were driving open eyed into a trap. The trap feeling was strong those first days. I kept one ear pricked. The flat was oh in such a mess—very small, very crowded. Whistles sounded. The dark was as thick as Hell. One seemed cut off. No wireless. There we sat. And people came running in & out. The Arnold Fosters: Tom: Stephen: John: we lunched with the Webbs. I recover; old age means an accumulation of the past. Like Wells one’s obsessed; or like Shaw scatter brained. The old woman, wearing a white spotted headdress, was as alive as a leaf on an autumn bonfire: burning, skeletonised. I was, & am, no not so much now, so harassed & distracted, with the trap on me, that I could not expand my mind to receive impressions.

You never escape the war in London. People are all thinking the same thing. All set on getting the day’s work done. Hitches & difficulties hold one up. Very few buses. Tubes closed. No children. No loitering. Everyone humped with a gas mask. Strain & grimness. At night its so verdurous & gloomy that one expects a badger or a fox to prowl along the pavement. A reversion to the middle ages with all the space & the silence of the country set in this forest of black houses. A torch blinks. An old gentleman revealed. He vanishes. That red light may be a taxi or a lampost. People grope their way to each others lairs. We were talking in our lair about 6 hours daily. Great caterpillars dug up the square. Gradually the sense of siege being normal replaced the fear—the individual fear. My ears were not pricked. It was irritating & one’s temper was rubbed. This was increased by the sheer discomfort & perpetual need for clearing drawers, arranging furniture. The kitchen very small. Everything too large. Stairs bad. No carpets. The clerks scream like parrots. Miss Woodward left in torrents of tears. Rain poured—profuse unbridled mediaeval rain. I wrote & rewrote in barren horror Lewis Carroll—my hands & feet cold. Did nothing—was indeed in fretful useless distraction. Sally was paralysed. L. had her rib plastered. So we came down & the world rises out of dark squalor into this divine natural peace. My brain is smoothing already, in spite of A. & Q. yesterday. Alone today & for many days. It was an odd morbid week of many disagreeable sensations."
1939.10.25,"About the 24th anyhow. And “the war begins today.” So Ribbenthrop said or rather howled last night. For so far its sporadic & halfhearted. How then can I say anything about it here? Here it peters out. I rode my cycle to Lewes yesterday. Now Nessa’s come & is painting L. & Sally is recovering. And its a blowy but sunny autumn day. And I’m screwed like a vice to the re-composing of the last chapter wh. I’m running into one, called Transformations. Its a question of arrangement. Then a new quote comes & alters all the proportions. But I think if I can see steadily for a fortnight I shall have grasped it. Temptations to write other things fret me. R.M⁠[ortimer], sends books. A dog story wd. bring in £200. & Freud’s papers. As a journalist I’m in demand (not with the TLS though). To relax I read Little Dorrit & think of going on with my Au⁠[tobiograph]⁠y. Never have I been so set on my own spinning. Gerald Heard’s book spun me to distraction last night. So good & suggestive & firm for 200 pages: then a mere bleat bitter repetition contorsion & inversion. Like a dog going after its tail; & there is no tail. No, he’s nothing to offer, once he’s done historical accounting. A mere tangle. And his fanatical starved or as he would say strangulated individuality presides. A scream, a distracted scream issues, instead of the soaring spirit. So I shant read Aldous. wh. develops GH in fiction. So to lunch. And a [WEA] meeting tonight."
1939.11.01,"Oh how gladly I reach for this free page for a 10 minutes scamper after copying & re-copying, digging in those old extract books for quotes all the morning! And how compose adapt oneself to the sense of freedom? How compete with the compression & lucidity & logic of Gide writing his Journal? Well, the plain truth is I cant. Yet ideas shoot into my head perpetually. Only as my head is always on the anvil—for I will finish this week—they skim away uncaught. It strikes me that Morgan probably keeps an admirable diary. I’d like to ask Morgan down. Our week ends are now taking the place of our dinners. Rather a laborious extension. But here we are settling in, very steadily, to a country life, & there’s much to be said for it. The space, the concentration, the freedom. Every day on my walk I get a colour bath: the greens dying, the winter colours burnishing. Society too is fairly brisk. There was Raymond (green trousers) Dora Morris (yellow jersey) at C⁠[harlesto]⁠n. last Sunday. Clive with his hair cut abrupt & truculent. Janice’s car has come. We are as free as before almost with our double ration. The car bucks & is draughty. We went to Tun. Wells [on 30 October]. Here am I evading ideas. One of these days I shall be free to write them. Tonight L. lectures to the new village group on Democracy. The village is hungry for lectures. Tom comes for the week end. Eddy Sackville invites himself for next week. London & 37 recede. Dim voices reach us. No war news. An admirable naval man broadcast about a convoy. And its grey & misty."
1939.11.09,"How glad I am to escape to my free page. But I think I’m nearing the end of my trouble with Roger, doing once more the last pages: & I think I like it better than before. I think the idea of breaking up the last chapter into sections was a good one. If only I can bring that end off. The worst of journalism is that it distracts. Like a shower on the top of the sea. Rev⁠[iewin]⁠g. came out last week; & was not let slip into obscurity as I expected. Lit Sup had a tart & peevish leader: the old tone of voice I know so well—rasped & injured. Then YY polite but aghast in the NS. And then my answer—Why an answer should always make me dance like a monkey at the Zoo, gibbering it over as I walk, & then re-writing, I dont know. It wasted a day. I suppose its all pure waste: yet if one’s an outsider, be an outsider—only dont for God’s sake attitudinise & take up the striking the becoming attitude.

We had a day in London [on 6 November]. Oh, yes, Tom for the week end: more supple, less caked & rigid than of old. His teaching he told me, is that one improves with age. I suppose the working of the divine spirit which as usual he adored at 8 on Sunday morning, receiving communion from Mr Ebbs—who did not impress him. The flat improved; a great thunderstorm; L. caught Louie’s cold: had to stand about; a feverish cold: better now; but now its pouring; & owing to my impulsive idiocy—saying I hoped to see him—Eddy Sackville has imposed his petulance upon us for this week end. Shall I tell him so? or must impulsiveness be punished? But remember another time how people grasp at straws. And how I hate being a straw. Two days will be ruined, just at the climax. And we’ve seen so many people; & these solitary days are so completely satisfactory. And if duty calls, its not to amuse young men with large country houses. Duty did not call me to listen to Mr Bradfield last night. Instead we listened to the ravings, the strangled hysterical sobbing swearing ranting of Hitler at the Beer Hall. The offer of mediation—Holland & Belgium—is the fat on the fire. Today they say there was an explosion after he’d left. Is it true? Theres no getting at truth now all the loud speakers are contradicting each other. Its a crosseyed squint, like the beams that make a tent over the church at night the searchlights meet there.

Mabel is here: pathetic to me in her dumb acceptance of snubs & all life is a snub to her. And now she’s ringing for lunch."
1939.11.13,"Monday morning after a week end is a wash out. I cannot re write R.’s last page. Thats laid to the account of Eddy. He was on guard against egotism, & was spry & bonny⁠[?] eno’; but I walked 7 miles alone to Charleston & suffer for it (as Nurse Lugton used to say). Today restless & unidead. Its a good shake up no doubt; but I wanted peace. I must devise a plan for evading the after book gloom. My flutter in the NS was a fritter. I had a letter of abuse in the TLS so I must dig myself in. Indeed I dont see why I should poke my head out again for a very long time. I’ve done my duty as an outsider for some months. And I suppose have only made myself more unpopular: ah yes: but freer. Thats the point. Never again shall I be asked to write for the TLS: thats a gain.

Mabel goes back on Wednesday; & we revert to the old happy obscurity with Louie. Save for Robson & A. & Q…. but they dont count."
1939.11.27,"Since I wrote here, we have been in London, had a party, A. & K. & Rose Mac; seen Colefax; & come back. It is all storm & rain now. Many ships sunk. Men out in boats. The magnetic mine active. Ch⁠[amberlai]⁠n. speaking like a military shopwalker. Ive been drudging at 2 articles, one Bewick; done & sent off R.’s first chapters. Feel rather free now I’m thoroughly snubbed & put in my place for Reviewing. L. was praised by Desmond in the Sunday Times—& Lord what a day! What a storm to rush through back to the house.

Lunch Charleston yesterday. Judith Bagenal; sharp; obvious; but assured & I should say a good worker, not a drone, will marry her clergyman I should say. Clive away. D. has sold a picture to the Queen. I forgot about our legacy. Nor do we know how much. Stella’s settlement money. This was a surprise. Henry wrote & told me. Perhaps 4 or 500 each? This will serve at anyrate to gild our pill—the 7/6 income tax. A long war its to be, Sybil said. The Empire to be destroyed in May. This is only the prelude to the operation. Now for the wet."
1939.11.29,"A nice dine & sleep visit from John, who pans out well under familiar scrutiny—dining in the kitchen &c—& things aren’t doing badly: in fact stirring under the blanket of war. Rosinski sells: L. slowly. Ideas sprout. For a Bloomsbury Book Club … for ‘our’ new magazine; I mean a revival of N⁠[ew].W⁠[riting].: to which Rosamund has sent a long story. Yes, the young do manage to pull along. I’m never to have a good review again. The Spec vicious, John says. And a long gossip … bed wetting at Eton; its disastrous consequences. Repressions—homosexuality: this explains, I suppose, John’s dash. One odd thing about the war is the failure of the post. No letters. John gets garrulous after wine. He cant make it up with Stephen. Stephen half lies about Horizon & his part in it mostly. Offers to bring it to the Hog. Steals young writers &c. I think its an emotional crux.

Wind & rain. Again, after a screw at articles, screwing at R. Withers says do I want stock or cash? L. says cash. How much? I have only 2 minutes left. I think I shall write a Monday Tuesday for N.W. No more long laboured articles at the moment. J. enthusiastic about [LW’s] Bs at Gate, which is out tomorrow. So I take a back place. Now I dont mind that. Should I, 20 years ago? J. says my R⁠[eviewing]. p⁠[amphle]⁠t. very interesting: couldnt be said by the young. Part of my Outsider Campaign. A letter from Shena Simon referring to 3 Gs."
1939.11.30,"Very jaded & tired & depressed & cross, & so take the liberty of expressing my feelings here. R. a failure—& what a grind … no more of that. I’m brain fagged & must resist the desire to tear up & cross out—must fill my mind with air & light, & walk & blanket it in fog. Rubber boots help—I can flounder over the marsh. No I will write a little memoir."
1939.12.02,"Tiredness & dejection give way if one day off is taken instantly. I went in & did my cushion. In the evening my pain in my head calmed. Ideas came back. This is a hint to be remembered. Always turn the pillow. Then I become a swarm of ideas. Only I must hive them till R. is done. It was annoying to get on to the surface & be so stung with my pamphlet [Reviewing]. No more controversy for a year, I vow. Ideas: about writers duty. No, I’ll shelve that. Began reading Freud last night; to enlarge the circumference, to give my brain a wider scope: to make it objective; to get outside. Thus defeat the shrinkage of age. Always take on new things. Break the rhythm &c. Use this page, now & then, for notes. Only they escape after the mornings grind.

L.’s book [Barbarians at the Gate] out and noticed at length. I forgot to note our very interesting talk about detachment at 37 t’other night. L. has trained himself to cut adrift completely from personal feelings: its common sense, because one has no real identity there: & losing it gives one the only happiness thats secure. Yes. to learn to discuss say ones work eliminating oneself. This is quite true—one gets it now & again—an astonishing freedom & expansion. L. very subtle & wise: & down here its made easier, owing to the open country. I saw a Kingfisher & a cormorant the other days walk in rubber boots. Planes very active. Russia attacking Finland. Nothing happens in England. Theres no reason anywhere. Brutes merely rampant. This suspends one’s judgment: makes it foolish even to discuss. Its like being in a temporary shelter with a violent storm raging outside. We wait. L.P. meeting here. Great diversity & freedom among the villagers.

Oh & my memoir will have to be compacted. And no letters. And the legacy may be £7 or 800. We go to 37 for 2 nights next week, & I see Ethel & Shena Simon. This life here has now become the rule; t’other the exception."
1939.12.08,"Two days in London: a great distraction; leaving my mind in a torn state, which I record, being all of a muzz. Lady Simon; a 3 talk, so a little disappointing. A nice woman. Did I wish to expose some egotism? I suppose so. Its breaking into new levels after concentrating here thats so distracting, & I daresay salutary. Shopping—tempted to buy jerseys & so on. I dislike this excitement, yet enjoy it. Ambivalence as Freud calls it. (I’m gulping up Freud). Then Ethel & Gillies. That upset me—Ethel’s wig—5 incongruous curls, that made her look babyish & foolish. Also she has gone downhill. She is now shut up quite alone in her old age—talks to herself, about herself. I felt this pathetic: also somehow ugly; humiliating; watching the old baby sucking its corals; compliments; the old story of her genius & its non-recognition. How hideous to be reduced to that kind of feeblemindedness—at 84. Something pitiable, unvenerable; not imbecile, but near it. Or was it partly her curls that were so distasteful? Gillies chattering about war secrets: Ethel mumbling on about what Bruno Walter said to—no I didnt listen after a time. And HB’s death; & what he said in 1890 about The Wreckers. I think it was pity more than anything that I felt; & all her clothes were undone; shaggy; untidy—like King Lear only without any tragedy or poetry. And the old charm in abeyance. Off she went to Plesh [Dr Plesch]. Then off I went to the Galeries Lafayette [Regent Street]. Out of that brilliancy I stepped into dead darkness—had no torch. A curious wild beauty—medieval, furtive—figures shuffling & darting Then Willie Robson. To stir the brew still further, into a race & whirlpool, a letter from The Forum asking me to write about women & peace. All the old, & a few new, ideas at once rise to the surface. I lay awake writing articles. It might be an outlet. But didn’t I swear I would abjure controversy for a year? Isnt R.F. a finer piece of work? But for America?—then the money—then the desire to let fly: also, I suppose, to justify myself? Cant form letters. Raining hard."
1939.12.09,"I suppose that is the date. It is a Saturday morning, & looks fine & still, after the broken whirlpool of weather yesterday. We took Louie to Lewes to have teeth out, & it was blackout driving for the first time. Like fog driving, one cant see people. All the cars have small red eyes. The margins of the road are lost. But I’m thinking of a dozen things as usual. Should I begin my Forum article with a definition of angle, to explain my angularity? Ideas pullulate, but escape when I try to catch them here. Freud is upsetting: reducing one to whirlpool; & I daresay truly. If we’re all instinct, the unconscious, whats all this about civilisation, the whole man, freedom &c? His savagery against God good. The falseness of loving one’s neighbours. The conscience as censor. Hate … But I’m too mixed. I’m going to begin Mill on Liberty [1859]. I’m making up for the hurried London years; spreading my mind, calmly to take in things wholly. Only thats Louie ringing for lunch. And L. is irritated with Percy—all the bulbs dug up when we were in London. And then Raymond wants me to write. And Shena is writing something for me—took that random shot to heart. I’m driving so many horses in my team. Probably we get 1100 (gross) from Stella. A great hare is hung in the kitchen, odd that we shall eat it. So, these are the little wild ponies that tug me so many ways at once. And I shall walk myself calm this afternoon."
1939.12.16,"The litter in this room is so appalling that it takes me 5 minutes to find my pen. R. all unsewn in bits. And I must take 50 pages, should be 100, up on Monday. Cant get the marriage chapter right. Proportion all wrong. Alteration, quotation, makes it worse. But its true I dont fuss quite so much as over a novel. I learned a lesson in re-writing The Years wh. I shall never forget. Always I say to myself Remember the horror of that. Yesterday I was, I suppose unnecessarily⁠[?], cheerful. 2 letters from admirers of 3 Gs; both genuine: one a soldier in the trenches; the other a distracted middle-class woman at Yeovil. And a letter which I must now answer from Stephen, asking me to contribute “On the Young” or anything to Horizon. No no. Still at war, he says, with John. If I write for glory its to be in our own paper.

Bought rubber boots yesterday. Met Lydia. Slapped her shoes on counter “Hugh Walpole—Priestly—tell Leonard—gossip—catching bus—off”. Roars of laughter in the shop. I explained her celebrity. L. bought a new mackintosh.

Horizon out; small; trivial, dull. So I think from not reading it. And now—oh now must I tidy up? London, the Hutchinsons &c looms. And I’ve promised to lecture the WEA at Brighton. And to write for the Forum."
1939.12.17,"Once more, as so often, I hunt for my dear old red-covered book, with what an instinct I’m not quite sure. For what the point of making these notes is I dont know; save that it becomes a necessity to uncramp, & some of it may interest me later. But what? For I never reach the depths; I’m too surface blown. And always scribble before going in—look quickly at my watch. Yes. 10 minutes left—what can I say. Nothing that needs thought: which is provoking; for I often think. And think the very thought I could write here. About being an outsider. About my defiance of professional decency. Another allusion of a tart kind to Mrs W. & her desire to kill reviewers in the Lit Sup. yesterday. Frank Swinnerton is the good boy, & I’m the bad little girl. And this is trivial. Compared with what? Oh the Graf Spee is going to steam out of Monte Video today into the jaws of death. And journalists & rich people are hiring aeroplanes from which to see the sight. This seems to me to bring war into a new angle; & our psychology. No time to work out. Anyhow the eyes of the whole world (BBC) are on the game; & several people will lie dead tonight, or in agony. And we shall have it served up for us as we sit over our logs this bitter winter night. And the British Captain has been given a KCB. & Horizon is out; & Louie has had her teeth out; & we ate too much hare pie last night; & I read Freud on Groups; & I’ve been titivating Roger: & this is the last page; & the year draws to an end; & we’ve asked Plomer for Xmas; &—now times up as usual. I’m reading Ricketts diary—all about the war the last war; & the Herbert diaries & … yes, Dadie’s Shakespeare, & notes overflow into my 2 books."
1940.01.03,"Monks House, Rodmell

This very large sheet which I bought at Baxter’s [Lewes stationers] two days ago begins a new year, on a new system. Evening over the fire writing, instead of end of the morning scrambling. Thus I hope to write a better hand, &, if it weren’t that I’ve just heated my head over Roger, the PIP [Post-Impressionists] (a bad chapter) more solidly. For unless I can put a little weight into this book, it’ll have no interest, even for an old woman, turning the pages. I have just put down Mill’s autobiography, after copying certain sentences in the volume I call, deceptively, the Albatross. We have been out in Janice’s car, looking for skating. Its a long bitter winter frost—I forget how many degrees of a night—I think 22 below freezing. Figure an Italian sun yesterday; & hard white snow; & the street like glass; the village treat to Brighton; chains round the wheels; the butcher saying he’d had enough of it, which, as he has to be in the shop cutting joints at 6, I can follow.

I am oppressed & distracted with all my ideas. All the little cuckoos shoving the old bird—Roger—out of the nest. A book on W⁠[ome]⁠n & peace—& here’s L. down from his book."
1940.01.06,"Which of our friends will interest posterity most? Maynard? So that if I had any regard for the future I would use this hour to record what he said. About his parents. Lying extended on the sofa the other night with the two fog lamps burning, & Lydia a sort of fairy tale elf in her fur cap. We were talking of my legacy; of Leonard’s mother. And L. said how she had lived in a dream world. So that he made her cry. Upon which M. said his parents had always let him alone: now they reaped the benefit. The old Dr plays Bridge; Mrs, his mother has M.’s temperament. “But not ruthless as you can be” said Lydia. M. hesitates, gulps & all his words come out in a rush. He is now supreme, mounted on his sick throne, a successful man—farmer, bursar, a man of business, he called himself, applying for petrol. A heavy man with a thick moustache. A moralist. As interested in Patsy the black dog with the bald patch as in Europe. He was saying—odd how hard it is to remember—he was telling us about salt; water; heat & cold & their effect on the urine. About Roger. “Can I mention erection?” I asked. Lydia “What?” M. “Stiff” (their private word). No you cant. I should mind your saying it. Such revelations have to be in key with their time. The time not come yet. Sodomy & the WC disinfected. Is he right, or only public school? All is now so ordered, so royally arrayed, that we had to go that Wednesday [27 December], because otherwise—“No Maynard says it is not convenient” L⁠[ydia]. on the telephone. But words are soon lost. I am writing this, the d—d party, the dark drive in prospect & L. glooming, in order to have a free fling.

So tight & tortured of a morning, but enough of that. Can I descend to the spontaneous populous strata … after living so long above ground? An obituary: Humbert Wolfe. Once I shared a packet of choc, creams with him, at Eileen Power’s. An admirer sent them. This was a fitting tribute. A theatrical looking glib man. Told me he was often asked if I were his wife. Volunteered that he was happily married, though his wife lived—Geneva? I forget; remember thinking, why protest? whats worrying you? Oh it was the night Arnold Bennett attacked me in the En Standard. Orlando? I was going to meet him at Sybil’s next day. There was a queer histrionic look in him, perhaps strain in him. Very self assured, outwardly. Inwardly lacerated by the taunt that he wrote too easily; & deified satire; thats my salvage from an autobiography of him—one of many, as if he were dissatisfied & must always draw & redraw his own picture. I suppose the origin of many of the new middle-aged autos. A kind of self psychoanalysis; oh & Viola Garvin—a fume rises from the old cabbage pail of literary gossip—was in love with him; a fact she expressed in a review of Requiem that positively split its sides, ripped open like a balloon—the pressure of praise in it was so terrific. Requiem Vita had with her at Oxford when I lectured once. How rotten, I said, looking at it, as it lay on the dressing table in the Inn. And she was glad she said, owning with her usual simplicity what I, should I?—have hidden. So the inspirer of these vague winter night memories—he who sends for the last time a faint film across my tired head—lies with those blackberry eyes shut in that sulphurous cavernous face. (If I were writing I should have to remove either lies or eyes. Is this right? Yes, I think for me; nor need it spoil the run. Only one must always practise every style: its the only way to keep on the boil: I mean the only way to avoid crust is to set a faggot of words in a blaze. That phrase flags. Well, let it. These pages only cost a fraction of a farthing, so that my exchequer isnt imperilled.)

Mill I should be reading. Or Little Dorrit, but both are gone stale, like a cheese thats been cut in & left. The first slice is always the best. Mr Gwynn⁠[e] caught me at Piddinghoe on the down yesterday—a nobleman: lean, sporting, dried, with little wet pebble eyes; a severe man. I smiled. He I think apprehended some incongruity: I was scrambling under the barbed wire in my wool helmet. “Where d’you come from?” “Only taking a walk”. “This is private.” “Hope I’m not spoiling your sport?” “Not at all. You can go on…” He’ll ask his wife, what odd looking woman lives at Rodmell. She’ll guess, Mrs Woolf. He’ll say … Louie says he’ll say he dont hold with the Labour Party. He had a row with Paul about the wood on his down. The villagers mustn’t steal it. Paul said they had a right. Story dwindles off. The idiot boy has pneumonia, should die but of course, wont."
1940.01.19,"I cant say that this after tea system has been good for this large page. But Sussex has been sociable. A⁠[ngelica]’s 21st birthday party, & its legacy of Lewises; then Flora; then Morgan; then London, from which we came back this after noon to frozen pipes. Dean is flaring away at the spare room at this instant, & this gives me an excuse for not nailing my brain to some solid book—an essay of Bertie [Russell]’s say. My London technique is improving. A concert at Nat Gal; Hugh [Walpole] & Wm Plomer to dinner, Sybil to tea—all accomplished. And last night The Importance of Being Earnest, a thinnish play, but a work of art; I mean, its bubble dont break. And I took about 60 pages to be typed.

By way of a brain graph, I record that for 5 days I could do nothing but improvise my WEA lecture—syllabled it in the bath, on walks; wrote a sketch nefariously. Now its spent, that fever, & I shall attack the Omega with appetite tomorrow. Why this sudden pressure on the brain? Its uncontrollable.

Hugh is rather like the winter sun—his ruddy edges slightly blurred. He wore a red flower. Wm. in a buff waistcoat, but sharpened, disappointed,—life unsatisfactory; embittered—no blur, rather a chopping block. I diagnose some sense of defeat & strain, part private, part war. A man in pain—on the stretch; so that some string gives a discord. No, thats not quite it. Looks dissipated, with work, with dull & dreary work; & no creativeness; but a standard, which dear old Hugh (he wrote to thank “Dearest Virginia” this morning) has forced down. I suppose a little second rate. At dinner when I told him that Maynard had read Sea Tower [1939], he looked like a small boy tipped—an endearing bashfulness. We talked—if I could face the labour of inverted commas—about Horizon: Stephen condemned; & about Humbert Wolfe; dead of overwork; about Frankau (his memoirs as chirpy as a robin—honest, edited of course, rasping, & with the real life profusion which only the shelly & tough skinned can stand) & then Hugh told us the story of the Conrads, told it very well: about C. sizing up the sod. masseur at tea; withdrawing, shrieking; & Miss Hallows & Jessie, who wouldnt ask Miss Hallows for the salt; & C. shut up alone with her; & Jessie growing fat on the sofa with her bad leg; about Boris & his forgery; so to diaries, his own left to Rupert Hart Davis; [omission] & so to Dickens; & the Vn hypocrisy, Thackeray haling a prostitute in the street opposite the Garrick; Dickens & his mistress; (all spoken as if they were old friends—so they are—if youre in the Hugh tradition, but Wm. & I arent)—so to Trollope; & defamation of Wells; a mere scribbler; compare him with Conrad. What then is an artist? A question I’d like to solve. A bitter cold night & they stayed till 12.30: then went into the moonlight, & left the door open.

Here I change pens: my hands are so cold; & my brains cold, yes, very like Janice’s cheap car, which wont start. One should have a piece of porous paper to press on the brain when its hot, instead of chafing it to work, as I do now, from idleness, from distraction. Oh I made up a little of P.H. at 37, & think I’ve tapped something perhaps—a new combination of the raw & the lyrical; how to slide over. I think 2 years at Roger may have filled the cistern.

Then Sybil. I was touched. Her cheeks were so cold when she came in. Why did she think it worth coming? Vanity was flattered. After working off all our graces & paces—Hugh to dine—oh Hugh wrote to me this morning—we got warmer about the past. She never liked George. Used to meet him at the Wards. He patronised her. He broke hearts. Dorothy Ward was in love—passionately. G. didn’t care. An arch snob. Old Gerald, the greedy, the vulgar, far more to him. The young intellectuals at the Savile liked him; disliked George. So I sketched our family life. She was more human—asked me to dine at the Ordinary. & went out into the bitter black & white square."
1940.01.20,"I think it would be better to read quietly some severe classic, & not make up some ranting rhymes, this bitter cold night. Smoking cigarettes over the fire & feeling—just because the rent of 37 is so high [£250 p.a.]—that we were, for once, foolish. Then L. went & skated & I walked on the bank & home over the marsh. The beauty was etherial, unreal, empty. A June day. 10 degrees of frost. All silent, as if offered from another world. No birds, no carts, men shooting. This specimen against the war. This heartless & perfect beauty. The willows ruby red, no rust red; plumed; soft; & all the roofs orange & red; & the hills white. But some emptiness in me—in my life—because L. said the rent was so high. And then the silence, the pure disembodied silence, in which the perfect specimen was presented; seemed to correspond to my own vacancy, walking muffled with the sun in my eyes, & nothing pressing urging only this iron hard, ground, all painted. The men were waiting for widgeon—the quickest birds. Come down like an express. We sat in the sun on the bank. All looked very distant, & picked out—the little stems of smoke—the wild duck—the horses huddled & still. No thoughts populated; I was somehow held in a pair of pincers, & came home to cook crumpets to revise my article; & all the words seem bodiless too. So what about a severe classic?

A fire at Charleston. Fire Engines called out on Wednesday night. No letters. Reaction after London? And Roger reeling off my fingers. And the future. I must tuck myself in with work. A child crying in the school. What do I do to help? But in fact, these are the moments for compacting; for living: unless one’s to blow out; which I entirely refuse to do."
1940.01.26,"These moments of despair—I mean glacial suspense—a painted fly in a glass case—have given way as they so often do to ecstasy. Is it that I have thrown off those two dead pigeons—my story, my Gas at Abbotsford (printed today). And so ideas rush in. I began one night, absolutely submerged, throttled, held in a vice with my nose rubbed against Roger—no way out—all hard as iron—to read Julian. And off winged my mind along those wild uplands. A hint for the future. Always relieve pressure by a flight. Always violently turn the pillow: hack an outlet. Often a trifle does. A review offered of Marie Corelli by the Listener. These are travellers notes which I offer myself shd I again be lost.

I think the last chapter must be sweated from 20 to 10 thousand. This is an attempt at the first words:—

“Transformations is the title that Roger Fry chose for this gave to [his] last book of essays. And it seems natural enough, But transformations must express not only change, but achievement looking back at the last ten years of his life, so full to choose it by way of title for them too so full were they of change, so little & also of achievement For They were also full of achievement. His position as a critic was became established His position as a critic was became established to choose a title wh. expresses change; they were full of experiment & experience Those changes, it was because they were he acquired a position They were years not years not of repose & stagnation. They were years of change, but of perpetual experiment & new experience. In the course of them His position as a critic became established. “At the time of his death” writes Howard Hannay, “Roger Fry’s position in the English art world was unique, & the only parallel to it is that of Ruskin at the height of his reputation.” And the perpetual This was achieved Perpetual speculation. But that position was only his because a room. So he But it was a position that The transformations then, the perpetual revisions of the his left threw out left behind them something that his thought that This perpetual revision of thought in the light of experience, resulted in something But this reputation position depended upon was the result of the freedo of his which he had the energy & the & the vigour with which he carried on his intellectual life; & so closely connected that it [is] impossible to separate them, went the other adventure with which he extended & enlarged his view. And it Nor was he less adventurous in his the other life which after all with which the oth nor is it possible to separate the two. And there too, transformations left resulted in what was something permanent, as Sir K Clark says: Although he was remarkably consistent in the main outlines of his beliefs, his mind was invincibly experimental & ready for any adventure, however far it might lead him beyond the boundaries of aesthetic academic tradition.

And Physically, the strain was very great. His health had suffered from the long years at the Omega

No I cannot reel it off at all. How queer the change is from private writing to public writing. And how exhausting. My little fund of gossip & comment is dried up. What was I going to say? Oh that the lyric mood of the winter—its intense spiritual exaltation—is over. The thaw has set in, & rain & wind, & the marsh is soggy, & patched with white, & two very small lambs were staggering in the east wind. One old ewe was being carted off; & shirking the horror I crept back by the hanger. Nor have I spent a virtuous evening, hacking at these phrases. I’m enjoying Burke though, & shall tune up on the French Revolution.

Q. last night. Miss Gardner on Federation. She writes short stories; her brother [Paul], a slip of a blue bell stalk beside Q.’s rosy sun, writes poetry, & is in touch with “our group”. We plan printing; indeed L. set up an address this afternoon. Then we hung Nessa’s picture, & it being now 6 o’clock, I shall take a plunge into some current. We go up next week, shall have Tom to dine & go to the new O’Neil play. No, its useless writing biography between tea & dinner. Better dream."
1940.01.30,"Unable to go to London because of the worst of all frosts. A sudden return. Everything glass glazed. Each blade is coated, has a rim of pure glass. Walking is like treading on stubble. The stiles & gates have a shiny green varnish of ice. Percy has to dig paths. Ink frozen. On Sunday no cars cd. move. Nessa said the Lewises had to give up. Thats the last I heard from Charleston. On Monday the electric light failed. Cooked breakfast on dining room fire. Came on at 12.30. Today all idea of travel impossible. Trains hours late or lost. No buses running. Walked to Lewes & back. Met snow plough; 2 or 3 cars; no walkers. Lewes very empty. Home by the short cut; which was painful. A great flight of wild geese. The grass is brittle, all the twigs are cased in clear brown cases, & look thick, but slippery, crystallised, as if they were twigs of fruit at dessert. Now & then the wireless reports a ship sunk in the North Sea. Almost out of meat, but at last the Coop sent. Very still tonight. More snow? No papers till the afternoon."
1940.01.31,"To that rapid note—how odd that I still feel I cant leave a new sight undescribed—there is nothing much to add today. It is thawing. Theres a rush, like a mattress falling, as the snow slides off the roof. We walked on the marsh, & saw a half devoured hare. Dabs of blood on the snow, & such a scrape of a wind, & such hobbling & tumbling over frozen tussocks into the snow that I cut the walk, & came home to type out my ten guinea Corelli. Vita is offered £1,850 for a 25,000 word story. My righteous backbone stiffens. Then what about my £200 dog story? Ah, but I wouldn’t for any money write 25,000 words. I think I’ve proved that to be true in this way: the humiliation, that is the obstinate refusal of the brain to comply & one’s drubbings, & re-writings, & general despondency, even for 2,000 words, make it not so much morally, as physically, intellectually a torture. But its interesting to take the moral temperature now & then. A little quick article I enjoy.

Settled in for another 2 weeks, & only village meetings & books; which however are very ‘real’—I like Burke. I think with luck I may concentrate & sweat out R.’s last Transformations. True, I should have enjoyed a wander, but old Mabel reports streets all ice & so on. And I cling to my tiny philosophy: to hug the present moment (in which the fire is going out)."
1940.02.02,"Met Nessa outside Uridges today so the frost of isolation is over. It was broken by a meeting though, at which I gossiped with Mrs Funnell & said I’d find her a dachshund. “Dasshund” she called it, being lower class.

I wish I could conglobulate reflections like Gide. Half of his are daily jottings. Then something solid forms. And they occur at breakfast, or when I’m up to my knees in mud. The lost thoughts—a fine covey they’d make if ever hived—the thoughts I’ve lost on Asheham down, & walking the river bank. Yesterday a smart car stopped: a glowing lady gave me a lift; burnished & aquiline like Bobo; said to [be] Mrs Drawbell of the hated house. The snow remains, slightly pocked, but the road is clear. The cream woman slipped another ½lb of butter into my bag; the Coops, inserted a lb. of sugar instead of sago into our groceries. And I’m asked not only to write, combatively on peace, for The Forum, but they want to reprint Reviewing. So, what with the Statesman & The Listener, no doubt I could grind out a good many Guineas: & I enjoy the friction: keeps my mind warm, thinking lost thoughts.

Mabel coming (alas) tomorrow. Then London.

I forget to make extracts from the papers, which boom, echoing, emptily, the BBC. Hitler’s speech—Churchill’s—a ship sunk—no survivors—a raft capsized—men rowing for 10 or 12 or 30 hours. How little one can explode now, as perhaps one would have done, had it been a single death. But the Black Out is far more murderous than the war. Prices rise by 2d then 3d. So the screw tightens gradually; & I cant even imagine London in peace—the lit nights, the buses roaring past Tavistock Square, the telephone ringing, & I scooping together with the utmost difficulty one night or afternoon alone. A reminder to use the present astonishing space for Burke &c. Only the fire sets me dreaming—of all the things I mean to write: the break in our lives from London to country is a far more complete one than any change of house. Yes, but I havent got the hang of it altogether. The immense space suddenly becomes vacant; then illuminated. And London, in nips, is cramped & creased. Odd how often I think with what is love I suppose of the City: of the walk to the Tower: that is my England; I mean, if a bomb destroyed one of those little alleys with the brass bound curtains & the river smell & the old woman reading I should feel—well, what the patriots feel—L. & Sally arrive."
1940.02.07,"(Mother’s birthday: Nessa’s wedding day.) Oh I had such a profound reflection on the tip of my tongue, L. being downstairs, chiming in with Bradfield’s lecture. It was to the effect that now, no longer in the movement, & remote in this water sogged country, now’s the time to see if the art, or life, creed, the belief in something existing independently of myself, will weather the/stand the hold good. These hesitations signify that I’ve been titivating R.: how spell Fr Bartolomeo?

Well, if it dont stand like a flagstaff, then its been a washout, (word chosen in deference to the new movement.) John for the night; & he plunges us in new this & that. Very nice—so eager & ‘boyish’ as the old women say: pulling up his shirt to show his rash. We had the Gardners to tea. The old wispy red veined blue eyed pussy purring Major. Very courteous, rather rambling, & inclined to dodder off into moralities about the Crab. That is why the crab is so small, & walks sideways—an old Indian story. The children bolt eyed & transfixed, partly in fear of what Papa might say. And John rather Prince Consort. So a fair beat up talk about poetry, about communism. John obviously bored, but chivalrous. And then out with his documents, & his plans. Radiant hope for the New Writing; for the young. Clearly his metier to go ringing his cowbell in advance. Inclined to write about Wm Morris. Oh & all the doings of the boys. Peter Watson sponged upon by Connolly, Guardsmen & Hamilton. The sink of buggery. Berkeley Square houses the whole hive. Stephen fallen into vice again; sentimentalising with Freud & another; Bleeding his heart all over the place; & J. half hurt, half scornful. Its a queer little eddy, just below the surface;—& familiar of old, tho’ not so highly organised. So I drivel longing for the meeting to be over. I will copy the days headlines—Towards a Settlement with Japan. The next phase in India; Red rout in Finland. 5,000 killed & no room for the rest."
1940.02.08,"Frau Dr—yes, she wasn’t Frau though she looked it—& her name? Hinder? Hinckel?—I never caught it so to speak firmly,—has just gone. This murky February day in which is concealed some flower, some little gesture, of spring—how does one feel that? how say it. The light that comes in a London street—more widely here; she has gone, back to London, to her house with its lounge & its modern Swedish furniture, in Hampstead Garden suburb. She saw her two babies off to Liverpool this morning to stay with their grandmother. And her husband is a doctor, & they are about to spend two weeks in Bath,—Oh to have a knapsack & go tramping! she said, being a swarthy hooknosed red cheeked racy Jewess. At least that phase lasted out lunch—We discussed races; she was born in South Africa. Natives smell she said. Native servants rooms smell very strong. We discussed how nice ordinary people are. Then why are they so repulsive in the mass? A question hot solved, partly because the landslip at Redhill had made her so late that lunch (roast chicken; apple amber;) lasted till 2.30. After that she & L. retired to the library to discuss a Fabian treatise on South Africa, wh. she is to undertake, & he to supervise; & I in rubbers & great coat plunged into the marsh, which was, as I’ve said, veiling, oh very effectively, for the wind blew, our unopened Spring. Here I stop to insert a remark often occurring: how we’re being led to the altar this spring: its flowers will I suppose nod & yellow & redden the garden with the bombs falling—oh, its a queer sense of suspense, being led up to the spring of 1940—So I came back, & had to offer tea. Now at tea she shrivelled in a hard high hat into the common, the lemon on steel acid vulgarity of the obvious, the cheap hard Jewess, which at lunch I hadn’t seen. Confronted with Nessa’s carpet Duncan’s table she could only remember her Hampstead lounge; a transition which made me think of the future: & what’ll it be, ruled & guided by these active & ambitious & after all competent, & I suppose able, Fabians—oh why dont they any of them embrace something—but what? Poetry, I suppose, the sensuous, the musical? Why must they always stress the ugliness of life; & yet be themselves so vital? And feeling chilled & put in my little compartment, I posted my letters & met poor dying Botten, & stopped L. on the high road & so have arrived here."
1940.02.09,"For some reason hope has revived. Now what served as bait? A letter from Joe Ackerley approving my Corelli? Not much. Tom dining with us? No. I think it was largely reading Stephen’s autobiography: tho’ it gave me a pang of envy, by its youth & its vigour, & some good novelists touches—I cd. pick holes though. But its odd—reading that & South Riding both mint new, give me a fillip after all the evenings I grind at Burke & Mill. A good thing to read one’s contemporaries, even rapid twinkling slice of life novels like poor W. H.’s. And then, I’ve polished off, to the last gaiter button, the 3 d—d chapters for London on Monday; & got my teeth I think firm into the last Transformations; & though of course I shall get the black shivers when I reread let alone submit to Nessa & Margery, I cant help thinking I’ve caught a good deal of that iridescent man in my oh so laborious butterfly net. I daresay I’ve written every page—certainly the last—10 or 15 times over. And I dont think I’ve killed: I think I’ve brisked. Hence an evening glow Yet the wind cuts like a scythe: the dining room carpet is turning to mould; & John Buchan has fallen on his head & is, apparently, dying. I have already composed a letter to Susie, who, poor goose, will be crying her eyes out, over there in the great carpeted Palace that she hated so. I think she “adored” him: that is being a goose, believed poor prolific John to be a kind of Providence. I remember all the MSS bound in blue morocco—scarcely corrected—a kind of genius, she said—wistfully looking for some corroboration. Indeed, she flattened me out with John’s biographies, inscribed by John. Monty Shearman is also dead; & Campbell, L.’s absurd nice old Parson friend—his bachelor Buffy friend.

Now the wind rises; something rattles, & thank God I’m not on the North Sea, nor taking off to raid Heligoland. Now I’m going to read Freud. Yes, Stephen gave me 3 hours of continuous illusion—& if one can get that still, there’s a world—whats the quotation—There’s a world outside? No. From Coriolanus?"
1940.02.11,"By way of postponing the writing of cheques—the war, by the way, has tied up my purse strings again, as in the old days of 11/- a week pocket money—I write here: & note that the authentic glow of finishing a book is on me. Does this mean its good; or only that I have delivered my mind successfully? Anyhow, after shivering yesterday, today I made a stride, & shall I think finish this week at 37. Its tight & conscientious anyhow. So, walking this mildish day, up to Telscombe I invented pages & pages of my lecture: which is to be full & fertile. The idea struck me that the Leaning Tower school is the school of auto-analysis after the suppression of the 19th Century. Quote Stevenson. This explains Stephen’s auto⁠[biograph]⁠y; Louis MacNeice &c. Also I get the idea of cerebration: poetry that is not unconscious, but stirred by surface irritation, to which the alien matter of politics, that cant be fused, contributes. Hence the lack of suggestive power. Is the best poetry that which is most suggestive—is it made of the fusion of many different ideas, so that it says more than is explicable? Well thats the line; & it leads to Public Libraries: & the supersession of aristocratic culture by common readers. Also to the end of class literature: the beginning of character literature; new words from new blood; & the comparison with the Elizabethans. I think there’s something in the psycho-analy⁠[s]⁠is idea: that the L.Tower writer couldn’t describe society; had therefore to describe himself, as the product, or victim: a necessary step towards freeing the next generation of repressions. A new conception of the writer needed: & they have demolished the romance of ‘genius’ of the great man, by diminishing themselves. They haven’t explored, like H. James, the individual: they havent deepened; theyve cut the outline sharper. And so on.

L. saw a grey heraldic bird: I only saw my thoughts. No news from Charleston, but so absorbed in all this, I’m indifferent."
1940.02.16,"This diary might be divided into London diary & Country. I think there is a division. Just back from the London chapter. Bitter cold. This shortened my walk, which I meant to be through crowded streets. Then the dark—no lighted windows, depressed me. Standing in Whitehall, I said to my horses “Home John”, & drove back in the grey dawn light, the cheerless spectral light of fading evening on houses—so much more cheerless than the country evening—to Holborn, & so to the bright cave, wh. I liked better, having shifted the chairs. How silent it is there—& London silent; a great dumb ox lying couchant. The people I saw were, Margery Fry: 2 or 3 hours: a touching soft furred bundle; red nosed, or cheeked, with so many thorns in her softness. I remember: “People are divided into lovers & friends”—to justify her lack of love. So we rummaged in old memories, & revived whats been said so often about Roger’s loves & character. She is off to France, & pricked my apathy by suggesting that I should come—& made me deplore my spineless acquiescence; she so mobile.

Dinner party: Tom & Saxon: Clive in afterwards. Saxon a pink plump hoarse oldish man: in his raucous sudden mood: complete silence; then raps out some statement, as hard as a walnut—no sequence, no suggestiveness. Tom’s great yellow bronze mask all draped upon an iron framework. An inhibited, nerve drawn; dropped face—as if hung on a scaffold of heavy private brooding; & thought. A very serious face. & broken by the flicker of relief, when other people interrupt. But our talk?—it was about Civilization. All the gents, against me. Said very likely, more likely than not, this war means that the barbarian will gradually freeze out culture. Nor have we improved. Tom & Saxon said the Greeks were more thoroughly civilised. The slave was not so much a slave as ours are. Clive also pessimised—saw the light going out gradually. So I flung some rather crazy theories into the air. Then to Humbert Wolfe, striking odd little sparks from Tom’s ‘genius’ vanity. Thats refreshing, his innocent seriousness about himself as a writer. About H.W. Clive told a story—how at the Ivy [Restaurant] he received his death blow from E. Bibesco, who read him 30 pages: so he went home & died. That led to Tom’s saying he used commas at the beginning of a line; so I added, & no capitals. Then we searched for an old book to trace capital letters. Saxon emitted some scholars facts. What else? It lasted till 12, so there must have been other sayings: John Buchan, I suppose. Yes, he died, & I haven’t yet written to poor black Susie, who’s unhappy I suspect, clinging to her John as lightning conductor. Tom talked about Stephen’s diary. Pages of S.’s conversation “for I cant remember what T.S.E. said”—were sent to T.S.E. He’s benevolent & tolerant of the young. Oh & Yeats. Tom said Turner had made up to Yeats; who was an ill read man; & Dotty successfully imitated him—hence her trumpeting. A good deal of cold weather talk—Tom’s landlady providing one jug of water, & Tom bathing at Fabers. Oh & Sydney Waterlow. “I never knew them (S. & Dawks) in the moment of e⁠[c]⁠stasy”—Tom said with his sly smile. & I thought the same of Tom & Vivienne. S. says Saxon feels himself on the shelf, & so digs hard. This is more or less an accurate specimen of talk in the winter preceding the Spring of 1940.

I had Cilia’s Finnish letter. People suddenly become grave: forget gossip; remember what at least they ought to be feeling. She [unidentified] wrote to me, out of the blue, about the death, or immortality of Finland. How little that means, at 37 … no: it means something, but what?—Then I suffered from my clothes complex acutely buying 2 new sets of clothes, & being persuaded into a blue striped coat by an astute & human woman at Lewises. “But I want you to have this—I dont want you just because you’re in the country, to fling on anything. You’ve got to think of others” .. as if she guessed all my private life—queer: she seemed genuine. Of course I looked a shaggy dowdy old woman. Then to Desire under the Elms: disappointing; flat; elemental situation bare of words; like a scaffold. And B.L. not exciting: & the streets tunnels of gloom."
1940.02.19,"I may as well make a note I say to myself; thinking sometimes who’s going to read all this scribble? I think one day I may brew a tiny ingot out of it—in my memoirs. Lytton is hinted as my next task by the way. And 3 Gs a dead failure in USA: but enough. I was going to write about Sally [Chilver].

The snow came down on Saturday: thick white cake sugar all over the garden, blowing into my room in the night: door hinge frozen. She arrived battered, carrying her case, how unlike John, up from Southease; left this morning. And oh to be alone—after 5 nights talk—A very nice young woman, with a brain; a magpie I called her: has picked up so many facts: & adds objective facts: about cars, pumps, politics. Thats her line. Not art: tho’ she struck me by her dispraise of the neo Corns; & her respect for the artist—Sitwells for instance. A lunch & tea at Charleston. “Blow your nose” said Clive. Snow falling. Talk—gossip: Robert Graves has left Laura; Anreps; An⁠[astasi]⁠a left debts to be paid by Sally; Nessa feeding hens; gave us 6 new eggs. Duncan asked us to buy cigarettes, wh. I did standing in the snow. Political argument about USA & Ireland between Q., Clive, & Sally. Her real name’s Elizabeth. Angelica silent, not disapproving. Sally (dog) kissed Leonard. L. smiled at me. Talk about Hugh W. about Eddy Devonshire—about—I suppose mostly gossip, with some extravagance, about Frys, & poor Helen’s autopsy—brain pressed by a bone—contributed by me. London adventures. Saxon by the way wrote to thank me. Home to cook turkey—tough.

Now the thaw has come: L. has his barometer: explains it to me. Walk over Mount Misery. Snow still thick, but the cart tracks run with rivulets. Snow cleared half way to Knotts Bushes. A dim wet ordinary spring winter day. Snowdrops on the graves. L. lent Connolly [Frederick Conolley, a farm hand] a pound. Turned in to the Army by Botten.

So Sally went, & kissed me, being a warm hearted woman, rather valiant, & free minded. What’ll become of her? Oh & my new coat, the blue striped one, came, & its not too loud: I’m pleased. And so the week starts again; & I must send off—oh I cant defer it—Roger to M⁠[argery Fry]."
1940.03.07,"A fortnight—well on Saturday it will be a fortnight—with influenza. Up today for the first time. So it shows my inveterate—whats the word for love of writing?—that I open this. Head a white vapour: legs bent candles. All hope abandoned. I think that was the main current, lying in bed. Too feverish in London to abandon hope. Had to scribble down my Lecture, until that was abandoned; & correct the last script of R. Then back on Saturday to bed: with a throat like plates of rough iron, which cracked when I swallowed. Oh & before getting into bed that bitter afternoon I read my epitaph—Mrs W. died so soon, in the N.S. & was pleased to support that dismissal very tolerably. A firm conviction somewhere in my survival power. Yet there I lay abandoned. And read all Havelock Ellis, a cautious cumulative, teased & tired book; too pressed down with that very common woman, Edith: so I judged her; but she was life to him: he lacked life; lacked all quick response: & she was stirring; farmed; preached; at last leapt out of [a] window. And loved women. He’s honest & clear but thick [illegible] & too like the slow graceful Kangaroo with its cautious soft leaps. But thats much due to influenza. Nessa yesterday. Out on terrace today. Spring smells—clean, sharp, varied. Crocuses out & snowdrops. L. making rock garden. All sounds of human life stilled. Robins & Smyth bag unattended. Some nice person, wanting to hear me lecture, sent me violets. A calm convalesence. But how now can we bring out R.? And does it matter? Anyhow finished. And my brain neednt run on. The lecture can run itself. And … & … I forget. Oh its the spring thats come while I was ill—birds chirping. P⁠[ercy]. spraying apple trees; blue crocuses with snowdrops. Yes: eno’ to try my hand on is done."
1940.03.20,"Yes, another attack—in fact 2 other attacks: one Sunday week [10 March]—101 with Angelica there to put me to bed; tother last Friday, 102 after lunch. So to bed up here in L.’s room, & Dr Tooth, who keeps me in bed (where I sit up with L. reading proofs) till tomorrow. Thats the boring history. What they call recurring with slight bronchitis. Yes. And the Book’s read [Roger Fry]. & cd. I write out my chart, it wd. be interesting. One Sunday (the 101 Sunday) L. gave me a very severe lecture on the first half. We walked in the meadows. It was like being pecked by a very hard strong beak. The more he pecked the deeper, as always happens. At last he was almost angry that I’d chosen “what seems to me the wrong method. Its merely anal⁠[ysis], not history. Austere repression. In fact dull to the outsider. All those dead quotations.” His theme was that you cant treat a life like that: must be seen from the writers angle, unless the liver is himself a seer, wh. R. wasnt. It was a curious example of L. at his most rational & impersonal: rather impressive; yet so definite, so emphatic, that I felt convinced: I mean of failure; save for one odd gleam, that he was himself on the wrong tack, & persisting for some deep reason—dissympathy with R.? lack of interest in personality? Lord knows. I note this plaited strand in my mind; & even while we walked & the beak struck deeper deeper had this completely detached interest in L. character. Then Nessa came; disagreed: Margery’s letter “very alive & interesting”; then L. read the 2nd half thought it ended on the doorstep at Bernard St.; then N.’s note “I’m crying cant thank you”—then N. & D. to tea up here; forbid me to alter anything; then Margery’s final letter—“Its him … unbounded admiration”. There I pause. Well, I think I re-write certain passages, have even in bed sketched them, but how in time for this spring? That I shelve till tomorrow. Great relief all the same. Its a slippery floor this: great flower pots; L. walking on his rubber soles; a plan to make this my bedroom: have a bath in cupboard. Yes, its a great relief. Suppose all the first half were to do again—as I’d decided—3 months grind .. And Lord to be quit of it & free—& Lord to have given Nessa back her Roger, lost since Julian died. Also I’m rather proud of my tenacity & conscience in that book: & want to—I suppose to increase my reputation, as biographer, when its sunk as novelist: want to be winging off on small articles & stories. Dog story brought in £170 today; a translation £20; & then Cha⁠[m]⁠brun says Harpers wants an essay on Ly Hester Stanhope: the book I read that Christmas at Lelant, & finished too soon, & put Lytton on the scent of. Yes; so I’m set up: & had a letter from Vita, who says we’re out of touch, & she minds. Not on my side I reply. She dont answer. I write to say why dont you answer … I think thats a fair though fuggy & frowsty annal (hows it spelt?) of the past 2 weeks. Cold blue & white weather from my window. Mabel here. Suavity & capacity itself, tho’ the usual strain with L. & Louie. War thought to be beginning. Peace with Finns. The G.’s raid Scapa. A disgrace. So we raid them. This may prelude a general attack. But why waste even this half inch upon these blaring & boring politics? Even Tooth, the red haired Dr whose name shd. be Hector told me he had no kind or sort of enthusiasm for this war—yet had craved for the last. Yet we must stick it out he said. An average decent opinion."
1940.03.21,"Here is the Good Friday festival beginning. How one can sense that in a garden, with flowers & birds only, I cant say. Now for me begins the twilight hour, the emerging hour, of disagreeable compromise. Up to lunch. In the sitting room for tea. You know the dreary, messy, uncomfortable paper strewn, picking at this & that frame of mind. And with R. hanging over me. Walk out as soon as possible, & keep on reading Hervey’s memoirs. And so come to the top slowly. I’m thinking of some articles. Sidney Smith. Madame de Stael. Virgil. Tolstoy, or perhaps Gogol. Now I’ll get L. to find a life of Smith in the Lewes Library. A good idea. Poor L.—who looks like an Elizabethan, the picture of Charles Lamb, with his green velvet collar standing round his neck—& so bothered with fetching & carrying, & so serious, & with the old roadmenders bucket of red coal smouldering in him. I’ll ring up Nessa about sending Helen that chapter, & establish an engagement.

I read Tolstoy at Breakfast—Goldenweiser, that I translated with Kot in 1923 & have almost forgotten. Always the same reality—like touching an exposed electric wire. Even so imperfectly conveyed—his rugged short cut mind—to me the most, not sympathetic, but inspiring, rousing; genius in the raw. Thus more disturbing, more ‘shocking’ more of a thunderclap, even on art, even on lit.re than any other writer. I remember that was my feeling about W. & Peace, read in bed at Twickenham. Old Savage picked it up. “Splendid stuff!” & Jean tried to admire what was a revelation to me. Its directness, its reality. Yet he’s against photographic realism.

Sally is lame & has to go to the vet. Sun coming out. One bird pierces like a needle. All crocuses & squills out. No leaves, or buds on trees.

I’m quoted, about Russian, in Lit sup leader oddly enough.

Easter Sunday 24 March

A curious sub-life has set in, rather spacious, rather leisured, & secluded & content. Still sleep in L.’s room; then I slowly bath & dress & sit in the sitting room, quietly, entering M⁠[argery’]⁠s corrections. Not much bothered really, though I’ve so short a time. I cant help thinking, in spite of L., that its interesting: & I can I think liven & improve. And I’m buoyed up by M. & N. & D. And feel in one fortnight I shall be quit (oh no, there’ll be proofs). This is an egg shell life—so gingerly do I step to avoid rousing my temp: which was 99 pt 4 & is again a little up: but if I dont walk in the wind I think I can refrigerate, & yet keep my brain calm for the morning. Wobbly like one of the spring lambs in my legs. Mabel increases comfort 100 fold. And its refreshing & rejuvenating to see the gold thick clumps of crocuses, & the unopened green daffodils, & to hear my Asheham rooks dropping their husky caws through the gummy air. Birds are having a trial. L. works all the afternoon in his blue shirt making the rock garden. Old Botten is dying. Mabel & Louie have gone to church at Southease, & the Lambs bleat.

I’m beginning Sense & Sensibility—& reading about Apes. That reminds me—to do a C⁠[ommon]. R⁠[eader]. on Darwin. V. of the Beagle one section: Downe the other. So when I’m quit of R. & of the WEA I shall do little articles—& oh the relief of not having the whole building of a book on my shoulders! Of course there’ll be the wave splash in June, if we bring it out; but I’m fortified beforehand—thats odd. The first book thats been read first by others. Dear me, tho’, I’ve many paragraphs to rewrite, & there’s the end, & Helen still to comment. All the birds are sitting up in L. & V. The twig carrying has begun, & this goes on while all the guns are pointed & charged & no one dares pull the trigger. Not a sound this evening to bring in the human tears. I remember the sudden profuse shower one night just before war wh. made me think of all men & women weeping."
1940.03.26,"A curious letter from Hugh this afternoon, part of which I will copy, for I like reading old letters.

“As to my book (I wrote about Roman Fountain) of course I knew that you would dislike some of it very much, but hoped you wd like some which apparently you do. MacCarthy speaks to me as to a child, so does Harold N. talking of my babyish love of my toys in the D.T…. But do you care to hear the truth? Half of me is very mature, half has never grown up at all. I cant help my excitement which irritates you all. I never had anything when I was young (cant read). As to my writing you & I are the opposite ends of the bloody stick? You are the supreme example of the aesthetic-conscience—there has never been such another in English fiction. But you dont write novels. What you write needs a new name. I am the true novelist—a minor one but a true one. I know a lot about the novel & a lot about life seen from my very twisted child-haunted angle. Had I been normal I might have been a major novelist. As it is I am a Siamese twin…”

No I cant be bothered to copy any more. It rushes up into a Bengal light spirit of self-glorification—crocuses, sausages, Harold & chess—at the end, & skirts all the thorns & all the truth as usual. What Desmond said was he hasnt a “rare” mind … Dear dear, I’ve no mind to add my own comment.

John rings up to ask if he may bring a friend—a London friend—to lunch tomorrow. Then shall we ask Nessa to bring Helen to meet Margery? And there’s London on Monday … And I’m half inclined to kick my heels & despatch R. to the printer; & get rid of my artistic conscience. Ignorance was the begetter of that conscience. When I wrote TLS articles & knew nothing I slaved to make every sentence do instead of accuracy. How one’s mind interests one! A mercy, seeing its a wild tempest of a day: no outing; rain lashing & streaking the windows. Lottie & Grace over. A great flirt with Percy & presents of tomatoes & plants. And yesterday old Botten faded out under the eyes of Mrs West who’s layer out & night watcher to the village. A frail old man; the last of the old villagers—save Dedman—talking the melodious Sussex, sprinkled with words like ‘nard’ for shoulder, wily & sly & grasping; yet poetic too. And a bore. Bringing the milk he’d stay talking, so we always cut at the sight of him. Like a pollard willow grey greaved moss grown to look at—a tree I mean with very small shrivelled grey leaves.

And what else to fill the page! Such a batter at the window. The effect of the war on weather. Shall I listen in, & rake some music my way instead of raking my mind? No, I will not look at R. again."
1940.03.29,"What shall I think of that⁠[s] liberating & freshening? I’m in the mood when I open my window at night & look at the stars. Unfortunately its 12.15 on a grey dull day, the aeroplanes are active, Botten is to be buried at 3: & I’m brain creased after Margery, after John & his John after Q.. But its the little antlike nibblings of M. that infest me—ants run in my brain—emendations, tributes, feelings, dates—& all the detail that seems to the non-writer so easy (“just to add this about Joan &c”) & to me is torture. Thumbing those old pages—& copying onto the carbon. Lord lord! And influenza damped. Well I recur what shall I think of? The river. Say the Thames at London bridge; & buying a notebook; & then walking along the Strand & letting each face give me a buffet; & each shop; & perhaps a Penguin. For we’re up in London on Monday. Then I think I’ll read an Elizabethan—like swinging from bough to bough. Then back here I’ll saunter … oh yes & we’ll travel our books round the Coast—& have tea in a shop—& look at antiques, & there’ll be a lovely farmhouse—or a new lane—& flowers—& bowls with L. & reading very calmly for C.Rs. but no pressure. & May coming & asparagus, & butterflies. Perhaps I’ll garden a little oh & print, & change my bedroom furniture. Is it age, or what that makes life here alone, no London no visitors seem a long trance of pleasure—or might be, could I be quit of Helen A. & R.

I’m inducing a state of peace & sensation feeling—not idea feeling. The truth is we’ve not seen spring in the country since I was ill at Asheham—1914—& that had its holiness in spite of the depression. I think I’ll also dream a poet-prose book, perhaps make a cake now & then. Now, now—never any more future skirmishing or past regretting—relish the Monday & the Tuesday & dont take on the guilt of selfishness feeling: for in Gods name I’ve done my share, with pen & talk, for the human race. I mean young writers can stand on their own feet. Yes, I deserve a spring—I owe nobody nothing. Not a letter need I write (there are the poems in MS all waiting) nor need I have week-enders—For others can do that as well as I can, this spring. Now being drowned by the flow of running water, I will read Whymper till lunch time."
1940.03.31,"I would like to tell myself a nice little wild improbable story to spread my wings after this cramped ant-like morning—which I will not detail—for details are the death of me. Thank God, this time next week I shall be free—free of entering M⁠[argery’]⁠s corrections & my own into margins. The story?—oh about the life of a bird, its cheep cheep—its brandishing of a twig by my window—its sensations. Or about Botten becoming one with the mud—the glory fading—the million tinted flowers sent by the doleful mourners. All black like a moving pillar box the woman was—& the man in a black cardboard casing. A story dont come—no but I may unfurl a metaphor—No. The windows very dove grey & dim blue islands—a rust red on L. & V. & the marsh green & dark like the floor of the sea. At the back of my head the string is still wound tight. I will unwind it playing bowls. Then Bobo. And still waxen legs. To carry the virtues of the sketch—its random reaches its happy finds—into the finished work is probably beyond me. Sydney Smith did in talk. Note. To Read P. Plymley. Yes, bare wood spring painted is very fine—flesh pink & elephant grey. Knitting is also a help. Margery says its useless.

Butter all eaten by guests. Asked to meet Tom & Desmond at Hutchinsons. Excitement. Wine. Good food. Old Desmond—shall we go? I wd like to write short book stories. I would like to recapture my own fling.

S⁠[ense]. & S⁠[ensibility]. all scenes, very sharp. Surprises. masterly. Some pedestrian stylised pages, wh. she ends brusquely. The door opened. In came…. Willoughby … or, Edward. Very dramatic. Plot from the 18th Century. Mistressly in her winding up. No flagging. Rather heres an end. And the love so intense, so poignant. And marriage ends all. Sisters love sympathetic. Old Mrs Dashwood the image of—Mrs Curtis? Mrs Easdale?—Elinor I suppose Cassandra: Marianne Jane, edited. Well now for my blue knitting."
1940.04.06,"Whom did we meet in London this week? Bonamy Dobrée the very moment we arrived. Spick & span, clipped, grey, with a rainbow of medal ribbons across his breast. Training cadets at Filey. Keen unconscious young men, very good at their jobs: instinctively patriotic; the rest ‘Bolshies’—I mean the intellectuals. Asked his professional opinion about the war, B. said it might last years. No one can afford to attack. So, unless driven by some goad, there we shall sit: until perhaps food or other shortage drives Hitler to sting. No sign of it so far. All quiet save for spasmodic raids. So, having little to add, we planed down on to civilisation talk: about books, the young, the growth of classes, the origin of biography; Tom’s last poem “didactic”, & he left thanking us for civilisation. Also he mentioned Valentine, & her house keeping; & how her child is in America; & how we all descend the rungs of lady & gentlemanhood. Has inherited from his odd Pawnbroking banking forefathers a great chest of V⁠[ictoria]⁠n Silver.

Then a day in bed with headache. Then to my task again—Thurs; lunch with John: met Worsley; a round mild spectacled brown young man, rubbed, smoothed. No relation of GT’s: now at the N.S: where he tidies Raymond’s table. As we talked we hacked thick steak; Oh said John my woman has a dodge for getting rations. No wonder. Some Bloomsbury cabhorse; & for the first time in my lunching out, I had to exchange for a steak that I could cut—And that with difficulty. Then L. was riddled & needled by Miss Robins for 2 hours. A French clock left by Sir Hugh Bell went on striking. She uncovered her secret after the man from Frodsham had mended it—to leave us the MS of Raymond in her will. I spent one afternoon at the L⁠[ondon] L⁠[ibrary]. looking up quotes. Another buying silk for vests. & we did not dine with the Hutchinsons to meet Tom & Desmond, & how glad I was of the drowsy evening. And so, at 12.45 yesterday handed L. the 2 MSS & we drove off as happy as Bank holiday clerks—Thats off my shoulders! Good or bad—done. So I felt wings on my shoulders: & brooded quietly, till the tire punctured: we had to jackal in mid road; & I was like a stalk, all crumpled, when we got here. And its a keen spring day; infinitely [?] lit & tinted & cold & soft: all the groups of daffodils yellow along the bank; lost my 3 games, & want nothing but sleep. Still, other ideas prick; & Watkins offers £400 (about) for an essay on a character. Brace shies at Roger though “no interest in him in the USA”.

Two days holiday before I begin my lecture. Knitting ties. Reading Sydney Smith. Odd feeling to have done (temporarily) a book. And is it good or dull? And what’ll the old friends say? Never mind that for 3 weeks."
1940.04.13,"“The first crunch of the war”—thats how Winston puts it. The Gs. have invaded Norway. Battles are going on. News leaks out. Some say this is Hitler’s downfall. I must make this record, for in fact it gives the old odd stretch to the back curtain of the mind. A fine spring day in front; daffodils luminous groups along the terrace. Aeroplanes overhead. Mine fields laid, apparently to let us land our army. I write, because it is a crunch; after the long lapse; also that I’m maggoty with lecture writing. Must ease my head. These are my motives. And Nessa rings up about the Roger pictures. Herbert Fisher was knocked senseless, had arm & ribs & skull fractured 2 days ago by a lorry. On Tuesday, London: perhaps Sybil Tom & Desmond. No letters. Mrs Chavasse to tea about the play on Monday. Walking up the violet bank this afternoon. Reading Sydney Smith. Damn this running in the head that comes of lecture writing—cant think why I bother: why I let myself run on—is it suppressed jealousy? partly. Also I’m interested. But surely its excessive to go on making up, when its only 20 old ladies in black bonnets I shall make up for. Dinner in the oven. Meat bad & scarce. Eggs for dinner. Fish for L. maccaroni. And its time"
1940.04.20,"Desmond to dinner [on 18 April]. London week. Talk went like this: “Youre the spit of Sydney Smith—” He said he wanted streets not country. “Must have the muddy London streets—So S.S. said. Oh & there’s so much to talk about. And let me see your fathers shabby old books—Now (at dinner) a few leading questions … about the war. I have a plan for giving G⁠[ermany]. everything, everything: but no arms. We must see to that. And is it impossible? … Then, I must tell you—I’ve told several people—of my revelation. I was reading the Hesperides—the smutty bits—when a voice said August 16th Armistice day … But which August? And I wasnt excited. It was an outer voice. I was thinking of Herrick….” After dinner,—“Michael in an unhappy state. No sense of comfort. Cant love a silly cocktail woman, nor live with a rough woman … The women I’ve loved never cared for clothes. I like quizzy cats. Why all this larding? Even Rachel has a silly row of curls. You wdnt dream of painting your face. Diana [Cooper], after a time, I found in spite of her esquimaux trousers & pearls—oh how ridiculous she looked meeting me at the station—she’s humble. Roger … a very dull letter writer. I’m very curious to read yr book. It’ll be such an odd book. I saw him in Trinity Great Court. Thats R.F. said Eddy Marsh. A gigantic intellect. Its too hot to talk to a man with that intellect … Molly is a lady. Desmond says all the same she enjoys my coarse stories. I’m writing Desmond M⁠[acCarthy’]⁠s Dictionary. Its my autobiography. Under M. marriage, money—easier for a short winded writer than a book … One loses the power of sequence with age. Cant prolong an emotion. The senile forget at once. My daughter dead? (weeps) but why d’you give me marmalade for tea? I only like it at breakfast … I’m noting every stage of old age. Its this lack of intensity the young mind in us. Certain gifts are sucked by age … The Sunday Times has cut me down £250. And my mother only left 11,000. I gave D⁠[ermod]. & M⁠[ichael]. each £1000. So I’m about square. But cd I afford to buy a house in Lewes? Molly wants to have a very nice tidy home. I dont mind squalor. Then I shd have a room in London—a cup of tea sent up, like Morgan … The young can describe passing things—a bridge seen from the train. No. One doesnt remember them. We read Tolstoy. I kept Dos⁠[toevs]⁠ky to myself in my selfish way. They read Jane Austen—Eddie cd say what Mr Woodhouse did on Wednesday. Thats odd about Hugh Walpole—Spender ought to tell us more about Inez—everything or nothing. The idea of being perfectly frank with the public—When is Moore coming? Ask him to stay an extra day. I’ll mark that week end—May 18th in my book. Juliet Duff gave it me—gives me one every year. Oh I’ve stayed so late—¼ to 1…”

And we had Sybil [Colefax] & Herbert Woolf [to tea]. And came back yesterday. I remember Clive saying how he was the only person who felt uncomfortable when a singer had a flybutton undone. I had meant to note some such fragments; but the talk has rattled me.

A stuffy evening. News suspended. Herbert Fisher dead. Sybil saw him the day before—of course."
1940.04.25,"My mother, I was thinking had 2 characters.

I was thinking of my memoirs. The platform of time. How I see father from the 2 angles. As a child condemning; as a woman of 58 understanding—I shd say tolerating. Both views true? Herbert’s death recalls him. The groan. That man will kill me! H. going up to talk in the study. Hearing his wheeze of a laugh on the stairs at night. Essence of a prig—a don, I thought. He came into the day nursery. Advised us to read some shilling shocker. Uneasy condescension. A more friendly memory of a walk at Brighton. I had to choose the way. Chose against his wish. His frock coat. The King coming to Oxford. Uncle H. advising. Cd be pressed. H.’s shyness. How he told Emmy “dont be a fool!” crossing the road, when she screamed. At Oxford when a don. Walking to Bores Hill. He asked me about Trevy’s book. I praised it. He demurred. The same question next year. I denigrated it. He defended—but pleased. His vanity. His advice at the Ilberts’ house. History required special training. I was left alone to consult him. Did I suggest history? or fiction? a serious depressing interview. “H. posts his letters on the school room table.” Then the Cabinet—coming to Hogarth House, discussing action v. contemplation. “I’m not a great hand at writing…” Some uneasy self-consciousness. The Magnolias at Kew. H. looking. And the lunch—the Dutch sweets. “Mr F. at a Cabinet meeting.” A long talk alone about Armistice day. Olive brought him. He stayed. Told me about Milner. The war won today. So to the last social meeting at New College. The party. His light cats tread. His hollow benevolence. His shell. His affection. His considerateness. His enthusiasm. Father & Fred. His stories. Warmer & mellower—asking me to come again. Gave me Homer, gave me his books. But the distance too great. & so—I shant give him the pleasure—never went there. And thats over.

Herbert Fisher as a young man was almost ungainly: with his prominent cheekbones & adams apple. He had innocent blue eyes: a wisp of hair. Much improved in dignity & distinction as he aged. Finally the very type of culture & distinction—light in a pea jacket. Composed, ben⁠[ev]⁠olent, wary. A crane like man. Much like Adrian.

Butterflies ball day 3 days ago. Cuckoo heard. Swallows come.

Advertisements: For 16 years housekeeper & faithful friend … Note the doglike attribute.

There is nothing in the world so much admired as a man who knows how to bear unhappiness with courage. Seneca.

Lady, formerly supported by brother, Army Colonel … in urgent need as only income gifts from former servant."
1940.05.06,"Nessa has just been & told us a ‘very tiresome piece of family news’—A.’s affair with B. (I keep to the discretion of initials). A most astonishing piece of news. Today they set off for 2 months alone in Yorkshire. Pray God she may tire of that rusty surly slow old dog with his amorous ways & his primitive mind. It makes one feel oddly old: even to me comes the emptiness that Nessa feels, as I can guess. A. off alone in love, passionately, with someone old eno’ to be her father. How curiously without youth & laughter; Julian’s death renewed—And what can she be feeling, in the train to Yorkshire this sullen May night? All the nightingales singing from that rusty canine jaw? And the future? I prognosticate an excuse to return in 5 weeks from now. A scene with B.: then a happy summer here, half repentant, as when she gave up the stage.

This blocks the way to my crowded London diary, & reduces it to fribble & patter. Clive’s night: the police; & Mary’s visit; the Duke of Devonshire & his midnight daffodils; Clive’s unshaven cheeks; Desmond next day—all this I leave like torn scraps in a wastepaper basket. Item my tea with Hugh; the fall of Fatty [Claude] Rogers’ picture; Hart Davis fresh from Peter Fleming [1907-71, travel writer]; the sulphurous vista of the Green Park; the traffic; Hugh’s sodomitic confession of affection; our intimacy interrupted; then Raymond; & little soft round Worsley’s discourse on the young [?]—which should bring in my lecture; 200 about there; Robins’ carnations; no fear on my part—& so home, last Friday, jaded & jangled, with my proofs—& this evenings work blown up, by this explosion of love; & the dream of the Yorkshire moors, & those two setting the supper in order, & retiring to the couch. Nothing will induce her to marry. So the land recedes from my ship which draws out into the sea of old age. The land with its children.

And we have withdrawn from Norway. The first defeat of the war. Hawhaw has it all his own way. Nessa advises us to prognosticate about that. Compare Maynard’s optimism 3 weeks ago. War practically over … Kingsley of course croaks in triumph. Another lull.

In London we had Wogan & Stephen: then Stephen again with his last poems at 12 am. His book [The Backward Son] sneered at; I praised it. John—well, Mrs L⁠[ehmann]. has broken her thigh. The cold is such I shall have my wood fire. Wrote to GBS this evening.

The worst year we’ve ever had in the Press, I gather.

An old tramp comes to grind scissors. I give him 2, & then reflect—should I spend 1/8 on scissors? This money anxiety contracts & loosens. Oh & I’ve forgotten I think Vita’s visit [on 23 April], & can only assure whoever may read this page that we’ve seen & talked a great deal, & I’ve laboured over my wretched book, unable to strangle my conscience or to write one line as I write here—for the 2 weeks that have passed since I described Herbert’s death—about which Mary, by the way, was highly philosophic. But there’s no Angelica to hoard gossip for.

Its odd how much I thought of that lecture, & now its all forgotten—the agony & the sweat & the old man praising me, & the tea at Fullers, & the man in tweed with the whore, so L. called her."
1940.05.23,"I admit to some content, some closing of a chapter, & peace that comes with it, from posting my proofs today: I admit—because we’re in the 3rd day of “the greatest battle in history.” It began (here) with the 8 oclock wireless announcing, as I lay half asleep, the invasion of Holland & Belgium. The third day of the Battle of Waterloo. Apple blossom snowing the garden. A bowl lost in the pond. Churchill exhorting all men to stand together. “I have nothing to offer but blood & tears & sweat”. These vast formless shapes further circulate. They aren’t substances; but they make everything else minute. Duncan saw an air battle over Charleston—a silver pencil & a puff of smoke. Percy has seen the wounded arriving in their boots. So my little moment of peace comes in a yawning hollow. But though L. says he has petrol in the garage for suicide shd. Hitler win, we go on. Its the vastness, & the smallness, that make this possible. So intense are my feelings (about Roger): yet the circumference (the war) seems to make a hoop round them. No, I cant get the odd incongruity of feeling intensely & at the same time knowing that there’s no importance in that feeling. Or is there, as I sometimes think, more importance than ever?

Basket given us by the WEA—then G. & Annie⁠[?]. A horrid little scrub called Lee wastes a morning, about Curtis. Q. & Eth Watson dine. And we have Desmond & Moore this week end. I made buns for tea today—a sign my thralldom to proofs (galleys) is over."
1940.05.14,"Yes, we are being led up garlanded to the altar. A soldier with his rifle. The Dutch Govt & Court here. Warned of clergymen in parachutes. War war—a great battle—this hot day, with the blossom on the grass. A plane goes over—"
1940.05.15,"An appeal last night for home defence—against parachutists. L. says he’ll join. An acid conversation. Our nerves are harassed—mine at least: L. evidently relieved by the chance of doing something. Gun & uniform to me slightly ridiculous. Behind that the strain: this morning we discussed suicide if Hitler lands. Jews beaten up. What point in waiting? Better shut the garage doors. This a sensible, rather matter of fact talk. Then he wrote letters, & I too: thanked Bernard Shaw for his love letter. Copied my lecture contentedly. A thunderous hot day. Dutch laid down arms last night. The great battle now raging. Ten days, we say, will settle it. I guess we hold: then dig in; about Nov. the USA comes in as arbitrator. On the other hand—

Mabel just come. She says theyre building wooden bridges beside the others on the Thames. Pop-pop-pop, as we play bowls. Probably a raider over Eastbourne way. Now thunder rain sets in. L. & P⁠[ercy] discussing Miss Emery’s fruit. John wishes we’d come up. Mr Pritchard (the old one) dead at last. No, I dont want the garage to see the end of me. I’ve a wish for 10 years more, & to write my book wh. as usual darts into my brain. L. finished his yesterday. So we’ve cleared up our book accounts—tho’ its doubtful if we shall publish this June. Why am I optimistic? Or rather not either way? because its all bombast, this war. One old lady pinning on her cap has more reality. So if one dies, it’ll be a common sense, dull end—not comparable to a days walk, & then an evening reading over the fire. Hospital trains go by. A hot day to be wounded. Anyhow, it cant last, this intensity—so we think—more than 10 days. A fateful book this. Still some blank pages—& what shall I write on the next 10?

This idea struck me: the army is the body: I am the brain. Thinking is my fighting."
1940.05.20,"This idea was meant to be more impressive. It bobbed up I suppose in one of the sentient moments. The war is like desperate illness. For a day it entirely obsesses; then the feeling faculty gives out; next day one is disembodied, in the air. Then the battery is re-charged, & again—what? Well, the bomb terror. Going to London to be bombed. And the catastrophe—if they break through: Channel this morning said to be their objective. Last night Churchill asked us to reflect, when being bombed, that we were at least drawing fire from the soldiers for once.

Desmond & Moor⁠[e] are at this moment reading—i.e. talking under the apple trees. A fine windy morning. Moor⁠[e] has a thatch of soft unattached hair: red rimmed eyes, very steady; but less force & mass to him than I remembered. Less drive behind his integrity which is unalloyed, but a little weakened in thrust by the sense of age (65) & not quite such a solid philosophic frame as I suppose when we were all young we anticipated. So that our reverence—how mute I was at the Sangers—how timidly I ventured my little compliment—is now what one might call retrospective. At tea yesterday with Nessa & Quentin we remembered his great influence: his silences. “I didnt want to be silent. I couldnt think of anything to say” he said, rebutting, I think with some feeling that he’d carried this influence too far—our charge that he had silenced his generation. Hence his dependence on Desmond; who started talking, to the towel horse, to the cat, when he was a baby, & was sent to school to silence him. Many old memories. These spin a kind of gauze over the war: wh. is broken by papers: & at listening in time. The war then is waged vigorously till I throw Coleridge into the fire: & it takes another leap. D. & I discussed Irene; & some of the old anecdotes of course appear intact. A good talker makes his toilet of a morning much as a Mary Hutchinson makes up. Word for word we had the definition of age; wh. I think I recorded after our dinner. What is impressive however, are the improvisations. I like hearing Desmond give his first version—say of—I forget—on the spur of the moment. Nessa & I sat & talked here (the Lodge) while they bowld. Politics—the peace terms—how the young havent had a chance—Even we. She knitting Q.’s grey stockings: will have a show at the Leicester Galleries. Then to London the whole lot of us tomorrow; & on Friday here again. Roger & the proofs have entirely receded; nor can I tackle Walpole—havent even read the book; & its ¼ to 12: then lunch: extravagant guinea fowl; Moor⁠[e] munches like a chaff cutter; I guess has not a liberal table at home; takes a logical view of food; eats philosophically to the end: while Desmond sprinkles sugar & cream, also liberally but erratically. So the housekeeper in me rises into being, in this miserable life of detail & bombast."
1940.05.25,"Then we went up to what has been so far the worst week in the war. And so remains. On Tuesday evening, after my freshener, before Tom & Wm. P. came, the BBC announced the taking of Amiens & Arras. The French PM told the truth & knocked all our “holding” to atoms. On Monday they broke through. Its tedious picking up details. It seems they raid with tanks & parachutists: roads crammed with refugees cant be bombed. They crash on. Now are at Boulogne. But it also seems these occupations arent altogether solid. What are the great armies doing to let this 25 mile hole stay open? The feeling is we’re outwitted. Theyre agile & fearless & up to any new dodge. The French forgot to blow up Bridges. The G.s seem youthful, fresh, inventive. We plod behind. This went on the 3 London days. The party (Tuesday) agreed to ignore. William told a story about Mrs Hyde Colville’s camellia hat being burnt as a wreath at a cremation. Tom, I thought, is ossifying (after Desmond’s geniality) into that curious writers egotism. “Coleridge & I … people read only our best poems. They ignore all the rest of me. It is difficult, when lecturing, to leave out oneself. Yet poor man if this complacency gives him a shell, no doubt it protects him from suffering. A very self centred, self torturing & self examining man, seen against Desmond’s broad beam, & Moore’s candid childs eyes.

Then I had Sybil: & noted her—what in another would be heroism: her son at Arras: she working all day: yet has so much fluid worldliness, & something hard at bottom that one doesnt credit her with enough of her courage. “We’re all in it” she said; simply; yet then curled & shrivelled, because we had had D. & M. & she had been talking to the respectable Cynthia Asquith. Envy writhes at once. Then there was the mad Kot: all his hair brushed up; heavy, yellow, bloodshot. To begin with he told us the story of a Tolstoy. It struck me he lives in what he reads: makes it do instead of living. Then fabricates what he calls a theology. From that he turned to Gertler: his suicide. Has become opinionated & violent. But his madness was about the war. He seemed raving. He seemed almost drunk. All the old rage with Murry is now with Fascists. All Germans are devils. We must kill every one. Then some hare brained scheme. Smoking his expensive cigarettes. And his handshake as crushing as ever—as positive. But something gone queer—a screw loose. He gets up at 6 to listen to the BBC at 7. is obsessed—brooding alone at Acacia Road. Does his own housework, & denounces, lays down the law. Had lectured Gertler about his son.

Rodmell burns with rumours. Are we to be bombed, evacuated? Guns that shake the windows. Hospital ships sunk. So it comes our way.

Todays rumour is the Nun in the bus who pays her fare with a mans hand."
1940.05.28,"And today at 8, the French P.M. Broadcast the treachery of the Belgian King. The Belgians have capitulated. The Government is not capitulating. Churchill to broadcast at 4. A wet dull day."
1940.05.29,"But hope revives—I dont know why. A desperate battle. The allies holding. How sick one gets of the phrase—how easy to make a Duff Cooper speech, about valour, & history, where one knows the end of the sentence. Still it cheers, somehow. Poetry as Tom said is easier to write than prose. I cd reel off patriotic speeches, by the dozen. L. has been in London. A great thunderstorm. I was walking on the marsh & thought it was the guns on the channel ports. Then, as they swerved, I conceived a raid on London; turned on the wireless; heard some prattler; & then the guns began to lighten: then it rained. Mrs Dedman off north for the duration. We had our First Aid meeting. Miss Emery English country spinsterhood at its best: sturdy, yet conciliatory, lucid, humorous, with a bar of medal tabs. Everything spaced, brief & clear. L. said the English genius for unofficial organisation. All about the Water Co. & the tap & the Rectory scullery—very tactful too. Mrs Hubbard, like a great turkey cock, head of the committee. Hubbard limping outside. Then the [W.I.] plays rehearsed here yesterday. My contribution to the war is the sacrifice of pleasure: I’m bored: bored & appalled by the readymade commonplaceness of these plays: which they cant act unless we help. I mean, the minds so cheap, compared with ours, like a bad novel—thats my contribution—to have my mind smeared by the village & WEA mind; & to endure it, & the simper. But this is to be qualified—only theres Miss Griffiths [Hogarth Press clerk] coming for the weekend—all simper & qualification. So, if Margaret Ll. Davies says, how insolent we middleclass women are, I argue, why cant the workers then reject us? Whats wrong is the conventionality—not the coarseness. So that its all lulled & dulled. The very opposite of “common” or working class.

Began P.H again today, & threshed & threshed till perhaps a little grain can be collected. I sent off my Walpole too. After dinner I began Sidney Smith; plan being to keep short flights going: P.H. in between. Oh yes—one cant plan, any more, a long book. H. Brace cable that they accept Roger—whom, which, I’d almost forgotten. So thats a success; where I’d been expecting failure. It cant be so bad as all that. 250 advance. But we shall I suppose certainly postpone. Reading masses of Coleridge & Wordsworth letters of a night—curiously untwisting & burrowing into that plaited nest. Withers Green cant sleep for thinking of raids. No news of Louie’s brother [Harry West]. Rumours about Gwyn’s wounds & Col. Westmacott. They’re fully furbished in 5 minutes. Rain—& purple & now its over—clear over Caburn & the birds shouting. A rill of sound—a flutter of ribands—no continuity or connection with each other. Reading Thomas A’Quinas [1933] by Chesterton. His skittish over ingenious mind makes one shy (like a horse). Not straightforward, but has a good engine in his head. I want to send out parachutes into these remote places—I cant find the word I want.—prospectors, perhaps?"
1940.05.30,"Walking today (Nessa’s birthday) by Kingfisher pool saw my first hospital train—laden, not funereal, but weighty, as if not to shake bones. Something what is the word I want: grieving & tender & heavy laden & private—bringing our wounded back carefully through the green fields at which I suppose some looked. Not that I could see them. And the faculty for seeing in imagination always leaves me so suffused with something partly visual partly emotional, I can’t though its very pervasive, catch it when I come home—the slowness, cadaverousness, grief of the long heavy train, taking its burden through the fields. Very quietly it slid into the cutting at Lewes. Instantly wild duck flights of aeroplanes came over head; manoeuvred; took up positions & passed over Caburn. Percy has seen Westmacot⁠[t]’s man, home on leave, very thin, drawn & aged; says its a hell: was at Arras: all had to fight. And the same stories as the papers about the brutality to refugees. Mrs Dedman is off north. Louie worried & sad. Her mother cant stand the strain now the boys are gone, alone with the chattering idiot. A Mrs Ayres, who loves my books, called, to suggest a mental home. Mrs West has made up her mind to become a nurse & let him go. So whats to become of father, Louie asks, whose nerves are bad? This is a pinch of Hitler in the cottages of Rodmell too. No news today. Holding the line—heroism—all the usual perorations, in the usual highflown tense voice. Oh for a speaking voice, once in a way—not Harold’s though, which disgusted me Armies retreating unbroken in spite of uncovered left wing as well as Mr McLaren. “Does Mr Nicolson speak before or after dinner?—” Like the imposition of personality in writing—say Meredith’s style, or Carlyle’s, when one wants facts. And being beaten at bowls irritates me; & I’m strained writing PH—so much more of a strain than Roger. And no meat today. And weeded this morning. And was very happy—the moment can be that: only theres no support in the fabric—if you see what I mean, as Charlie Sanger used to say—theres no healthy tissue round the moment. It’s blown out. But for a moment, on the terrace, no one coming, alone with L., ones certainly happy. And I like the windblown state of ones body in the open air—wind, warm wind washing all the crevices, a feeling one doesnt have in London, an air cleanliness, not a soap & water one."
1940.05.31,"Scraps, orts & fragments, as I said in PH. which is now bubbling—I’m playing with words; & think I owe some dexterity to finger exercises here—but the scraps: Louie has seen Mr Westmacot’s man: “Its an eyesore”—his description of fighting near Boulogne. Percy weeding: “I shall conquer ’em in the end. If I was sure of our winning the other battle…” Raid, said to be warned, last night. All the searchlights in extreme antennal vibration. They have blots of light, like beads of dew on a stalk. Mr Hanna ‘stood by’ half the night. Rumour, very likely: rumour wh. has transported the English in Belgium who, with their golf sticks ball & some nets in a car coming from Flanders, were taken for parachutists: condemned to death, released; & returned to Seaford. Rumour, via Percy, transplanted them to “somewhere near Eastbourne” & the villagers armed with rifles, pitchforks etc. Shows what a surplus of unused imagination we possess. We—the educated—check it: as I checked my cavalry on the down at Telscombe & transformed them into cows drinking. Making up again. So that I couldnt remember, coming home, if I’d come by the mushroom path or the field. How amazing that I can tap that old river again; & how satisfying. But will it last? I made out the whole of the end; & need only fill in; the faculty, dormant under the weight of Roger, springs up. And to me its the voice on the scent again. “Any waste paper?” here I was interrupted by the jangling bell. Small boy in white sweater come, I suppose, for Scouts, & Mabel says they pester us daily at 37, & make off with the spoils. Desperate fighting. The same perorations. Coming through Southease I saw Mrs Cockell in old garden hat weeding. Out comes a maid in muslin apron & cap tied with blue ribband. Why? To keep up standards of civilisation? I also heard a pick-pick as I passed Mount Misery, & crouched low under the thick hedge of cow parlsey & saw the scrub—Lee—risked rudeness, & marched on. Land girls weeding in the field by the river. One elegant in blue trousers & green head band; the other a dumpy elderly spinster, with a vast bottom in knickerbockers. Two more, with hairdressed hair, among the Dedman, Wests & Thompsett men. Began Balzac, Vautrin."
1940.06.03,"Leonard said, after Miss Griffiths went, “If it gives them so much happiness, we ought to put up with it from time to time”. I said, But how, seeing she never spoke & was as unresponsive as a fish, could it have given her pleasure? “She leads such an awful life in Acton. She likes the food & sitting in a garden.” This fairly sums up a very laboured week end; when we drew bucket up after bucket & nothing happened. Acton is noisy. She lives with an Aunt and a grandmother who forgets things, & they have gas. But we made her sing, Monteverdi: & she sang quite simply. Will she marry? or fade? Again I’m struck with the helplessness of the lower orders. All of us on top. What can they get at—? Louie said this morning “The Duke of Northumberland has been killed”. I had a sense of a very heavy tree fallen. A young man so loaded with everything to be lopped. A kind of crash it seemed, for a duke to fall, compared with a Harry West. I was woken by a great boom rattling my windows. Listened for another; none came. But 2 bombs were dropped “in Sussex”. Buttercups & sorrel week end—the very flush of the first summer. May still in but bruised: a tossing wind today; none yesterday. Poor little Griffiths looking at the evening. So quiet after Acton.

Nessa & Duncan & Q. over on Saturday. We discussed Helen. D. said, She’s not intimate eno’ with you to be honest about money. Then A. & B.—how discreet! D. can only say to him Pass the salt—He would not begin upon his anger, as I expressed mine. Nessa said, One must look on the good side. She might have loved an airman. She has an odd streak of luck. Then the weekend descended. I’ve just only just been beaten at bowls. Breakfast was at 7.30. And this time tomorrow shall I or not be having cocktails with Colefax? I think so yes: in order to discipline myself. Only clothes? gloves? stockings? 4 5ths of the army over here now. A respite, a pause, perhaps. Perhaps Italy comes in … Then what about Roger? No proofs. We have now been hard at it hero-making. The laughing, heroic, Tommy—how can we be worthy of such men?—every paper, every BBC rises to that dreary false cheery hero-making strain. Will they be grinding organs in the street in 6 months? Its the emotional falsity; not all false; yet inspired with some eye to the main chance. So the politicians mate guns & tanks. No. Its the myth making stage of the war we’re in. “Please, no letters” I read this twice in the Times Deaths column from parents of dead officers."
1940.06.07,"Just back this roasting hot evening. The great battle which decides our life or death goes on. Last night an air raid here. Today brittle [?] hard sparks. Up till 1.30 this morning, Kingsley, diffusing his soft charcoal gloom. Question of suicide seriously debated among the 4 of us—R. Macaulay the other—in the gradually darkening room. At last no light at all. This was symbolic. French are to be beaten; invasion here; 5th Coin active; a German pro-Consul; Engsh Govt in Canada; we in concentration camps, or taking sleeping draughts. The menace now is Ireland. K.M. gives us about 5 weeks before the great attack on Engld begins. I will continue tomorrow when less sleepy. Saw Stephen, Sybil, John, Morgan, Judith, Raymond, K.M. Rose Macaulay, finally W. Robson—but cant discriminate"
1940.06.09,"I will continue—but can I? The pressure of this battle wipes out London pretty quick. A gritting day. As sample of my present mood, I reflect: capitulation will mean all Jews to be given up. Concentration camps. So to our garage. Thats behind correcting Roger, playing bowls. One taps any source of comfort—Leigh Ashton at Ch⁠[arlesto]⁠n yesterday for instance. But today the line is bulging. Last night aeroplanes (G?) over: shafts of light following. I papered my windows.

Another reflection: I dont want to go to bed at midday: this refers to the garage. What we dread (its no exaggeration) is the news that the French Govt. have left Paris. A kind of growl behind the cuckoo & t’other birds: a furnace behind the sky. It struck me that one curious feeling is, that the writing ‘I’, has vanished. No audience. No echo. Thats part of one’s death. Not altogether serious, for I correct Roger: send finally I hope tomorrow: & could finish P.H. But it is a fact—this disparition of an echo."
1940.06.10,"A day off. I mean one of those odd lapses of anxiety which may be false. Anyhow they said this morning that the line is unbroken—save at certain points. And our army has left Norway & is going to their help. Anyhow—its a day off—a coal gritty day. L. breakfasted by electric light. And cool mercifully after the furnace. Today, too, I sent off my page proofs, & thus have read my Roger for the last time. The Index remains. And I’m in the doldrums; a little sunk, & open to the suggestion, conveyed by the memory of Leonard’s coolness, enforced by John’s silence, that its one of my failures. Reading it as closely as I did, I couldn’t generalise the whole. I think it has a certain completeness; but I also think there are patches of anal; too much quotation; sometimes its cramped & poky. Thats about all I can lay hands on at the moment. The after book stage is on me.

Now to record a funny little—what shall I call it?—snag in my Elizabeth Bowen relationship. I decided, as my October letter went unanswered, & as Rose said she’d seen her, to take that little bull by the horns & telephone; she was out. So I sent a card, asking if we could meet. No answer today. If there’s no answer at all, then that friendships over. But why? Cant conceive. But as I cant go on writing, over it must be. And indeed, its not so petty a snag; for I was fond of her; & I think she of me. And we could talk seriously. And she’s the only one of the younger generation of women … But whats the use of asking what can have happened? Some gossip? Some mischief making? But as I never said a word, or saw any go between,—again, whats the use? If she’s dumb, one of these days I’ll ask David Cecil. Thats my little snag.

Now I must at once forage, & busy myself. Raymond, who is leaving the NS for the M. of Information, sends me Haryo. I’m not in the mood for memoirs. What next? Darwin? Mme de Stael? It must be solid, yet short. I must put my head to the gallop, so as to cover these weeks. PH can be finished. And my Sketch of the Past continued. Some experiment I think. The old book of critical excursion, perhaps … Yes, an experiment not a drudge."
1940.06.21,"Today or yesterday Italy came in: French said to be holding most lines; Govt offices leaving Paris; no letter from Eth Bowen; plays rehearsed, working till eyes blind at Index.

A slaty queasy feeling about E.B. discussed it with L. What a time to quarrel with friends. Wound to vanity & affection."
1940.06.12,"Black news. French apparently withdrawing but only guarded news. Maurois begging for help last night. Percy says the little boats all summoned again, as if to fetch off more troops. Mrs Richardson (Lady Reading’s gardeners wife [of Southease]) told me of a friend of her husbands dead on the beach at Dunkirk—not a wound—shock. The West boy [Harry] writes he’s hunting his battalion—no clothes—won’t go back he says; but gives no word of his wounds. Some say hes the only survivor of his regiment. Landed in a sailing boat at Ramsgate. Twined in with all this—& the fine weather—& the drill & drone of the planes at night—& Mabel here—& my long long Index making—twined in is E. Bowen: who dont answer, & is I suspect to be written off henceforth. Why? Is she a touchy? Is she a lover of rows? Really I dont know her well enough to diagnose. And how soon anger & sternness & complete disregard for this sort of twittering triviality come to one’s help. I’m not wounded in my vanity, for I cant play those games. So have drafted a letter, & shall send it on Friday—for I’m almost sure, in my bones, as L. wd say, that she’s set on a break. If the Index is finished tomorrow, thats the very last load home. Whether we publish or not, I’m quit.

No letters of any sort: & no Times book: but all the same I feel decks cleared & scrubbed, & can set to, in a jiffy—oh dear, I’ve not thanked Shaw—yes, I’ll write all my letters tomorrow. I was asked to write a life of Margaret Bondfield—I forgot to say: also to contribute to some Womens Symposium in USA; and Judith is the only one to get a First."
1940.06.13,"I should love to see you—would you be in &c—Elizabeth. Let that abstract of this mornings postcard be a reminder & a warning about mares nests & jumping to conclusions & feeling in ones bones—not but what I had some justification. If it werent for—oh dear the retreat—Paris now almost besieged—20,000 of our men cut off—still the Fr. have gained 5 miles somewhere—if it werent for this—today wd have been a happy day. Elizabeth to begin with, which warmed & consoled, for if one’s friends are to die in the flesh now, whats left?—Then Dotty’s Yeats book with her praise of Virginia; then the milkman with 400 eggs for sale. We have bought two great crocks & glass water, or whats it called. My Index sent off—so thats the very final full stop to all that drudgery. John rang up yesterday to say he’s been offered a job at India Office, wh., foreboding as it does Mrs N. & Miss H. here, if evacuated, greatly increased my private gloom. Indeed, after we’d heard Haw-Haw, objectively announcing defeat—victory on his side of the line that is—again & again, left us about as down as we’ve yet been. We sat silent in the 9 o’clock dusk; & L. could only with difficulty read Austen Chamberlain. I found the Wordsworth letters my only drug. Yet today we’re again publicly more cheerful. Why? Up & down—up & down. No petrol at the pumps—providing for Invasion, only served a dribble, the man said."
1940.06.14,"Paris is in the hands of the Germans. Battle continues. We spent the day seeing Penshurst with Vita—picnicked in the park. Gwen in military dress—V. in trousers. Very fine & hot. The house of yellowish Oxford stone. Banqueting hall: disappointing furniture, like heavy & over ornamental Tot Court Rd. only made 1314—Q. Elizth dancing—tilted up by Essex? Ladies & gents all sitting on the benches laughing. Elizabeth herself in another picture, delicate skinned red haired, aquiline. Then the shell of Lady Pembroke’s lute—like half a fig. Then Sidney’s shaving glass. Then some very ugly tables … a long panelled room with soft veined panels. Out into the garden, which has certain trim lawns, & long grass walks, then lapses into wilderness. Sidneys very poor—given up weeding. A great lily pond; the goldfish making an odd subacqueous tapping as they moved among reeds. Then through old pink courtyards, with the Boar & the broad arrow to the car: but the butler came & said his. Lordship wanted to see us. Vita went—we stayed. Then were summoned. Ld. de Lisle & Dudley is like a very old liver & white Sussex spaniel—heavy pouched, both eyes with cataract, 87 but looks younger, waistcoat undone. Glad of company. Easy going at his ease, loose limbed, twinkling. “Do you mind if I say it—but the statue of the Q. outside Buck Palace is like a lady on a close stool—Showed that (Q. Charlotte) to Queen Mary. She didnt like it when I said it was like her.” Padded us into a small room; made us look at pictures said to be good—one, skied, of A. Sidney. Then a reputed Rembrandt. Can only keep a few rooms open. And those like seaside lodging rooms—There we left him alone, blind, with his shilling box of cork tipped cigarettes, some patience or other game, a few novels, & the photographs of his nephew “—a very nice boy” & his grey lady the only signs of youth, on a side table. Vita said he’d told her he was so poor he couldnt have people to stay: whole place run by 2 maids & a boy & butler; is alone—but d’you mind being alone? she asked. “Hate it” he said. Twice a week he goes to Tonbridge & plays Bridge. There this old snail sits in the corner of his tremendous shell. The taste of the present Sidneys is all for carved tables & yellow varnish. He had hardly any fingers when we shook hands, each thanking him, & he was anxious to give us tea. But I must get back for my fire practice Gwen said. Whats the use? he remarked. Odd to have seen this Elizabethan great house the first day that invasion becomes serious. But I like MH better."
1940.06.20,"London diary: just back; & dinner so close & events so crowded that I must abstract. Monday lunch: John. The French stopped fighting: whats to become of me? Offered a Roumanian bookshop. Then what about Press? KM. after dinner. Now we suffer what the Poles suffered. Fight in our fortress: are conquered: I have my morphia in pocket. Tuesday, dine with Adrian. They both off to air raid rehearsal at Middlesex hospl. Adrian promises us a prescription. Ch⁠[urchi]⁠ll broadcasts. Reassuring about defence of England; not all claptrap. Now we’re fighting alone with our back to the wall. Bombs first, then invasion. Ethel Smyth tea. Oh of course we shall fight and win. Then Wednesday. Mrs N⁠[icholls]. & daughter fled from air raid at Thetford. Tea with her & Eth Bowen. In comes L.: air raid practice at H. of C. Those are the skeleton facts of our 3 London days. Monday ended in charcoal gloom. KM. says we must & shall be beaten. He says perhaps 4 more numbers of NS will come out.

Here, as soon as we begin bowls, Louie comes agog. Harry came back on Monday. It pours out—how he hadnt boots off for 3 days; the beach at Dunkirk—the bombers as low as trees—the bullets like moth holes in his coat—how no English aeroplanes fought; how the officer told them to take their shoes off & go past a pill box on all fours. Then went himself with a grenade & blasted it. At Dunkirk many men shot themselves as the planes swooped. Harry swam off, a boat neared. Say Chum Can you row? Yes, he said, hauled in, rowed for 5 hours, saw England, landed—didnt know if it were day or night or what town—didnt ask—couldn’t write to his mother—so was despatched to his regiment. He looted a Belgian shop & stuffed his pockets with rings, which fell out in the sea; but 2 watches pinned to his coat survived: one is chased, & chimes. Mrs Everest has them. He saw his cousin dead on the beach; & another man from the street. He was talking to a chap, who showed him a silk handkerchief bought for his joy lady. That moment a bomb killed him. Harry took the handkerchief. Harry has had eno’ war, & is certain of our defeat—got no arms & no aeroplanes—how can we do anything?"
1940.06.22,"Is Harry the real animal behind the brave, laughing heroic boy panoply which the BBC spreads before us nightly?—[omission] a natural human being, not made for shooting men, but for planting potatoes, [omission] And is he, as I suspect, the average sample? I gather he’d shoot himself rather than go to France again. And he hates the French, who gabble & become hysterical & run mad; & yet dont give him little loaves for nothing like the nice Belgian woman. So it was at Waterloo I suppose. And the fighting goes on in France; & the terms aren’t yet public; & its a heavy grey day, & I’ve been beaten at bowls, feel depressed & irritated, & vow I’ll play no more, but read my book.

My book is Coleridge; Rose Macaulay; the Bessborough Lord Moynihan’s life; letters—rather a foolish flight inspired by Hary-o; I would like to find one book & stick to it. But cant. I feel, if this is my last lap, oughtn’t I to read Shakespeare? But cant. I feel oughtn’t I to finish off P.H.: oughtn’t I to finish something by way of an end? The end gives its vividness, even its gaiety & recklessness to the random daily life. This, I thought yesterday, may be my last walk. On the down above Bugdean I found some green glass tubes. The corn was flowing with poppies in it. And I read my Shelley at night. How delicate & pure & musical & uncorrupt he & Coleridge read, after the left wing group. How lightly & firmly they put down their feet, & how they sing; & how they compact; & fuse, & deepen. I wish I cd invent a new critical method—something swifter & lighter & more colloquial & yet intense: more to the point & less composed; more fluid & following the flight, than my C.R. essays. The old problem: how to keep the flight of the mind, yet be exact. All the difference between the sketch & the finished work. And now dinner to cook. A role.

Nightly raids on the east & south coast. 6, 3, 12 people killed nightly."
1940.06.27,"How difficult to make oneself a centre after all the rings a visitor stirs in one—in this case E. Bowen. How difficult to draw in from all those wide ripples & be at home, central. I tried to center by reading Freud. These rough rapid twinkling ripples spread out & out—for some hours after EB is in the train. It is a disagreeable after-visit feeling. It has its connection too with too many cigarettes, with incessant knitting. A high wind was blowing; Mabel & Louie picking currants & gooseberries. Then a visit to Charleston. Threw another stone into the pond. And at the moment, with PH only to fix upon, I’m loosely anchored. Further, the war—our waiting while the knives sharpen for the operation—has taken away the outer wall of security. No echo comes back. I have no surroundings. I have so little sense of a public that I forget about Roger coming or not coming out. Those familiar circumvolutions—those standards—which have for so many years given back an echo & so thickened my identity are all wide & wild as the desert now. I mean, there is no ‘autumn’ no winter. We pour to the edge of a precipice … & then? I cant conceive that there will be a 27th June 1941. This cuts away something even at tea at Charleston. We drop another afternoon into the millrace. Clive sullen, & effort ridden. Duncan patched & peeled like an onion. He fell down stairs. Then Bunny as bluff & burly & beefy as a Farmer lurches in with Angelica. A clock ticks somewhere. Nothing said.

And so, in this high wind, we reach the present moment; & I find it difficult to centre. I think I must force a C.R. essay into being. E.’s stammer also had a disintegrating effect: like a moth buzzing round a flower—her whirr of voice as she cant alight on a word—a whirr of sound that makes the word quiver & seem blurred. We talked however—& very on the whole congenially. But having spent my words on analysing the central, & being apprehensive that Judith will come & smash [?] me again, I do not record what we said. A very honourable horse faced, upper class hard [?] constricted mind."
1940.07.04,"Again, back from London. But its here that the events take place. Louie, toothless, but all agog: yesterday at 5 pm. pop, pop pop out over the marshes. She was picking fruit. Backfiring she thought. Told by someone it was a raid. So she went in. They bombed the train at Newhaven: the driver died this morning. Passengers lay under seats. Rails wrecked. Today a plane—ours—crashed at Southease. So, the Germans are nibbling at my afternoon walks. The French fleet has been seized & sunk. All Lewes listening to the wireless. Mr Uridge, of whom I bought butter, says the PM “made a strong speech. Now we’re getting to business”. Indeed the fleet capture is the first good news since—Narvik? In London K.M. decreed that Tuesday, or today, Thursday, was fixed for invasion. London very safe & solid in feeling. Pink brick fortresses—for ammunition?—in main streets. Wire mazes in Whitehall &c. We passed strings of ambulances coming down tagged with boughs. Canadians swarm—want to see Buck Palace. Theres dinner: so private life must be postponed."
1940.07.05,"Why should I be bothering myself with Coleridge I wonder—Biog. Lit. & then with father’s essay on Coleridge, this fine evening, when the flies are printing their cold little feet on my hands? It was in order to give up thinking about economy; whether to give up Mable. I wanted to think myself up into calmness. Economy, means that I must make money: thus when Dotty offers me £50 for an essay upon fiction, 10,000 words, I cut it up into articles, & reckon; no: thats poor pay. I’d better finish Pointz Hall.

I took my Times [Book Club] order to the post & there met Mrs Ebbs. “So Mr Woolf has seen Monks House again!” she said. I of course said, “but you’ve been having fighting here.” Then she told me how the cups rattled in her hand, at tea, at Seaford, when the raider was fired at, & brought down at sea. “The poor fellow, the engine driver was killed between Newhaven & Seaford” she said. Also that the silly fellow who crashed his plane on the marsh, tipped its nose over the brook: He didnt know about the brooks. So I walked down & saw it—a little gnat, with red & white & blue bars; a tent keeping guard. Louie said that Audrey Hubbard who was in the pea field ran to give first aid. The man had a face like two faces. She made him write his name on a cigarette card: he was taken to Lewes, & has lockjaw. But this is rumour—rumour, via Percy, has it that the streets of Newhaven were machine gunned. L. gets annoyed with Percy. I see the imagination—that should have turned a wheel, running to waste & foam instead. L. back from the Library with a great volume of Gifford’s Laws. So to bowls. The French Fleet fought: Petain cuts off diplomatic relations. So shall we be at war with our ally? Last month indissolubly determined to fight to the end.

If someone comes in one writes differently: now, having been beaten at bowls, in a high wind, hearing planes above,—I note: to remember: the circular walk at the Tower with the hollyhocks; & the little 1870 girl in white with bands of black looking out of the window in its deep wall, as Eth Bowen & I sat talking. We walked from 37 through Temple, along river, up Thames Street, to the Tower, talking talking about what? her going to Ireland on a Govt mission; leaving Clarence Terrace; writing, it was my ‘greatness’ as we circled the town. No, I dont think it was only flattery I wanted. Something warmer. On top of bus, we talked again—a good idea; talking in many changing scenes: it changes topics & moods, battling among the Billingsgate porters with their shelly fishy hats; then stopping: crossing: running up bus steps.

I forgot to record my idiotic anguish, the night the Hutches—J., M. & Jeremy dined, about my dress. How queer that wave of agony: about 2 in the morning: so overpowering & irrational. Next day I found Jeanne in Judd Street to alter it & recovered serenity, & even had, once more, the bright inspiration that Jeanne of Judd Street—a small brown moth of a woman—who succeeded the old improper Frenchwoman—shall make all my clothes in future, beautifully, & for nothing."
1940.07.12,"How odd that I should have had 3 letters in praise of Trimmer—Lady Oxford, Pipsey & a Helen Browne—when I was going to tear the proof up! How silly I was to be enraged yesterday (1) by Miss Gardner (2) by being beaten at bowls. Yet how the grass shone pale emerald green when I walked off my temper on the marsh after dinner. The passages of colour, over Asheham, like the green backgrounds in Vermeer & then the little rusty grey church, & the cows, sun beaded, fringed with sun. We quarrelled about our communal feeling: I said I simper when I cohort with Gardner. L. said … but we made it up.

We were shown how charcoal absorbs gas in the Hall. And then, after a dull necessary lecture, old Miss Green, shedding her officers cloak, appeared in blue trousers & let herself down from the Rectory window, hanging by her toenails & descending with a jump. Captain Hanna said his bones were like glass. If he jumped, even from a bus, they would break. A red lipped woman asked me if Aga saucepans were made of aluminium; & L. has given all our saucepans to Mrs Ebbs to make aeroplanes with. I dont like any of the feelings war breeds: patriotism; communal &c, all sentimental & emotional parodies of our real feelings. But then, we’re in for it. Every day we have our raids: at night the bloodhounds are out. I open my window when I hear the Germans, & the broad stalks of light rise all over the meadow feeling for them—a strange early morning spectacle. One sees nothing but the feelers of light. Then the drone buzz booms away, rather like a dentists drill. No invasion so far.

I refused Dotty & Hilda, rather tartly; for Hilda’s hand on the reins is a heavy one—why not write the same article, she suggests, twice in different words? Why not indeed. The idea of their book is one of those meritorious meretricious tidy-minded ideas, that are the most detestable & the least pinned downable. Money patriotism, literature & some organising [?] arranging [?] motive, all embracing & intertwining."
1940.07.20,"Things to write about when I’m less sleepy (back an hour ago from London). 1. Ray’s death; 2. Talk with Rose Macaulay; 3. Book to come out on 25th; 4. Madame Spira; 5. Lady Oxford: 6. Bella & Tom. I daresay theres a 7th & an 8th. But these headings will remind me, when I’ve walked & slept off the extreme jadedness of London. 7 might be Jack & Jeremy Hutch to stay the night. 8 the photographs of the womans body in the abortionists cupboard: her dead face: long hair: legs trussed up. 9. Must be Hitler’s speech yesterday: lets talk common sense & end the war—if not: & instead of any more headings I shall now cool & expand on the marsh. Oh 10 might be my new resolve of tidiness. Desk & table both clear."
1940.07.24,"Yes those are things to write about; but I want at the moment, the eve of publication moment, to discover my emotions. They are fitful: thus not very strong—nothing like so strong as before The Years—oh dear nothing like. Still they twinge. I wish it were this time next week. There’ll be Morgan, & Desmond. And I fear Morgan will say—just enough to show he doesn’t like, but is kind. D. will certainly depress. The Times Lit Sup (after its ill temper about Reviewing) will find chinks. T. & T. will be enthusiastic. And—thats all. I repeat that 2 strains, as usual will develop: fascinating; dull; life like; dead. So why do I twinge? knowing it almost by heart. But not quite. Mrs Leh⁠[man]⁠n enthusiastic: John silent. I shall of course be sneered at by those who sniff at Bloomsbury. I’d forgotten that. But as L. is combing Sally I cant concentrate. No room of my own. For 11 days I’ve been contracting in the glare of different faces. It ended yesterday with the W.I.: my talk—it was talked;—about the Dreadnought. A simple, on the whole natural, friendly occasion. Cups of tea; biscuits; & Mrs Chavasse, in a tight dress, presiding: out of respect for me, it was a Book tea. Miss Gardner had 3 Gs. pinned to her frock; Mrs Thompsett 3 weeks: & someone else a silver spoon.

No I cant go on to Ray’s death, about which I know nothing, save that that very large woman, with the shock of grey hair, & the bruised lip; that monster, whom I remember typical of young womanhood, has suddenly gone. She had a kind of representative quality, in her white coat & trousers; wall building, disappointed, courageous, without what? imagination?

Lady Oxford said that there was no virtue in saving; more in spending. She hung over my neck in a spasm of tears. Mrs Campbell [unidentified] has cancer. But in a twinkling she recovered & began to spend. A cold chicken she said was always under cover on the sideboard at my service. The country people send butter. She was beautifully dressed in a rayed silk, with a dark blue tie; a dark blue fluted Russian cap with a red flap. This was given her by her milliner: the fruit of spending.

All the walls, the protecting & reflecting walls, wear so terribly thin in this war. There’s no standard to write for: no public to echo back: even the ‘tradition’ has become transparent. Hence a a repetition I see certain energy & recklessness—part good—part bad I daresay. But its the only line to take. And perhaps the walls, if violently beaten against, will finally contain me.

I feel tonight still veiled. The veil will be lifted tomorrow, when my book comes out. Thats what may be painful: may be cordial. And then I may feel once more round me the wall I’ve missed—or vacancy? or chill?

I make these notes, but am tired of notes—tire of Gide, tired of de Vigny notebooks. I want something sequacious now & robust. In the first days of the war I cd read notes only.

Ray’s hair stood up very vigorously on either side of the parting which lately she had made in the middle. Her bitterness at Oliver, whom she had loved, & did love, was perceptible—something tart about her; & as if some of the petals of what she hoped, as a girl, to be so yellow a sunflower—she was ambitious, self confident, was greedy & a little insensitive about ‘fame’—as if these petals had withered & she cd. no longer be confident; was indeed disappointed, a little wounded, embittered; chiefly shown by her immense activity, as if always trying to get what she could not. And she grew so unwieldy; & cared so little for appearances; yet was envious, I guess, of the graces; & hadnt achieved altogether what her intention in disregarding the graces had been. I mean, she planned a great unconventional rough hewn figure; & it didnt altogether come off. She played patience endlessly. She had educated her children so carefully. Yet look what failures they both are. Christopher unimaginative; Barbara—oh, well she ran off the rails completely: B. was bitter against intellect—which Ray reverenced: yet had no aesthetic sense. What else? Her humanity: offered to help when I was ill. Her competence. Her good nature. Her wisdom—yes, as she grew older, it was there. Perhaps at 70 she wd have created the legend of—the wise matriarch: have been surrounded, & central. But she died while it was in the rough, aged 53. Also a kind of rough radiance. Corpulent. Yet keen. Bright eyed. But I never knew her domestically. Always something of the office—documents, overalls, interviews—about her. One of the people who was ‘in love’ in the old way. Oliver’s letter asking her to see over some factory made her flush, at Firle in my little dining room. She tore it to scraps I think. So I’ve written higgledypiggledy, about Ray. Her cordiality—& queer little quick voice: smoking: it used to be a pipe. Initiative⁠[?], but no charm. Wrote without stopping. No form, no fineness. Her life much of a scramble & a fight: but in the office I guess very commanding, controlling & masterly."
1940.07.25,"I’m not very nervous at the moment: indeed at worst its only a skin deep nervousness; for after all, the main people approve; still I shall be relieved if Morgan approves. That I suppose I shall know tomorrow. The first review (Lynd.) says: “deep imaginative sympathy…. makes him an attractive figure (in spite of wild phrases): There is little drama….. at the same time those interested in modern art will find it of absorbing interest…” Then he goes on to mis-quote, having I daresay his whiskey by him.

I shall settle in very happily I think to Coleridge after the splash is over. I expect some letters. But what is true, is that then I can write entirely to please myself: first a C.R: then PH: leaving spaces for odds & ends: for ex: an article for the pressing American lady. I’m thick in Mme Spira’s affairs: she sobbed & left her strangled wool gloves behind her. I’ve heard from Margot & M. Storm Jameson—oh the bore of being kind! This war inflicts boredom endlessly. My little triumph today was that Flint [Lewes grocer] gave me extra tea. Now margarine is rationed; & I have a horrid skinflint morning ordering dinner, suspecting Louie who of course helps herself to this & that.

What a curious relation is mine with Roger at this moment—I who have given him a kind of shape after his death—Was he like that? I feel very much in his presence at the moment: as if I were intimately connected with him; as if we together had given birth to this vision of him: a child born of us. Yet he had no power to alter it. And yet for some years it will represent him."
1940.07.26,"I think I have taken, say a good second, judging from the Lit Sup review. No Morgan. Times say it takes a very high place indeed among biogs: Times say I have a genius for the relevant: Times (art critic I gather) goes on to analyse R.’s tones &c. Times intelligent, but not room for more.

Its a nice quiet feeling now. With my Coleridge beneath me, & this over, as it really very nearly (how I hate that clash) is, I’m aware of something permanent & real in my existence. By the way, I’m rather proud of having done a solid work. I am content, somehow. But when I read my post its like putting my hand in a jar of leeches: Spira asking this; Douie soliciting books; John my L⁠[eaning] T⁠[ower] article; & so I’ve a mint of dull dreary letters to write. But its an incredibly lovely—yes lovely is the word—transient, changing, warm, capricious summer evening. Also I won two games.

A large hedgehog was found drowned in the lily pool; L. tried to resuscitate it. An amusing sight. 2/6 is offered by the Govt. for live hedgehogs. I’m reading Ruth Benedict with pressure of suggestions—about Culture patterns—which suggests rather too much. Six vols of Aug. Hare also suggest—little articles.

But I’m very peaceful, momentarily, this evening.

Saturday I suppose a no-review day. Immune is again the right word. No, John hasn’t read it. When the 12 planes went over, out to sea, to fight, last evening, I had I think an individual, not communal BBC dictated feeling. I almost instinctively wished them luck. I should like to be able to take scientific notes of reactions. Invasion may be tonight or not at all—thats Joubert’s summing up. And—I had something else to say? but what. And dinner to get ready."
1940.07.28,"Oh yes I see what this book is—its a refuge from Desmond. The mild kind avuncular Desmond. I’ve been beaten at bowls, & so the half paragraph turns to lead. Now if Morgan had written I shouldnt have turned it to lead. But I feel my irritation at being beaten fasten itself & phrase make—make the old phrases, for wh. God knows, there’s no justification whatever today. Why do I mind being beaten at bowls? I think I connect it with Hitler. Yet I played very well. And, in an hours time, shall be repeating the other phrase wh. I made during the first game: a Season of calm weather. Such a curious peace; a satisfactory quiet. I shall see no one in London Yes for a moment I believe that I can compass a season of calm weather. Yet ‘they’ say the invasion is fixed for Aug. 16th. A season of calm weather is the crown for which I’m always pushing & shoving, swimming like the hedgehog who cuts his throat with his paws Nessa said yesterday at C⁠[harlesto]⁠n, if he swims. Angelica there: I diagnose strain; a little defiance, restlessness. And feel in Q. something heavy, mature, depressed. Almost a year he’s been in the fields: all corn coloured & red poppied with his blue eyes for convolvulus. Judith & L. came on Monday.. Thus our island will be invaded—my season of calm weather. Many an island a green isle—why cant I remember poetry? Clive silly & truculent about Auden & Isherwood. I guess he’d already looked up his own name in R⁠[oger]. Said he’d only read Margery⁠[’s Foreword]. And my family will accept this book in complete silence. 2 years hard work. But I shall hear eno’ from ‘the public’. Why dont we praise, or blame, each other? Has everything been said? Is it the repletion at the end of a party?

Queer, when its so tame after all, a book coming out, why one writes them? How much part does ‘coming out’ play in the pleasure of writing then? Each one accumulates a little of the fictitious V.W. whom I carry like a mask about the world.

[Later.] Waiting for the Sunday papers in which RF. will, or may, be disposed of by Desmond &, perhaps, Basil de Selincourt—looking up over the page to see if L. is coming across the orchard—does not favour the looking up of quotations in Coleridge’s letters. I know that I shant get any superlatives either way. I know that Desmond (who very likely won’t do it) will if he does, gently hum & haw something about Mrs Woolf’s charm & sympathy & then proceed to give his own version of R. which will probably be more amusing than mine; & that’ll fill his short column. Of course I am anxious partly to know how it strikes R.’s friends: thats an element not present in a novel review. Anyhow, how much less exacerbating this Sunday morning is than The Years Sunday morning. I remember coming out here in an ecstasy almost a bewilderment of relief when B. de S. for whose opinion I have hardly any respect, praised it—I thought too highly. No, L. does not come.

Its a splendid summer morning, & Janet’s white butterflies—the white birds she saw when she was dying—are all about the trees. It is 10.30 & I think I am calm eno’ to return to Coleridge, until 11. when I shall allow myself to go indoors. I forgot, in the above analysis, to include the Frys—their reactions to good or bad reviews. That also tells.

[Later.] Yes, Desmond is, as always to me, slightly depressing. I divine that is that he feels I haven’t given the familiar, the human, Roger—‘our’ Roger. That I’ve made a just & animated biography, stressing the public side, the intellect, the austerity & so on; but not been personal & ungirt enough. I think this is what L. felt. But then Nessa & Margery didn’t. Anyhow there it is—& Desmond is going to write at greater length next week. Nothing in the Observer. So I return, not much depressed, not much exalted, to my Coleridge."
1940.08.01,"I was going to say, when Judith interrupted, the book is a dud to my friends: but seems selling well. This comment is made on coming back from London this lovely night: & a very good dinner, a Burma Cigar & am not a jot depressed. Indeed—he that is down need fear no fall &c.—a dud, I’ll explain later why I say this."
1940.08.02,"Complete silence surrounds that book. It might have sailed into the blue & been lost. “One of our books did not return” as the BBC puts it. No review by Morgan, no review at all. No letter. And tho’ I suspect Morgan has refused, finding it unpalatable, still I remain—yes honestly, quiet minded, & prepared to face a complete, a lasting silence. And full—no not of ideas—I’m so jaded after Philip Morell, Pippa, & the London uproar—but with a sense of things forming, & freedom. So thats satisfactory.

About Philip—laid in a lemon coloured jersey in bed. Ott’s drawing room cut in half. P. rather shaky, rather patched in complexion, & plausible, fluent & undistinguished. Reminisced: about Roger: a most ineffective man; a most unhappy man; his life so sordid. “No, I’ve not had a happy life. I wasted my time in politics. No we were very unhappy Ottoline & I at Garsington. Quarrelled often. Thought of separating. We were so unhappy we came here. Our last years were very happy.” This said with his old rams watery smile. Cheerful enough, but only with Bridge & old memories. I think disillusioned about Ott. Tepid about her diaries. Thinks he’s getting weaker & wont live through the winter. Things suddenly go black. Surrounded by polished furniture: too much furniture. Very flabby yet mildly affectionate. Showed me photographs: if I’ve the energy I’ll get one copied for you. Then summoned Milly had out shawls pressed one—a coloured one I chose—on me. Outside Milly asked me to look at his bathroom, said “He’s very lonely very lonely. He’s too proud to ask people to come. None of the old friends come; only the family. Miss Julian does her best. But she’s always been hard—she doesnt care for any of her ladyships things. She’s no comfort. The Dr says dont be shocked if you go in & find him dead. I’m glad you encouraged him to play Bridge. I say after all whats the use of living without …… but he’s better now. I put him straight to bed when he comes back. There is his place—in the dining room with a book rest in front of his plate.”

I shook hands & walked off with my shawl."
1940.08.04,"Just time, while Judith & Leslie finish their game, to record oh a great relief—Desmond’s review really says all I wanted said. The book delights friends & the younger generation say Yes, yes we know him; & its not only delightful but important. Thats enough. And it gave me a very calm rewarded feeling—not the old triumph, as over a novel; but the feeling I’ve done what was asked of me, given my friends what they wanted. Just as I’d decided I’d given them nothing but the materials for a book I hadnt written. Now I can be content: needn’t worry what people think: for Desmond is a good bell ringer; & will start the others—I mean, the talk among intimates will follow, more or less, his lines. Herbert Read & MacColl have bit their hardest; put their case; now only Morgan remains, & perhaps a poisoned dart from W. Lewis. I thought I’d mentioned Read: polite to me; very mean & spiteful about R."
1940.08.06,"Yes I was very happy again when I saw Clive’s blue envelope at breakfast (with John) this morning. Its Clive almost—what?—devout—no quiet, serious, completely without sneer approving. As good in its way as the best of my books—the best biography for many years—The first part as good as the last & no break. So I’m confirmed in what I felt, even when I had that beak pecking walk in March with a temperature of 101 with Leonard—confirmed in what I feel—that the first part is really more generally interesting, though less complex & intensified than the last. I’m sure it was necessary—as a solid pavement for the whole to stand on. So I’m really & truly immune, & feel, if only Louie’s father hadnt died, & Mabel’s lover hadnt gone to hospital so that I’ve all the cooking & washing up to do today, that I could go on to the next thing—to many next things. Is it an illusion that I’m freer & stronger, as a writer, than ever? Only now John persistently presses for my LT article; & the American lady—one never is free for more than a dogs chain length.

Men excavating gun emplacements in the bank. They look like little swarms of busy ants, as I walk. Cementing floors; sand bagging walls. Great lorries of material go bursting down the Roman Road. No one pays any attention—so blasé are we. Guns along the river, boughs for camouflage, excite no one. Its like the raising of the gallows tree, for an execution now expected in a week or fortnight. R. sells well. Talk of reprint."
1940.08.10,"And then Morgan slightly damped me: but I was damp already from Leslie hum haw the night before & the day before & again tomorrow. So Morgan & Vita slightly damped: & Bob slightly elated & Ethel, & some old boy in the Spectator, attacking Read. But Gods truth, thats the end of it all. No more reviews, & if I had solitude—no men driving stakes digging fresh gun emplacements & no neighbours, doubtless I cd. expand & soar—into PH. into Coleridge; but must first—damn John—re-write the LT.

Incessant company is as bad as solitary confinement—Angelica for 2 nights, adorable, oh yes, & intimate & mature, & I see so much more of her side when I talk to her—her so reasonable & lovely side—if it werent too, a delusion. But is love ever quite a delusion? Well J.’s is. I reduce myself to initials for discretion; but cant spin a word to catch a fly after these 10 days of people & people again. Now Mabel’s here wh. adds to comfort but diminishes privacy. So thats my chart at the moment. No invasion. Large air flights—little white gnats this evening. Sales very good—2nd edition ordered. But I want sleep & silence."
1940.08.16,"Third edition ordered. L. said, at 37 on Wednesday “Its booming.” The boom is dulled by our distance. And why does a word of tepidity depress more than a word of praise exalts? I dont know. I refer to Waley: I dont refer to Pamela—great work of art &c. Well, Its taking its way. Its selling. Its done. And I’m writing PH. wh. leaves a spare hour. Many air raids. One as I walked. A haystack was handy. But walked on, & so home. All clear. Then sirens again. Then Judith & Leslie. Bowls. Then Mrs Ebbs &c to borrow table. All clear. I must make a stop gap for the last hour, or I shall dwindle, as I’m doing here. But PH. is a concentration—a screw. So I will go in, & read Hare & write to Ethel.

Very hot. Even out here.

[Later.] They came very close. We lay down under the tree. The sound was like someone sawing in the air just above us. We lay flat on our faces, hands behind head. Dont close yr teeth said L. They seemed to be sawing at something stationary. Bombs shook the windows of my lodge. Will it drop I asked? If so, we shall be broken together. I thought, I think, of nothingness—flatness, my mood being flat. Some fear I suppose. Shd we take Mabel to garage. Too risky to cross the garden L. said. Then another came from Newhaven. Hum & saw & buzz all round us. A horse neighed on the marsh. Very sultry. Is it thunder? I said. No guns, said L. from Ringmer, from Charleston way. Then slowly the sound lessened. Mabel in kitchen said the windows shook. Air raid still on, distant planes. Leslie playing bowls. I well beaten.

My books only gave me pain, Ch. Brontë said. Today I agree. Very heavy dull & damp. This must at once be cured. The all clear. 5 to 7. 144 down last night."
1940.08.19,"Yesterday, 18th, Sunday, there was a roar. Right on top of us they came. I looked at the plane, like a minnow at a roaring shark. Over they flashed—3, I think. Olive green. Then pop pop pop—German? Again pop pop pop, over Kingston. Said to be 5 Bombers hedge hopping on their way to London. The closest shave so far. 144 brought down—no that was last time. And no raid (so far) today. Rehearsal. I cannot read Remorse. Why not say so?"
1940.08.23,"Book flopped. Sales down to 15 a day since air raid on London. Is that the reason? Will it pick up? But I’m ravaged by Ann in house, Judith Leslie Eleanor Camilla in & out of house. Ann goes tomorrow. L. says he has a moral feeling of duty to young."
1940.08.28,"How I should like to write poetry all day long—thats the gift to me of poor Ann, who never reads poetry because she hated it at school. She stayed from Tuesday to Sunday night, to be exact; & almost had me down. Why? Because (partly) she has the artists temperament without being an artist. She’s temperamental, but has no outlet. I find her charming; individual; honest, & somehow pathetic. Her curious obtusity, her slatiness of mind, is perceptible to her. And she hesitates. Ought one to make up? Richard says yes—I say no. The truth is she has no instinct for colour; no more than for music or pictures. A great deal of force & spirit & yet always at the leap something balks her. I can imagine her crying herself to sleep. So, having brought no rations, or book, she floundered on here. I called her, to mitigate her burden, My good dog, my Afghan hound—with her long too thick legs, & her long body; & the shock of wild unbrushed hair on top. I’m glad I’m so nice looking she said. And she is. But well it taught me, that week of unintermittent interruptions, bowls, tea parties & droppings in, what public school is like—no privacy. A good rub with a coarse towel for my old mind no doubt. And Judith & Leslie are about to play bowls. This is why, my first solitary morning, after London, & the protracted air raid—from 9.30 to 4am—I was so light so free so happy I wrote what I call PH poetry. Is it good? I suppose not, very.

I should say, to placate V.W. when she wishes to know what was happening in Aug. 1940—that the air raids are now at their prelude. Invasion, if it comes, must come within 3 weeks. The harrying of the public is now in full swing. The air saws; the wasps drone; the siren—its now Weeping Willie in the papers—is as punctual as the vespers. We’ve not had our raid yet, we say. Two in London. One caught me in the L. Library. There I sat reading in Scrutiny that Mrs W. after all was better than the young. At this I was pleased. John Buchan—“V.W is our best critic since M. Arnold & wiser & juster—” also pleased me. I must write to Pamela. Sales a little better.

28th Aug. P.S. to the last page. We went out on to the terrace, began playing. A large two decker plane came heavily & slowly—L. said a Wellesley something. A training plane said Leslie. Suddenly there was pop pop from behind the Church. Practising we said. The plane circled slowly out over the marsh & back, very close to the ground & to us. Then a whole volley of pops (like bags burst) came together. The plane swung off, slow & heavy & circling towards Lewes. We looked. Leslie saw the German black cross. All the workmen were looking. Its a German; that dawned. It was the enemy. It dipped among the fir trees over Lewes & did not rise. Then we heard the drone. Looked up & saw 2 planes very high. They made for us. We started to shelter in the Lodge. But they wheeled & Leslie saw the English sign. So we watched—they side slipped glided swooped & roared for about 5 minutes round the fallen plane as if identifying & making sure—then made off towards London. Our version is that it was a wounded plane, looking for a landing. “It was a Jerry sure eno’” the men said: the men who are making a gun hiding by the gate. It wd have been a peaceful matter of fact death to be popped off on the terrace playing bowls this very fine cool sunny August evening."
1940.08.31,"Now we are in the war. England is being attacked. I got this feeling for the first time completely yesterday. The feeling of pressure, danger horror. Vita rang up at 6 to say she cdn’t come. She was sitting at S⁠[issinghurs]⁠t. the bombs were falling round the house. Theyd been fighting all day. I’m too jaded to give the feeling—of talking to someone who might be killed any moment. Can you hear that? she said. No, I cdnt. Thats another. That’s another. She repeated the same thing—about staying in order to drive the ambulance—time after time, like a person who cant think. She’d heard that Christopher Hobhouse was killed by a bomb: that Cynthia North—so lovely like a young colt she was killed by a bomb she trod on. It was very difficult talking. She said it was a comfort to talk. She broke off—Oh how I do mind this, & put the telephone down. I went & played bowls. A perfect quiet hot evening. Later the planes began zooming. Explosions. We were talking to Leslie & Judith & Pat Trench [unidentified.]. To bed. Planes very close: explosions. Nessa says today there was a great blaze at Ripe. A tinkling sound in the field. Bomb cases found today. A great raid on London last night. Today quiet here. When I rang up St. after dinner, someone cut in with a call to Maldon. “Restricted service. Things very bad there just now.” The feeling is that a battle is going on—a fierce battle. May last 4 weeks. Am I afraid? Intermittently. The worst of it ones mind wont work with a spring next morning. Of course this may be the beginning of invasion. A sense of pressure. Endless local stories. No—its no good trying to capture the feeling of England being in a battle. L. has just driven Judith & Leslie to the station. At last we shall be alone. Molly wont come. I daresay if I write fiction & Col⁠[eridge] & not that infernal bomb article for USA, I shall swim into quiet water. L. sleeps sound all through it every night."
1940.09.02,"There might be no war, the past 2 days. Only one raid warning. Perfectly quiet nights. A lull after the attacks on London. At Charleston yesterday a skeleton Memoir Club. We sat in the sun. It was hot. The apples hung red. Not a sound. Angelica & B. produced a sense of strain. Maynard what I call unredeemed Maynard, rather severe, snubbing, truculent. Talk about lives. Mine of Roger I gather is called by Maynard “The official life”. ‘Why not write the real life for the Memoir Club?’ (thats why I thought him morose & savage.) Bunny said Biographies will always interest. Morgan said not to the next generation. The sensitive like ourselves wont interest them. I said autobiographies are their line. M. interested came over to me. We discussed Hugh. I said he was a prostitute. Q. said Derain was a prostitute. I read my Dreadnought notes, not very well. Lydia wdn’t come. “She feels this is not the time for brains” said Maynard. Tired after bowls & writing my USA War article my mind jibs at recording. Yet talk is interesting. Nessa said artists always did what they could. Maynard said there’d be no change after the war. We shd. go back to where we were. Morgan lost his spectacles—found them in a book. Clive had been on Firle Tower & saw the flash at sea when the explosion came. Said it was a German big gun firing across Channel. Q. denied this. Bunny A. & Maynard walked off. I told Morgan how I’d tried being honest with Hugh. Hugh had snubbed Morgan. Talk about Penguins. Argument as to whether they’re read.

So lovely an evening that the flat & the downs looked as if seen for the last time. No raid. Slept over Sara Coleridge. Letters from Ben (R. absorbing) from Bessie T. (a great biography). Letters I shd be answering instead of scribbling here. It is perfect summer weather. A man stopped on the bank with all its battlements to say so. Mr Freeth showed me the fire engine: danger of incendiary bombs. Will Jansen paint the iron shed? He’s a matter of fact chap. I urged camouflage if only on artistic grounds. And so this page is perhaps unnecessarily filled"
1940.09.05,"Hot, hot, hot. Record heat wave, record summer if we kept records this summer. At 2.30 a plane zooms; 10 minutes later air raid sounds; 20 later, all clear. Hot, I repeat; & doubt if I’m a poet. HP [sic] hard labour. Brain w—no, I cant think of the word—yes, wilts. An idea. All writers are unhappy. The picture of the wor⁠[l]⁠d in books is thus too dark. The wordless are the happy: women in cottage gardens: Mrs Chavasse. Not a true picture of the wor⁠[l]⁠d; only a writers picture. Are musicians, painters happy? Is their world happier.

Now, in my nightgown, to walk on the marshes."
1940.09.07,"An air raid in progress. Planes zooming. No, that one’s gone over, very quick & loud. Cdnt see if it were English.

Ben Nicolson for the night. A very tall red faced obstinate tongue tied apprehensive gentle but obdurate not very clever, slow indeed, serious however; reminding us of Vita (to look at) then Harold, then a touch queerly incongruously of Eddy. Very well mannered wh. perhaps increases difficulty. Very diffident. Coming from a large world. But speechless: till after dinner: when he developed his charge against Roger: that he didn’t personify artists, & by omitting biography, intellectualised: so didnt reach the masses, “didnt show that Leonardo was thinking of a tree.” I guess B.’s got hold of a crooked stick; & will produce (come peace) rather formless, many worded, literary books. Dressed as a private in big boots this morning.

More planes over the house, going I suppose to London, which is raided every night. A fight no doubt in Kent."
1940.09.10,"Back from half a day in London—perhaps our strangest visit. When we got to Gower St. a barrier with Diversion on it. No sign of damage. But, coming to Doughty St. a crowd. Then Miss Perkins at the window. Meek S. roped off. Wardens there, not allowed in. The house about 30 yards from ours struck at one this morning by a bomb. Completely ruined. Another bomb in the square still unexploded. We walked round the back. Stood by Jane Harrison’s house. The house was still smouldering. That is a great pile of bricks. Underneath all the people who had gone down to their shelter. Scraps of cloth hanging to the bare walls at the side still standing. A looking glass I think swinging. Like a tooth knocked out—a clean cut. Our house undamaged. No windows yet broken—perhaps the bomb has now broken them. We saw Sage Bernal with an arm band jumping on top of the bricks—who lived there? I suppose the casual young men & women I used to see, from my window; the flat dwellers who used to have flower pots & sit on the balcony. All now blown to bits—The garage man at the back—blear eyed & jerky told us he had been blown out of his bed by the explosion; made to take shelter in a church—a hard cold seat, he said, & a small boy lying in my arms. “I cheered when the all clear sounded. I’m aching all over.” He said the Jerrys had been over for 3 nights trying to bomb Kings X. They had destroyed half Argyll Street, also shops in Grays Inn Road. Then Mr Pritchard ambled up. Took the news as calm as a grig. “They actually have the impertinence to say this will make us accept peace—!” he said: he watches raids from his flat roof & sleeps like a hog. So, after talking to Miss Perkins & Mrs Jackson (a bloodless sand hopper), but both serene—Miss P. had slept on a camp bed in her shelter—we went on to Grays Inn. Left the car & saw Holborn. A vast gap at the top of Chancery Lane. Smoking still. Some great shop entirely destroyed: the hotel opposite like a shell. In a wine shop there were no windows left. People standing at the tables—I think drink being served. Heaps of blue green glass in the road at Chancery Lane. Men breaking off fragments left in the frames. Glass falling. Then into Lincolns Inn. To the N.S. office: windows broken, but house untouched. We went over it. Deserted. Wet passages. Glass on stairs. Doors locked. So back to the car. A great block of traffic. The Cinema behind Mme Tussaud’s torn open: the stage visible; some decoration swinging. All the R⁠[egent’s]. Park houses with broken windows, but undamaged. And then miles & miles of orderly ordinary streets—all Bayswater, & Sussex Sqre as usual. Streets empty. Faces set & eyes bleared. In Chancery Lane I saw a man with a barrow of music books. My typists office destroyed. Then at Wimbledon a Siren—people began running. We drove, through almost empty streets, as fast as possible. Horses taken out of the shafts. Cars pulled up. Then the all clear. The people I think of now are the very grimy lodging house keepers, say in Heathcote Street; with another night to face: old wretched women standing at their doors; dirty, miserable. Well—as Nessa said on the phone, its coming very near. I had thought myself a coward for suggesting that we shd. not sleep 2 nights at 37. I was greatly relieved when Miss P. telephoned advising us not to stay, & L. agreed."
1940.09.11,"Churchill has just spoken. A clear, measured, robust speech. Says the invasion is being prepared. Its for the next 2 weeks apparently if at all. Ships & barges massing at French ports. The bombing of London of course preparatory to invasion. Our majestic city—&c. which touches me, for I feel London majestic. Our courage &c. Another raid last night on London. Time bomb struck the Palace. John rang up. He was in Meck. Sqre the night of the raid. Wants the press moved at once. L. is to go up on Friday. Our windows are broken John says. He is lodging out somewhere. Meck. Sqre evacuated. A plane shot down before our eyes just before tea: over the [Lewes] race course; a scuffle; a swerve: then a plunge; & a burst of thick black smoke. Percy says the pilot baled out. We count now on an air raid about 8.30. Anyhow, whether or not, we hear the sinister sawing noise about then, which loudens & fades; then a pause; then another comes. “Theyre at it again” we say as we sit, I doing my work, L. making cigarettes. Now & then theres a thud. The windows shake. So we know London is raided again.

I decided today after tears from Mable (about L. & the electricity—the latest of many grievances) that she must go. She said—oh the usual things—about not giving him satisfaction; too nervous to speak to him. The poor tallow fleshed almost petrified woman; who can smile tho’, & is unselfish (to me) but its no good."
1940.09.12,"A gale has risen. Weather broken. Armada weather. No sound of planes today only wind. Terrific air traffic last night. But the raid beaten off by new London barrage. This is cheering. If we can hold out this week—next week—week after—if the weather’s turned—if the force of the raids on London is broken—

We go up tomorrow to see John about moving Press; to patch the windows, rescue valuables, & get letters—if that is we’re allowed in the square. Oh, blackberrying I conceived, or remoulded, an idea for a Common History book—to read from one end of lit. including biog; & range at will, consecutively."
1940.09.13,"A strong feeling of invasion in the air. Roads crowded with army wagons: soldiers. Just back from half day in London. Raid, unheard by us, started outside Wimbledon. A sudden stagnation. People vanished. Yet some cars went on. We decided to visit lavatory on the hill; shut. So L. made use of tree. Pouring. Guns in the distance. Saw a pink brick shelter. That was the only interest of our journey—our talk with the man woman & child who were living there. They had been bombed at Clapham. Their house unsafe. So they hiked to Wimbledon. Preferred this unfinished gun emplacement to a refugee over crowded house. They had a roadmans lamp; a saucepan & cd boil tea. The nightwatchman wdn’t accept their tea; had his own. Someone gave them a bath. In one of He laid rather a thin rug on the step for me to sit on. An officer looked in. “Making ready for the invasion” said the man, as if it were going off in about ten minutes. the Wimbledon houses there was only a caretaker. Of course they cdn’t house us. But she was very nice—gave them a sit down. We all talked. Middle class smartish lady on her way to Epsom regretted she cdnt house the child. But we wdn’t part with her, they said—the man a voluble emotional Kelt, the woman placid Saxon. As long as she’s all right we dont mind. They sleep on some shavings. Bombs had dropped on the Common. He a house painter. Very friendly & hospitable. They liked having people in to talk. What will they do? The man thought Hitler wd soon be over. The lady in the cocks hat said Never. Twice we left. More guns. Came back. At last started, keeping an eye on shelters & peoples behaviour. Reached Russell Hotel. No John. Loud gunfire. We sheltered. Started for Meck. Sqre: met John, who said the Sqre still closed; so lunched in the hotel. Decided the Press emergency—to employ Garden City Press—in 20 minutes. Raid still on. Walked to Meck. Sqre. Refused admittance. John told us the story of Monday night. Bombs whistle, if they fall near. He heard two whistles. Looked out. A great blaze in Guilford St. Gas main struck & the Foundling shelter opposite Stephen hit. He decided he’d take shelter. Then an explosion. He went into Square & saw a tree where Byron Court had been. Also a great cloud of thick grey dust. Also a man walking slowly in his pyjamas. Then they were told to leave the Square. Later he met several young women at some Bar with hair, he thought, powdered—really the dust of the house. Some saved by an iron bar in the basement. Some its thought killed. They became merry. He rather white & shaky. Left him with distant guns firing—Started back. All clear in Maryleb⁠[one] High St."
1940.09.14,"A sense of invasion—that is lorries of soldiers & machines—like cranes—walloping along to Newhaven. An air raid is on. A little pop rattle wh. I take to be machine guns, just gone off. Planes soaring & roaring. Percy & L. say some are English. Mabel comes out & looks. Asks if we want fish fried or boiled. As the result of a friendly cool talk, she’s going to ask Flossie [her sister] about plans. They may set up outside the raid area. Anyhow, its settled, I think that she leaves here. A great relief. I like being alone in our little boat. I like provisioning & seeing alls shipshape & not having dependants. And must now write to Harry Stephen before bowls—a warm letter, couched in Stephenese, about Roger. Distant pops—a rapid little patter of sound over Newhaven way. Workmen on the hanger haystack—disguising a gun—said “Wish I were as sure of a thousand pounds as of winning the war.” Complete confidence. Buck Palace bombed. Altar exposed; & in Eastbourne yesterday a church ruined & organ thrown on road. The BBC become rather sanctimonious over this.

The great advantage of this page is that it gives me a fidget ground. Fidgets: caused by losing at bowls & invasion; caused by another howling banshee, by having no book I must read; & so on. I am reading Sevigné: how recuperative last week; gone stale a little with that mannered & sterile Bussy now. Even through the centuries his acid dandified somehow supercilious well what?—cant find the word—this manner of his, this character penetrates; & moreover reminds me of someone I dislike. Is it Logan? Theres a ceremony in him that reminds me of Tom. I suggest supercilious Theres a parched artificial cruelty &—oh the word! the word!— Am I oversensitive to character, in writing? I think we moderns lack love. Our torture makes us writhe. But I cant go into that—a phrase that brings in old Rose [Macaulay], to whom I mean to write. One always thinks theres a landing place coming. But there aint. A stage, a branch, an end. I dislike writing letters of thanks about Roger. I’ve said it so many times. I think I will begin my new book by reading Ifor Evans, 6d Penguin. And whatever happens I will settle & sun on the moment. 58—not so many more. This is quite possible, in any condition. I sometimes think about violent death. Who’s whistling in the churchyard? The Major says there was a landing, repulsed, at Bournemouth⁠[?]. Keep out the war from this page, now & then. I’m reading Henry Williamson. Again I dislike him."
1940.09.15,"No invasion yet. Rumours that it was attempted, but barges sunk with great loss. Via Maynard, via Major Gardner & Percy. Raids over Brighton this afternoon. Hornets (our own) swarmed over my head on the marsh. Sheep frightened. Its difficult to see the English white circle. Mabel goes tomorrow; so pray God the Church bells dont ring tonight. Domestically, a great relief & peace, & expansion, it’ll be tomorrow, into merry kitchen harum scarum ways. Now we go to our last Cook cooked dinner for I dont know how long. Could it be the end of resident servants for ever? This I pray this lovely fitful evening, as well as the usual Damn Hitler prayer. Carried wood; bowls; asked for Sara Coleridge, as tho the New Statesman were immortal."
1940.09.16,"Well, we’re alone in our ship. A very wet stormy day. Mabel stumped off, with her bunions, carrying her bags at 10. Thank you for all your kindness, she said the same to us both. Also wd I give her a reference? “I hope we shall meet again” I said. She said Oh no doubt—thinking I referred to death. So that 5 years uneasy mute but very passive & calm relation is over: a heavy unsunned pear dropped from a twig. And we’re freer, alone. No responsibility: for her. The house solution is to have no residents, but I’m stupid; have been dallying with Mr Williamson’s Confessions, appalled by his ego centricity. Are all writers as magnified in their own eyes? He cant move an inch from the glare of his own personality—his fame. And I’ve never read one of those immortal works.

To Charleston this afternoon, after provisioning for our siege in Lewes. Last night we saw tinsel sparks here & there in the sky over the flat. L. thought they were shells bursting from the London barrage. Great air traffic all night—some loud explosions. I listened for Church Bells, thinking largely I admit, of finding ourselves prisoned here with Mabel. She thought the same. Said that if one is to be killed one will be killed. Prefers death in a Holloway shelter playing cards—naturally—to death here."
1940.09.17,"No invasion. High wind. Yesterday in the Pub. Library I took down a book of Peter Lucas’s criticism. This turned me against writing my book. London Library atmosphere effused. Turned me against all lit crit; these so clever, so airless, so fleshless ingenuities & attempts to prove—that T. S. Eliot, for example is a worse critic than F.L.L. Is all lit. crit. that kind of exhausted air?—book dust, London Library, air. Or is it only that F.L.L. is a second hand, frozen fingered, university specialist, don trying to be creative, don all stuffed with books, writer? Would one say the same of the Common Reader? I dipped for 5 minutes & put the book back depressed. The man asked What do you want Mrs Woolf? I said a history of English literature. But was so sickened, I cdn’t look. There were so many. Nor cd I remember the name of Stopford Brooke.

I continue, after winning two games of bowls. Our island is a desert island. No letters from Meck. No coffee. Papers between 3 & 4. Cant get on to Meck, when we ring up. Some letters take 5 days coming. Trains uncertain. One must get out at Croydon. Angelica goes to Hilton via Oxford. So we, L. & I, are almost cut off. John agitated. Talks of L.’s “bravado”: but L. hasnt spent a night in London. This irritates L. who says he will go up by train tomorrow. Happily he now postpones. I dont want to spend a day bomb dodging; train prisoned. We found a young soldier in the garden last night, coming back. “Can I speak to Mr Woolf?” I thought it meant billeting for certain. No. Could we lend a typewriter? Officer on hill had gone & taken his. So we produced my portable. Then he said: “Pardon Sir. Do you play chess?” He plays chess with passion. So we asked him to tea on Saturday to play. He is with the anti aircraft searchlight on the hill. Finds it dull. Cant get a bath. A straight good natured young man. Professional soldier? I think the son, say of an estate agent, or small shopkeeper. Not public school. Not lower class. But I shall investigate. “Sorry to break into your private life” he said. Also that on Saturday he went to the pictures in Lewes."
1940.09.18,"“We have need of all our courage” are the words that come to the surface this morning; on hearing that all our windows are broken, ceilings down, & most of our china smashed at Meck. Sq. The bomb exploded. Why did we ever leave Tavistock?—whats the good of thinking that? We were about to start for London, when we got on to Miss Perkins who told us. The Press—what remains—is to be moved to Letchworth. A grim morning. How can one settle into Michelet & Coleridge? As I say, we have need of courage. A very bad raid last night on London. Waiting for the wireless. But I did forge ahead with PH all the same."
1940.09.19,"Less need of courage today. I suppose the impression of Miss P.’s voice describing the damage wears off. Another loud night Another bad raid. Oxford Street now smashed. John Lewis, Selfridge, B⁠[ourne] & H⁠[ollingsworth], all my old haunts. Also British Museum forecourt. A gale & rain here. I picked blackberries, & became absorbed in my LP speech—dear—10 minutes talk—but how difficult—for tomorrow. No letters yet from M⁠[ecklenburgh]. S⁠[quare]. No parcels. Pippin [Woolf] wont come. I’m relieved. Percy is up to some swindle about honey. It costs us about 5/- a comb at this rate. He tervisagates in the usual way. Also has stolen wood."
1940.09.21,"We’ve just bottled our honey. I’m in a rage. Nessa has told those d—d Anreps they can come to the [Rodmell] cottage for a fortnight. I walked to Piddinghoe & saw a wedding The clergyman in the vestry said: This page was signed in 1542—almost 400 years ago. 400 years hadnt chiselled those red shy yokels into a very sharp shape. The girl was townish, in pleated purple. The man red & coltish. He was seized by a friend in the porch who stuffed a whole bag of confetti between skin & shirt. “To make up for Brighton!” he said. Then the air raid went. I heard bombs on Brighton.

I have forced myself to overcome my rage at being beaten at Bowls & my fulminations against Nessa by reading Michelet:

As I told Ethel Smyth, one must drop a safety curtain over ones private scene. Michelet is my safety curtain. Posts still held up. No Buszard; no Times book; no answer from N.S. about Coleridge. The train only goes so far as Peckham. (Theres the all clear, I rather think). Mrs Chavasse says someone left London at 6: arrived at 2 am. We go up on Monday to salvage & see John. Mabel is said to have nailed curtains over the windows. A bomb in Gordon Sqre. All windows at 46 broken. L. has written to ask the Bedfords to remit our rent [of 52 Tavistock Square]. If refused, we mean to tackle the Duke, & ventilate in the papers. Very still & warm today. So invasion becomes possible. Smoke was going up like a picture on the house over the hill in Piddinghoe. The river high; all softly blue & milky: autumn quiet—12 planes in perfect order, back from the fight, pass overhead. Last night I read a potted version of my USA article. Quentin very burly & male. Mrs West prefers not to have money. A woman shd. stay at home. Miss Gardner amiable & silly but handsome. Fears [the postman] admitted: the wage earner keeps a perk for himself. A scattered discussion. How odd if one cd strip the flesh & see the various motives function."
1940.09.25,"It must have been the next day that the Anrep crisis happened. They had taken the cottage, Nessa told me, indefinitely: Helen & the 2 oafs. Then I lost my temper, more than for years. Sure enough they came on Monday. Had I time I would detail my great philosophic scheme for organising emotions for the length of their stay. Every fortnight a decorous tea. A letter to Helen explaining … & so on. Then, like a Star arising, Nessa wrote (we are cold & distant, after our wrangle) that they stay only a week. Well—I cannot now dissect my maneuvres. All day—Monday—in London I was composing my attitude; in the flat; dark; carpets nailed to windows; ceilings down in patches; heaps of grey dust & china under kitchen table; back rooms untouched. A lovely Septr day—tender—three days of tender weather—John came. We are moved to Letchworth. The Garden City was moving us that day. Roger surprisingly sells. The bomb in Brunswick Sqre exploded. I was in the bakers. Comforted the agitated worn women. Then letters, from Arthur Ponsonby & Lord Bicester & Christabel from the choked maw of the post office. So home. And now, constricted by the Anreps in the village, I plan a tea say Saturday; clench my teeth, shut my eyes; & after that, to the peace of this empty house, & renewed country. Invasion again withdraws."
1940.09.26,"A rather strained talk on the phone with Nessa. She hasn’t forgiven the Anrep conversation;—damn Helen for once more moving herself into an impregnable position. However, Nessa held the Trump card. “Both our studios have been destroyed. The roofs fallen in. Still burning. Pictures burnt.” So I had to pipe low. My fallen ceilings a trifle. Helen a mares nest. Our strategy was to invite the A.s & the B.s to the same tea. The A.s accept rapturously. So therell be 3 very unpleasant hours on Saturday. I must prepare my behaviour. Think of things to say. Gathering apples all the afternoon. German raider comes over. Shots fired at Asheham. Bombs towards Seaford. Writing to Ld Ponsonby I remain unmoved. Only a German bomber? Oh thats all—No I didn’t look out—Consider this remark last year—still more, 10 years, still more 50 years ago. In flush with PH. thank God: & The Listener suggests a review. So I’m nose to the grindstone; the perfect antidote to Anreps.

I never mentioned Ken Sheppard, the unknown soldier. But must return to Michelet."
1940.09.29,"A bomb dropped so close I cursed L. for slamming the window. I was writing to Hugh, & the pen jumped from my fingers. Raid still on. Its like a sheep dog, chasing a fox out of the fold—you see them yapping & biting & then the marauder, dropping a bone, a bomb towards Newhaven, flies. All Clear. Bowls. Villagers at their doors. Cold. All now become familiar. I was thinking: (among other things) that this is a lazy life. Breakfast in bed. Read in bed. Bath. Order dinner. Out to Lodge. After rearranging my room (turning table to get the sun: Church on right; window left; a new very lovely view) tune up, with cigarette: write till 12; stop; visit L.: look at papers; return; type till 1. Listen in. Lunch. Sore jaw. Cant bite. Read papers. Walk to Southease. Back 3. Gather & arrange apples. Tea. Write a letter. Bowls. Type again. Read Michelet & write here. Cook dinner. Music. Embroidery. 9.30 read (or sleep) till 11.30. Bed. Compare with the old London day. Three afternoons someone coming. One night, dinner party. Saturday a walk. Thursday shopping. Tuesday going to tea with Nessa. One City walk. Telephone ringing. L. to meetings. KM. or Robson bothering—that was an average week; with Friday to Monday here.

I think, now we’re marooned, I ought to cram in a little more reading. Yet why? A happy, a very free, & disengaged—a life that rings from one simple melody to another. Yes; why not enjoy this after all those years of the other? Yet I compare with Miss Perkins day. At 58 Miss P. may live as I do.

Anreps yesterday. Easy & familiar & friendly. The brats [omission] astonishingly rude to Helen, to whom therefore I relented. Both treat her as a menial, a servant, an imbecile. Both very callow, callous, rattling & over emphatic—unrestrained; embryos, unlicked cubs. Ba goes to the pub at night. Ba attacked Phoebe Poole [an Oxford contemporary]. She wants to go back to London. An undisciplined, unschooled & not very attractive or seductive mind. Crude & raw. Both of course young—& so have vitality. Helen their slave.

Nessa rang up. A statue & frigidaire alone salved."
1940.10.02,"Ought I not to look at the sunset rather than write this? A flush of red in the blue; the haystack in the marsh catches the glow; behind me, the apples are red in the trees. L. is gathering them. Now a plume of smoke goes from the train under Cabum. And all the air a solemn stillness holds. till 8.30 when the cadaverous twanging in the sky begins; the planes going to London. Well its an hour still to that. Cows feeding. The elm tree sprinkling its little leaves against the sky. Our pear tree swagged with pears; & the weathercock above the triangular church tower above it. Why try again to make the familiar catalogue, from which something escapes. Should I think of death? Last night a great heavy plunge of bomb under the window. So near we both started. A plane had passed dropping this fruit. We went onto the terrace. Trinkets of stars sprinkled & glittering. All quiet. The bombs dropped on Itford Hill. There are two by the river, marked with white wooden crosses, still unburst. I said to L.: I dont want to die yet. The chances are against it. But theyre aiming at the railway & the power works. They get closer every time. Caburn was crowned with what looked a settled moth, wings extended—a Messerschmitt it was, shot down on Sunday.

I had a nice gallop this morning with Coleridge—Sara. I’m to make £20 with 2 articles. Books still held up. And Spiras free, & Margot writes to say ‘I did it’ & adds, “a long letter all about yourself & what you believe.” What do I? Cant at the moment remember. Oh I try to imagine how one’s killed by a bomb. I’ve got it fairly vivid—the sensation: but cant see anything but suffocating nonentity following after. I shall think—oh I wanted another 10 years—not this—& shant, for once, be able to describe it. It—I mean death; no, the scrunching & scrambling, the crushing of my bone shade in on my very active eye & brain: the process of putting out the light,—painful? Yes. Terrifying. I suppose so—Then a swoon; a drum; two or three gulps attempting consciousness—& then, dot dot dot"
1940.10.06,"I snatch this page with Anreps & Ruth Beresford imminent to say—what? Will it ever seem strange that L. & I walking on the marsh first look at a bomb crater: then listen to the German drone above: then I take 2 paces nearer L., prudently deciding that 2 birds had better be killed with one stone? They got Lewes at last yesterday. Eleven bombs Percy says—not one of em drawing blood; only sheds, graveyards & windows. We discount Percy. But its indisputable—the crater in the field by the line. Two or three crashes today. A very stormy huddled clouded day. Favourable for hiding planes. Wild geese on the river. So I say. L. says Cormorants. But my old St Ives sea sense scouts that.

I’m earning £30 this week. 2 Coleridges; Sitwells. And cant help running them all into a book, in & out, round & round I shall thread a necklace through English life & lit. But no, I wont let myself reel it off. Never had a better writing season. P.H. in fact pleases me; & so little to do now. Many letters to write. Lord Bicester introduces the Morgans, who are deeply distressed by Roger. But I cant write with Anreps imminent. Praise be, they go tomorrow. Yet I like Baba—perking up so fresh & spouting through that crooked spout her nose: alive; foolish. Helen of course,—well, I dont like the suppliant; yet cant see how she cd. better it. The weak are the wrong doers, as old Waller [Jack Hills] once said. The drifters that foul the nets. Only—only—I see too many sides now, growing old. Whats she to do, being a drifter? Vita on Wednesday. I think I could stuff this hole—oh the Anreps—as I cant bowl in this gale—with Michelet. I’m tired of article writing."
1940.10.10,"Rather flush of ideas, because I have had an idle day, a non-writing day—what a relief once in a way—a Vita talking day. About what? Oh the war; bombs; which house hit, which not; then Ben’s attack; then our books—all very ample easy & satisfying. She has a hold on life, knows plants & their minds & bodies, lunches with Prince Bernhart, makes a curtsey to the wrong man “I am Robert of Austria”—washes up with R. of A. & is generally slack & abundant & wholly without the little artists back kitchen smell, so perceptible in Helen, large & tolerant & modest, with her hands loosely upon so many reins: sons; Harold; garden; farm. Humorous too, & deeply, I mean awkwardly, dumbly affectionate. I’m glad that our love has weathered so well. She drove us to Lewes; a great storm; car incommoded; siren sounded as we left her at the crossroads. A wave of her hand; she drives off in her leggings brown velvet coat & yellow shirt grown, I suppose people wd. say, rather heavy & blowsy; her eyes less lustrous; her cheeks spread—but so careless of it all, it dont matter. So we walked home across the marsh. How free, how peaceful we are. No one coming. No servant. Dine when we like. Living near to the bone. I think we’ve mastered life rather competently.

I was thinking of Mabel’s history. Her friend has died. Could I write it, how profoundly succulent it wd be. The cold pear shaped woman: her suppressed country childhood: no its her life with Charles that interests me. He was ‘on his own.’ Did a good deal of shady dealing I imagine. Lived in lodgings kept by an old lady near Elephant & Castle. Used to eat raw tripe—being from Yorkshire. A typical underworld card. He made a good deal at dog races. He wd take Mabel to race after race. How did they meet? He was life & romance to her. Why didnt they marry? Had he a wife? Every spare day I wd find him a solid red face grizzled man in his shirtsleeves—perhaps helping to wash up. His other passion was the Opera. He knew them all by heart. For hours they wd stand in a queue, at the Old Vic &c. She knew all the tunes. What a queer relationship—she so dumb & passive yet following him; maternally proud of him, to races, to plays: following the form of horses; always with something on. I gave him 3 lemons⁠[?]; but I also made her come down here, when he was ill—Lord, the bloodless servitude of the domestic poor! Now she’s been “as near death as can be”—the flats toppling on to their shelter. It is something like an Arnold Bennett novel the life of the bastard woman; her subterranean London life, with this ‘friend’ as she called him. Charles Stanford I think his name was—Charles will do—or wont do—She thought of him as of a small impetuous boy. Now his life is over; & no one will know more than I do about Charles & Mabel."
1940.10.12,"I would like to pack my day rather fuller: most reading must be munching. If it were not treasonable to say so, a day like this is almost too—I wont say happy: but amenable. The tune varies, from one nice melody to another. All is played (today) in such a theatre. Hills & fields; I cant stop looking; October blooms; brown plough; & the fading & freshening of the marsh. Now the mist comes up. And one things ‘pleasant’ after another: breakfast, writing, walking, tea, bowls, reading, sweets, bed. A letter from Rose about her day. I let it almost break mine. Mine recovers. The globe rounds again. Behind it—oh yes. But I was thinking I must intensify. Partly Rose. Partly I’m terrified of passive acquiescence. I live in intensity. In London, now, or 2 years ago, I’d be owling through the streets. More pack & thrill than here. So I must supply that—how? I think book making inventing. And there’s always the chance of a rough wave: no, I wont once more turn my magnifying glass on that. Scraps of memoirs come so coolingly to my mind. Wound up by those 3 little articles (one sent today) I unwound a page about Thoby.

Fish forgotten, I must invent a dinner. But its all so heavenly free & easy—L. & I alone. We raised Louie’s wages to 15/- from 12/- this week. She is as rosy & round as a small boy tipped. I’ve my rug on hand too. Another pleasure. And all the clothes drudgery, Sybil drudgery, society drudgery obliterated. But I want to look back on these war years as years of positive something or other. L. gathering apples. Sally barks. I imagine a village invasion. Queer the contraction of life to the village radius. Wood bought eno’ to stock many winters. All our friends are isolated over winter fires. Letters from Angelica & Bunny &. Chance of interruption small now. No cars. No petrol. Trains uncertain. And we on our lovely free autumn island. But I will read Dante, & for my trip thro’ English lit book. I was glad to see the C.R. all spotted with readers at the Free Library to wh. I think of belonging."
1940.10.17,"Our private luck has turned. John says Tavistock Sqre is no more. If thats so, I need no longer wake in the night thinking the Wolves luck has taken a downward turn. For the first time they were rash & foolish. Second, an urgent request from Harpers Bazaar for an article or story. So that tree, far from being barren, as I thought, is fruit bearing. And I’ve spent I dont know how much brain nerve earning £30 gs. with 3 little articles. But I say, the effort has its reward; for I’m worth, owing to that insect like conscience & diligence, £120 to the USA.

A perfect day—a red admiral feasting on an apple day. A red rotten apple lying in the grass; butterfly on it, beyond a soft blue warm coloured down & field. Everything dropping through soft air to rest on the earth. The light is now fading. Soon the Siren; then the twang of plucked strings … But its almost forgettable still; the nightly operation on the tortured London; Mabel wants to leave it. L. sawing wood. The funny little cross on the Church shows against the downs. We go up tomorrow. A mist is rising; a long fleece of white on the marshes. I must black out. I had so much to say. I am filling my mind slowly with E⁠[lizabe]⁠thans, that is to say letting my mind feed like the Red Admiral—the Siren, just as I had drawn the curtains. Now the unpleasant part begins. Who’ll be killed tonight? Not us, I suppose. One doesn’t think of that—save as a quickener. Indeed I often think our Indian summer was deserved: after all those London years. I mean, this quickens it. Every day seen against a very faint shade of bodily risk.

But to continue—Ly Oxford writes a crude grasping letter. Ethel, having done her usual trick—sympathy, I must have sympathy—forgets & owns she’s alive, in fact, bustling; so why be taken in by the extroverts ever again? They scream to rouse an echo—like Hugh, Ethel must must be heard. Vita sent a broken po, & Jacobs sheep wool. Not an extrovert. And I returned to PH today; & am to transfer my habitual note taking I think—what I do on odd days—to Random reading. The idea is, accumulate notes. Oh & I’ve mastered the iron curtain for my brain. Down I shut when I’m tied tight. No reading no writing. No claims, no ‘must’. I walk—yesterday in the rain over, the Piddinghoe down—a new line."
1940.10.20,"The most—what?—impressive, no, thats not it—sight in London on Friday was the queue, mostly children with suitcases, outside Warren St tube. This was about 11.30. We thought they were evacuees, waiting for a bus. But there they were, in a much longer line, with women, men, more bags & blankets, sitting still at 3. Lining up for the shelter in the nights raid—which came of course. Thus, if they left the tube at 6 (a bad raid on Thursday) they were back again at 11. So to Tavistock Sq. With a sigh of relief saw a heap of ruins. Three houses, I shd. say gone. Basement all rubble. Only relics an old basket chair (bought in Fitzroy Sqre days) & Penmans board To Let. Otherwise bricks & wood splinters. One glass door in the next door house hanging. I cd just see a piece of my studio wall standing: otherwise rubble where I wrote so many books. Open air where we sat so many nights, gave so many parties. The hotel not touched. So to Meck. All again litter, glass, black soft dust, plaster powder. Miss Talbot & Miss Edwards in trousers, overalls, & turbans, sweeping. I noted the flutter of Miss T.’s hands: the same as Miss Perkins. Of course friendly & hospitable in the extreme. Jaunty jerky talk. Repetitions. So sorry we hadnt had her card … to save you the shock. Its awful … Upstairs she propped a leaning bookcase for us. Books all over dining room floor. In my sitting room glass all over Mrs Hunter’s cabinet—& so on. Only the drawing room with windows almost whole. A wind blowing through. I began to hunt out diaries. What cd we salvage in this little car? Darwin, & the Silver, & some glass & china. Then, I on my chair hunting, Mabel came. As discreet & matronly as ever. Rather finer & sadder. I arranged that she shd. come here for a fortnight. She too almost, in her very trained servant way, overcome. Our house, she said, like a monkeys house. Hadnt had her clothes off since she left. And going to the hospital—here she paused. “You hear them whistling round you, you wonder is it our turn next?” The flats had fallen on top of her shelter. Anxious of course to sweep to recover my fur coat. I worked with her in the kitchen packing Duncan’s glasses, Nessa’s plates. Very friendly, devoted, her training as helper uppermost. Offered her fare. She refused. (And she hasnt come, greatly to our relief—Oh the pleasure of the empty house—of the ship in wh. we’re the crew …) Then lunch off tongue, in the drawing room. John came. I forgot the Voyage of the Beagle. No raid the whole day. So about 2.30 drove home. L. says £10 wd cover our damage. Cheered on the whole by London. Damage in Bloomsbury considerable. 3 houses out in Caroline Place: but miles & miles of Hyde Park, Oxford & Cambridge Terrace, & Queens Gate untouched. Now we seem quit of London.

Plans for buying a house in Lewes & storing our furniture. Perhaps hiring rooms for our books at the Rectory. Exhilaration at losing possessions—save at times I want my books & chairs & carpets & beds—How I worked to buy them—one by one—And the pictures. But to be free of Meck, wd now be a relief. Almost certainly it will be destroyed—& our queer tenancy of that sunny flat over … In spite of the move & the expense, no doubt, if we save our things, we shall be cheaply quit—I mean, if we’d stayed at 52 & lost all our possessions. But its odd—the relief at losing possessions. I shd like to start life, in peace, almost bare—free to go anywhere. Can we be rid of Meck tho’?

Nessa to tea yesterday. Talk of a farmhouse at Chalverton?—for A. & B. I at once long to buy it—Checked by L. Tomorrow we go to Lewes & house agents.

I must add that today is as hot as August: walked on downs; heard gunfire at Dover?—shelling Calais; summer clothes; L. cleaning beds. Too hot for fire. Mist rising, must black out."
1940.10.22,"Mabel has come. I thought I heard a rat gnawing when I came in from the marsh. Strode into the kitchen & found her there. So all our solitude is gone. There she is, passive, dependant. And how to make a move? Seems impossible. The old weight of respectable damp despair is on me. L. says she’s positively cheered by Charles’ death—after an operation at Tooting. “I could envy him” she said to me this morning. “They say I’ve grown fatter—sitting doing nothing”

To Lewes. Asked the rent of Yew Tree house—£110, with a view to buying & storing. Denny Botten has rooms. Mrs Ebbs has a stable. Mrs Ebbs always reads “your wife’s books. But doesn’t understand them—for the beautiful English.” I wish I didn’t play bowls, & cd. settle in & write calmly or read. As it is, in I rush, having irritated L. who said he had bad luck; I won the 2nd game—too hasty to do more than black out before dinner.

Mable somewhere secretively observant. The vast ideas that float are never caught. I thought: how L. sees people in the mass: I singly. I thought biography is like the rim of sea anemones left round the shore in Gosse’s Father & Son [1907]: I thought Beresford, Ruth’s father, has been killed by a bomb: I thought, I will write supports & additions for my old TLS articles; a good deal about manners, & our class; about my rug (L. sneezes in the wc. I jump;) about a prayer for the V⁠[ictoria]⁠n scene in P.H.; no reply from Harpers. Gramophone mended but bad; if I wait the thought may return; a lovely almost a red admiral & apple day; 24 vols of diary salved; a great mass for my memoirs. The lazy talk of pregnant women—to wit, Mrs Cruttenden in the bakers shop; lou⁠[n]⁠ged out & stood in the sun; & now I will light the fire, as L. comes in with the logs. And so, rug, reading, music, bed."
1940.10.23,"Heard the whistle of bombs for the first time today. About 5—windy cloudy: playing bowls. Suddenly heard a plane: suddenly heard a whistle. Like a toy pig escaping—rather: Then I saw smoke, over the field path. Then 4 separate thuds—said to be at Iford & by the new house opposite Northease. Went into village. What about the children, said Annie’s sister in law. Then Annie & two children appeared. In the bus from Lewes they had seen the bombs fall near. No one hurt—as far as known. L. now holding agricultural meeting. How instinctive the mothers reaction is! The children … off she ran. Jaded with story spinning fr. an empty well in reply to 2 more letters from H⁠[arper’s]. B⁠[azaar]."
1940.10.26,"“The complete Insider”—I have just coined this title to express my feeling towards George Trevelyan; who has been made Master of Trinity: whose history of England I began after tea (throwing aside Michelet vol. 15 with a glorious sense of my own free & easiness in reading now). Herbert Fisher is another. So (with a ‘perhaps’) is Maynard. They are Romans not Greeks. I like outsiders better. Insiders write a colourless English. They are turned out by the University machine. I respect them. Father was one variety. I dont love them. I dont savour them. Insiders are the glory of the 19th century. They do a great service like Roman roads. But they avoid the forests & the will o the wisps.

Rather a harassed day yesterday—Leslie Humphreys: carrying the bust of Sir James. He climbs. He’s agile. He’s communicative. But a bore—or will be—a garrulous bore. At the same time he part touched, part flattered me by his little private talk about Judith. How she refers “things to you & Leonard. You’ve got hold of something worth having.” He pools his Bank balance with her: is proud, worshipping, of her; says she suffers, from a sense of guilt. Provides her I suppose with confidence & the normal. But he irritated L.: & Mabel has trod on L.’s spectacles; & the Frys will have her. Too cold for more."
1940.10.29,"Rather than wash my head I will here record (it has taken me 10 minutes to fit new sheets into this book) a London day. Up by train. Saying a chill early morning good bye to Mabel, who’s gone to Isabel Fry [one of Roger’s sisters]. Train luxurious & fast. Bus 18 waiting. Very little new damage. City looked untouched. The flat wind swept. So walked—all our part pitted & scarred. At 52 we saw the panels still pendant—3 at least. The scavenger talked to us about Sally—L.’s old fine trusty crone. To buy wool. So round the squares home. Cold sausages in the cold room. Salvaged a few books off the floor. Pritchard had his gardener up with a spade. Much lamented our carpet inches deep in plaster & glass. L. to the Fabians [in Westminster]. I by some hanky panky on part of my watch so late—5 to the ½ hour in Piccadilly—had to jump into a taxi. St James Church a shell; also the shop opposite. Ruins in Leicester Sqre. Crater in front of the Palace. Willie & L. standing outside Fabians, to Victoria. Air raid sounded. Sat there for ¾ hour. No guns. So home. And how happy—several letters—one from the woman gardener, who has never read anything so disgusting as p. 34 in R.F.; book (E.F. Benson) from Times: wood fire & thats all. Today I cycled to Newhaven—City of the Dead. Sepulchred shops empty; silent, dour men. Baker boasted of the raid—at 5.30 yesterday 25 Germans descended: dropped 25 bombs—houses ruined—little girl killed. “And not a Spitfire any where near ..” The gloomy self consequence of the newly bombed. Home by Tarring Neville. The loveliest of low views."
1940.11.01,"A gloomy evening, spiritually: alone over the fire—L. in bed with influenza cold: caught off Percy. So I am alone; & by way of conversation, apply to this too stout volume.

My Times book this week is E. F. Benson’s last autobiography—in which he tried to rasp himself clean of his barnacles. I learn there the perils of glibness. I too can flick phrases. He said “One must discover new depths in oneself.” Well I dont bother about that here. I will note, tho’, the perils of glibness. And add, considering how I feel in my fingers the weight of every word, even of a review, need I feel guilty?

The relics of my distracted morning—I had to ring up Miss Talbot—who was to come tomorrow—&c &c, were spent tightening that wretched £150 story, The Legacy. Well, I combed & tidied it—so far as ‘it’ has any hair on its head. Then dipped into my memoirs: too circuitous & unrelated: too many splutters: as it stands. A real life has no crisis: hence nothing to tighten. It must lack centre. It must amble on. All the same, I can weave a very thick pattern, one of these days, out of that pattern of detail. Then I carried L.’s lunch. Then I pumped my bicycle. Then I rode to Lewes. I saw a chocolate velvet Bradfield, & slid past. Early in the morning Annie came, asked me to stand for W.I. Cttee. “No” I cried too violently. The poor dont understand humour. I repented; went round later & found her in the sunny parlour with all the sisters⁠[?] artificial carnations, & said I would. For I could see, by the pleasure she felt when I offered to nominate her, that she takes this infernal dull bore seriously: its an excitement. Two white Penfold brats. They run out like dogs she said chasing them. If one lives in a village, one had better snatch its offerings. Miss Talbot rang up. Sister too shy to come. Arranged both will come—oh dear—next week. And the raid was bad last night. At 3 am. a bomb dropped 2 doors off—seriously hurt a man. She said it was an English shell, unexploded. The Italians, she says, are practising: nosing in the dark—as they did t’other night here. This very simple self-conversation had better end with the page—paper being scarce, & so on.

I forgot to say that I heard of Hilda Matheson’s death today from Ethel. But she calls up no image."
1940.11.03,"Yesterday the river burst its banks. The marsh is now a sea with gulls on it. L. (recovered) & I walked down to the hanger. Water broken, white, roaring, pouring down through the gap by the pill box. A bomb had exploded last month; old Thompsett told me it took a month to mend. For some reason (bank weakened Everest says by pill box) it burst again. Today the rain is tremendous. And gale. As if dear old nature were kicking up her heels. Down to the hanger again. Flood deeper & fuller. Bridge cut off. Water made road impassable by the farm. So all my marsh walks are gone—until? Another break in the bank. It comes over in a cascade: the sea is unfathomable. Yes, now it has crept up round Botten’s haystack—the haystack in the floods—& is at the bottom of our field. Lovely if the sun were out. Medieval in the mist tonight.

T’other night cooking alone, Freeth came. Light showing. A plane overhead (It was bright starlight). Later, P.C. Collins. Here I observed the official bully. So ‘rude’: so rasping; the working man male dressed up. Gave me a dressing down. Threatened. Scolded. What a chance to give a lady a bit of his mind! When theyre not respectful, theyve no “manners” to fall back on: only original—well not savagery, nor brutality: bully is the fittest. Every night you show a light. No other house does. Next time—prison, fine, indicated. I tried my lady battery on him. No good. Mr Woolf in bed—thats why. No good. So I took notes of him too: useful this breach in the bank of class manners. Anyhow we spent 4 hours stitching curtains yesterday. L. still hanging. And Mary H. on the phone, asking to bring Franzetti tomorrow. I am happy, quit of my money making; back at P.H. writing in spurts: covering, I’m glad to say, a small canvas. Oh the freedom—"
1940.11.05,"The haystack in the floods is of such incredible beauty … When I look up I see all the marsh water. In the sun deep blue, gulls caraway seeds: snowberries⁠[?]: atlantic flier: yellow islands: leafless trees: red cottage roofs. Oh may the flood last for ever—a virgin lip; no bungalows; as it was in the beginning. So we showed it to Mary & Mrs Hamilton (an Italian; formerly married to Franchetti). Now its lead grey with the red leaves in front, our island sea. Caburn is become a cliff.

I was thinking: the University fills shells like H.A.L.F. & Trevelyan. They are their product. Also: never have I been so fertile. Also: the old hunger for books is on me: the childish passion So that I am very ‘happy’ as the saying is: & excited by PH. This diary shorthand comes in useful. A new style—to mix.

Yvonne knew Rezia. She now dreads germs. Covers her hands to shake hands. A very dull life in the Palazzo Corsini. Nerino a doctor. Was with the Huxleys & Sullivan when Ott & Pip came. Ott bathing in pink tights with a great hat. I liked her when I found she was Italian. Mary like a jennet—a mare with ears laid back. I liked her. Jimmy Sheehan drinks. All the young English drink spirits. I like wine. Air raids much less. Greeks holding out. Prospect more hopeful. A crybaby letter from John. Doing the work of 3 men for 2$—all our fault. This his reaction to his own folly in poaching Auden. Auden has cried off—taking John’s £100. Hamish Hamilton a publisher. Publishes Mrs Thirkell. Mr Hanna arrives with L.’s [A.R.P.] armlet: violet silk with gold letters. Oh the black out wh. nips me in the bud. Miss Pound out with the Canadian. The Canadian playing a game in the road as I ordered dinner. Estimate from Carvills [of Lewes] for bringing furniture £25. No letters—only Denny. And so to read George Trevelyan the perfect product of the Universities."
1940.11.07,"Morgan asks if he may propose me for the L⁠[ondon] L⁠[ibrary] Committee. Rather to my pleasure I answered No. I dont want to be a sop—a face saver. This was a nice little finish to a meeting with EMF years ago in the L.L. He sniffed about women on Cttee. One of these days I’ll refuse I said silently. And now I have. Here is L. so I stop. Bad bombing last night—4 thuds: at 7—said to be Glyndebourne. London tomorrow Oh Lord the Talbots for the weekend.

Morgan asked me to stand for L.L. Committee. I refused."
1940.11.12,"Chamberlain is dead: & if we hold on till March we have broken the back (or whatever the phrase is). These two facts sum up the papers. I could add about Greece … Hitler’s speech … no: time goes so heavy & slow, that nothing marks the days. A bomb fell at lunch yesterday. There is nothing new. Eastbourne bombed. London. I am shirking, in these semi public utterances, the Talbot character. I had it on the tip of my tongue. [omission]"
1940.11.15,"As I cannot write if anyone is in the room, as L. sits here when we light the fire, this book remains shut. A natural slimming process. A screw over the end of P H. made me rather sink into the disillusions yesterday. We have been a bit pressed. Michael MacCarthy to lunch; L.’s [WEA] lecture; Nessa to lunch—2 hard shopping days, in one of wh. I bought blue serge slacks—all this has rattled my head; so I plunged into the past this morning; wrote about father; & then we walked in top boots & trousers through the flood. Increased again. Lewes this evening with 2 lights showing looks like a harbour—like a French town spreading its skirts round a bay. I had a gaping raw wound too reading my essay in N.W. Why did I? Why come to the top when I suffer so in that light?

Coventry almost destroyed. The usual traffic last night. All the hounds on their road to London. A bad raid there. When I am not writing fiction this fact seeps in. The necessity of living in the upper air. Then I tidied my room & threw masses on to the potato box for Louie. This also revives. I am a mental specialist now. I will enjoy every single day. We took 2 rooms at Botten’s. I am always behindhand with letters. I am reading Read’s Auty: a tight packed unsympathetic mind, all good cabinet making. And pin my faith still to Trevy’s history. And now return to that. Wind rising. So perhaps the traffic will be interrupted."
1940.11.17,"I observe, as a curious trifle in mental history—I shd like to take naturalists notes—human naturalists notes—that it is the rhythm of a book that, by running in the head, winds one into a ball: & so jades one. The rhythm of PH. (the last chapter) became so obsessive that I heard it, perhaps used it, in every sentence I spoke. By reading the notes for memoirs I broke this up. The rhythm of the notes is far freer & looser. Two days of writing in that rhythm has completely refreshed me. So I go back to PH tomorrow. This I think is rather profound.

Butter stolen yesterday; Louie says “You are too well liked for any villager to take it—Had it been Mr Coates…” This flatters us. A fight over Knotts Bushes. 6 little companies of exclamation marks. Supposed to be the shrapnel after the air gun shell. Two loud explosions. A great chase, & all the farm out watching. Dumb Thompsett making wild attempts at comment. Flood even higher. And the plumes of the sky in the water—& the wild birds—& L. cut down the rusty funereal trees today. And I lost the saw. I cannot fix my mind to details. The butter disappeared when we were playing bowls. A mans voice heard, & the card of St Dunstan’s found in the door. Assumption then that the voluntary Collector took it.

A Canadian soldier stole Peter’s bicycle pump. Two Miss Pounds left the house holding nothing in their hands. Mrs Chavasse—I’m a lone woman—always sleeps in her shelter—a cellar, dripping wet—Lord!—"
1940.11.18,"These queer little sand castles, I was thinking; I was finishing Herbert Read’s autobiography this morning at breakfast. Little boys making sand castles. This refers to H. Read; Tom Eliot; Santayana; Wells. Each is weathertight, & gives shelter to the occupant. I think I can follow Read’s building; so far as one can follow what one cannot build. But I am the sea which demolishes these castles. I use this image; meaning that owing to Read’s article on Roger, his self that built the castle is to me destructive of its architecture. A mean, spiteful Read dwells outside. What is the value of a philosophy which has no power over life? I have the double vision. I mean, as I am not engrossed in the labour of making this intricate word structure I also see the man who makes it. I should say it is only word proof not weather proof. We have to discover the natural law & live by it. We are anarchists: We take the leap (glory that is) from what we know to the instinctive. This is his defence of romanticism, of sur-realism. His selection from literature is: Flaubert, Henry James, Blake, Wordsworth. All we at the moment can do is to make these selections: like dogs seeking the grass that cures us. But of course, being a tower dweller, Read then walls them in, others out. Plato of course did not write reviews for The Spectator. I can thus endow him with a purity that is impossible when I know that little Read attacks Roger. Little Read is the image in the face of a pasty boardschool boy. Is this word “little” inevitable of the living? I am carrying on, while I read, the idea of women discovering, like the 19th century rationalists, agnostics, that man is no longer God. My position, ceasing to accept the religion, is quite unlike Read’s, Wells’, Tom’s, or Santayana’s. It is essential to remain outside; & realise my own beliefs: or rather not to accept theirs. A line to think out."
1940.11.23,"Having this moment finished The Pageant—or Poyntz Hall?—(begun perhaps April 1938) my thoughts turn, well up, to write the first chapter of the next book (nameless). Anon, it will be called. The exact narrative of this last morning should refer to Louie’s interruption, holding a glass jar, in whose thin milk was a pat of butter. Then I went in with her to skim the milk off: then I took the pat & showed it to Leonard. This was a moment of great household triumph.

I am a little triumphant about the book. I think its an interesting attempt in a new method. I think its more quintessential than the others. More milk skimmed off. A richer pat, certainly a fresher than that misery The Years. I’ve enjoyed writing almost every page. This book was only (I must note) written at intervals when the pressure was at its highest, during the drudgery of Roger. I think I shall make this then my scheme: if the new book can be made to serve as daily drudgery—only I hope to lessen that—anyhow it will be a supported on fact book—then I shall brew some moments of high pressure. I think of taking my mountain top—that persistent vision—as a starting point. Then see what comes. If nothing, it wont matter.

To lunch with B. & A. at Claverham yesterday. B. was surly from the start. A. a little spotty. Also nervous. I got a little solitary gossip in the chimney corner. But its not the old family ease. B. suspects the family influence. B. dislikes the house. No room to swing a cat in he grumbled. “But I rather like the country.” I, of course, at once saw the country as something I envied. We lost our way. Up a lane we went to a tree shadowed house, with a pond; & a swan; & a curious thatched barn, with small Gothic windows. I waited in the car. Such antiquity all gone to pieces. Some old farm waggons, some ploughs; a battered car in the yard. L. was wrongly directed. I knocked again; & an old buck in riding breeches—blue eyed, nair netted, munching her solitary lunch, came out. I noticed the ancient bits, walking sticks; & also the very fine panelled door. C⁠[laverham]. farm house is in the fields. It has a pond. Long tracks of grass. Red plumed woods in the distance. And four hollow trees. Also a barn. I cd have fancied living there; it has a marble bath & W.C.: many rooms; thick walls; tiled passages; central heating. But they said it was betwixt & between: nothing in itself. When I think of Monks House when we took it—when I think of the E⁠[arth] C⁠[loset] in the garden; & the cane chair over a bucket, & the dogs barking; & how I hated the village—which has now become familiar & even friendly—arent I on the Cttee of the WI—dont I go to a meeting on Monday?—then I wd have given my eyes to live in Claverham, with the fields, & the green paths, & the farm horses ploughing. L. however saw none of this. In fact, A.’s position, with B. as her mentor, struck us both as almost grotesque—a distortion: a dream; for how can she endure Bottom. And when will she wake? So we drove back to the civilisation of Lewes, & I bought my cream separator: a sieve with which you skim the milk.

The flood is less today—as Q. & Elizabeth Watson lunch tomorrow to see it. No word from John. The L.T. article starred in a Lit. Sup. leader. Am I again in favour? Yesterday a raider came popping over the hill: L. saw a smoke rise. In fact it was shot down at Tarring Neville. Louie says the country people “stomped” the heads of the 4 dead Germans into the earth."
1940.11.29,"Many many deep thoughts have visited me. And fled. The pen puts salt on their tails; they see the shadow & fly. I was thinking about vampires. Leeches. Anyone with 500 a year & education, is at once sucked by the leeches. Put L. & me into Rodmell pool & we are sucked sucked—sucked. I see the reason for those who suck guineas. But life—ideas—thats a bit thick. We’ve exchanged the clever for the simple. The simple envy us our life. Last night L.’s lecture attracted Suckers. Gwen Thompsett is a sucker. (L. is getting logs so I cant write). From this to manners:—a thought to keep for my book.

John has written—wobbly: wants lime light & bouquets. 3rd imp. of Roger: & I not told.

Very busy this last week. To London: Bella & Tom. The last of 37 as a residence: furniture arrives on Monday. Leech Octavia asks to come. B. & A. tomorrow. Now I must read Ellen Terry."
1940.12.06,"And then what they call real life broke in. Vans arrived in a deluge. Oh, we unpacked standing in the rain. And the Bottens did the dirty on us. Result: MH. gorged with old jugs & lidless pots. And the Christian room laden with 4 tons of old damp books. Real life is a helter skelter, healthy for the mind doubtless. I cant climb up to the other life in a hurry. I see what a working womans life is. No time to think. A breeze ruffles the surface. No silence. I cannot concentrate upon E. Terry partly because I’m not sure of my audience in Harper’s.

Quentin last night; urbane & happy. Fears told us the story of South African war—war seen from the ground by the private. A childs eye view. Rather depressing—old papers, letters, notebooks: I’m going to bind the survivors tonight; & in coloured paper they may refresh my eye. All this writing—what a deluge of words I’ve let loose—on paper only: I mean not printed. And must now climb a low rung—Trevy—up towards my heights."
1940.12.08,"I have only five minutes after a struggle with Ellen Terry to say that the war—yes I have left only 5 minutes to fill in that omission—the war goes on; In ten years I shall ask, what was happening to the war? It is better. The Greeks are driving the Italians out of Albania. Perhaps this is the turning point in the war. But it dribbles out in such little drops. One cant always catch them. The war slowly enacts itself on a great scene: round our little scene. We spend 59 minutes here; one minute there. Badoglio has resigned. And if we beat Italy we beat Germany. It is a cold windy winter day."
1940.12.16,"Exhausted with the long struggle of writing 2,000 about Ellen Terry,—interrupted by 4 days of furniture moving—distracted by the chaotic state of our possessions—oh the huddle & hideousness of untidiness—oh that Hitler had obliterated all our books tables carpets & pictures—oh that we were empty & bare & unpossessed—I take my pen to drawl & drowse a little. The year draws to an end; & I am harassed, damp: but I am relieved of a visit from Margot; & so will take the matter in hand: scrub & polish & discard: & make our life here as taut & bright & vigorous as it can be.

Its rather a hard lap: the winter lap. So cold often. And so much work to do. And so little fat to cook with. And so much shopping to do. And one has to weigh & measure. Then Kingsley comes & devours sugar & butter. I will write memoirs, I think: then Reading at Random. Measure, order, precision are now my gods. Even my hand shakes. We have the kitten. One day last week we lunched at Kings Cross with John. He was polite impersonal—the Prince Consort. A ceremonious lunch. Why are we hooked to that large, rather pretentious livid bellied shark? And must I spend my last years feeding his double row of teeth? I forget. I forget what I wished to say.

K.M. effusive but less distasteful. He ruined 2 days, now I come to think of it. The sensitive plate of his mind only takes the surface. Yes, its like going to the films—the film of December 1940 talking to Kingsley. He reels off Bob Boothby: shelters; air raids; politics; not composed, but fluent. I sit with my eyes dazed. Then at meals he scrapes & sops. I cook in the damp kitchen. And the village keeps tugging & jogging. The W I. party tomorrow. My old dislike of the village bites at me. I envy houses alone in the fields. So petty so teasing are the claims of Gardners & Chavasses. I dont like—but here I stop. Italy is being crushed. Laval dismissed. No raids lately. Margot asks me to lunch & has left me Voltaire in her will."
1940.12.19,"1940 is undoubtedly coming to an end. The shortest day comes this week: then the days draw out. It wd be interesting if I could take today, Thursday, & say exactly how the war changes it. It changes it when I order dinner. Our ration of margarine is so small that I cant think of any pudding save milk pudding. We have no sugar to make sugar puddings: no pastry, unless I buy it ready made. The shops don’t fill till midday. Things are bought fast. In the afternoon they are often gone. Meat ration diminishes this week. Milk is so cut that we have to consider even the cats saucer. I spent an hour making butter from our skim of cream—a week’s takings provides about ½lb. Petrol changes the day too. Nessa can only come here when she goes to Lewes shopping. All prices rise steadily. The screw is much increased since the summer. We buy no clothes but make do with the old. These are inconveniences rather than hardships. We dont go hungry or cold. But luxury is nipped off, & hospitality. It takes thought & trouble to feed one extra. The post is the most obvious inconvenience perhaps. It takes 2 days to get a London letter: 4 to get a parcel. Turkeys impossible. The pinch is said to be worse than last war. If it increases much we shall be hungry, I suppose. Economy on Mabel means less variety in food, more dusting & L. tidying. I bicycle to Lewes instead of driving. Then the black out—thats half an hour daily drudgery. We cant use the dining room after dark. These mornings L. breakfasts in the parlour by electric light. We dip into our great jars for pickled eggs & pretend they dont taste differently. We are of course marooned here by the bombs in London. This last week the raids are so few that we forget to listen for a siren. That used to come at 6.30 punctually. No bombs fall most nights. Beaverbrook warns us that early in Feb. not only raids but invasion will come. The Germans are said to be sending troops to occupy the recumbent Italy. Whats Hitler got up his sleeve next?—we ask. A certain old age feeling sometimes makes me think I cant spend force as I used. And my hand shakes. Otherwise we draw breath as usual. And its a day when every bough is bright green & the sun dazzles me."
1940.12.20,"Is there a difference of temperature between the morning mind & the evening? If so, it will be detected in the pages that come before this, the morning pages. We have been shopping in Brighton. It is a raw cold day, with the wind rising now. And I am mooning over my Shre. chapter in R⁠[eading at] R⁠[andom] trying to find some clue: some transition from the home to the host and hostess. Biblical prose I am thinking is not colloquial. But I wont work it out: rather give it an hour or so of dumb blind life & trust it will come to the top tomorrow. We bought a duck for our Xmas luncheon. We bought some buns & a wedge of cheese. I bought Eileen Power for 6d & regret not buying a new cigarette holder—mine being foul. Yesterday we went to the village school. They make things. If Raymond had been shown the spindly striped animals he wd have said they were prehistoric—invaluable Mycenean toys. I sat beside the flushed & cushioned Mrs Jansen; also beside Mrs Hanna, & invited Mrs Ebbs to tea, for she has a picture of the Dreadnought."
1940.12.22,"How beautiful they were, those old people—I mean father & mother—how simple, how clear, how untroubled. I have been dipping into old letters & fathers memoirs. He loved her—oh & was so candid & reasonable & transparent—& had such a fastidious delicate mind, educated, & transparent. How serene & gay even their life reads to me: no mud; no whirlpools. And so human—with the children & the little hum & song of the nursery. But if I read as a contemporary I shall lose my childs vision & so must stop. Nothing turbulent; nothing involved: no introspection."
1940.12.24,"I note with some dismay that my hand is becoming palsied. Why I cant say. Can I make clear straight lines any more? It seems not. I write this by way of an experiment, indeed its less palsied this morning, but then I’ve been copying my Ms. of P.H., & am word drugged—but wont go into that. And must go in & wash & dress for the Anreps & our rather forced lunch party.

[Later] 24th Dec. Christmas Eve, & I didnt like to pull the curtains so black were Leonard & Virginia against the sky. We lunched with Helen; & again “I could have fancied living there”. An incredible loveliness. The downs breaking their wave, yet one pale quarry; & all the barns & stacks either a broken pink, or a verdurous green; & then the walk by the wall; & the church; & the great tithe barn. How England consoles & warms one, in these deep hollows, where the past stands almost stagnant. And the little spire across the fields … We sat in a ground floor garden room, untidy, littered, with the 2 oaves; & they had a spread for us. So back through Lewes. And I worshipped the beauty of the country, now scraped, but with old colours showing.

L. is now cutting logs, & after my rush of love & envy for Alciston farm house, we concluded this is the perfect place. L. says it is exactly right, for we needn’t be cumbered with possessions here. Which reminds me. We are very poor; & my hoard is 450: but must not be tapped again. So I must write. Yes, our old age is not going to be sunny orchard drowse. By shutting down the fire curtain, though, I find I can live in the moment; which is good; why yield a moment to regret or envy or worry? Why indeed?

Yesterday Octavia came with milk & cream; & Lady Oxford sent her car down with the bust of Voltaire on a book. Very heavy. An extravagant gesture on her part. And we saw the Keynes; & I cowered beneath his pugnacious positive puritan ways—A blank wall of disapproval; till I kissed him, on wh. he talked of Lydia, having a book about the ballet, in his eager, stammering way. Questions of peace remains only, he says: our victory certain. Churchill addressed the Italians."
1940.12.29,"There are moments when the sail flaps. Then, being a great amateur of the art of life, determined to suck my orange, off, like a wasp if the blossom I’m on fades, & it did yesterday—I ride across the downs to the Cliffs. A roll of barbed wire is hooped on the edge. I rubbed my mind brisk along the Newhaven road. Shabby old maids buying groceries, in that desert road with the villas; in the wet. And Newhaven gashed. But tire the body & the mind sleeps. All desire to write diary here has flagged. What is the right antidote? I must sniff round. I think Mme de Sevigné. Writing to be a daily pleasure. Charleston dumb; Leslie vocal. Anreps lunched. I detest the hardness of old age—I feel it. I rasp. I’m tart.

The foot less prompt to meet the morning dew,

The heart less bounding at emotion new,

And hope, once crush’d, less quick to spring again.



I actually opened Matthew Arnold & copied these lines [from ‘Thyrsis’]. While doing so, the idea came to me that why I dislike, & like, so many things idiosyncratically now, is because of my growing detachment from the hierarchy, the patriarchy. When Desmond praises East Coker, & I am jealous, I walk over the marsh saying, I am I; & must follow that furrow, not copy another. That is the only justification for my writing & living.

How one enjoys food now: I make up imaginary meals."
1941.01.01,"On Sunday night, as I was reading about the great fire, in a very accurate detailed book, London was burning. 8 of my city churches destroyed, & the Guildhall. This belongs to last year. This first day of the new year has a slice of a wind—like a circular saw. Leslie H. came to lunch; said um-um so often I nearly goggled; he was discussing the foundations of communism, having come chiefly to pick L.’s brain. Gossip in between; then old Octavia came, with her market womans basket. Great white bottles of milk & cream. L. looking at the comet. Rather a strong moon, & so cant identify the constellation. Mrs Coleridge Taylor tapped at the door; about a concert. And now its close on cooking time. This book was salvaged from 37: I brought it down from the shop, with a handful of Elizabethans for my book, now called “Turning a Page”. A psychologist would see that the above was written with someone, & a dog, in the room. To add in private: I think I will be less verbose here perhaps—but what does it matter, writing too many pages. No printer to consider, no public."
1941.01.09,"A blank. All frost. Still frost. Burning white. Burning blue. The elms red. I did not mean to describe, once more, the downs in snow; but it came. And I cant help even now turning to look at Asheham down, red, purple, dove blue grey, with the cross so melodramatically against it. What is the phrase I always remember—or forget. Look your last on all things lovely.

Yesterday Mrs Dedman was buried upside down. A mishap. Such a heavy woman, as Louie put it, feasting spontaneously upon the grave. Today she buries the Aunt whose husband saw the vision at Seaford. Their house was bombed by the bomb we heard early one morning last week. And L. is lecturing & arranging the room. Are these the things that are interesting? that recall; that say Stop you are so fair? Well, all life is so fair, at my age. I mean, without much more of it I suppose to follow. And t’other side of the hill there’ll be no rosy blue red snow. I am copying P.H. I am economising. I am to spend nothing. One day, 11 years ago I spent £2.2 on glass jars. That was the loosening of the purse—& I said it was difficult. Is it difficult now to string tight? The great change isnt that but the change to the country. Miss Gardner instead of Elizabeth Bowen. Small beer. But, space, silence; & time. I can sit down to a book. This I havent done since 1924, I suppose when we went to 52: & the scrimmage began. Oh but I’m so tormented by the evening beauty, & I assure you Asheham down is purple pink. And the smoke, rolling like a convoluted—should I dare to say bowel?—is incandescent. Juliette has a boy. Elaine has the measles; & to conclude the marsh is of the colour & substance of an opaque emerald. Many mad letters from adoring women. I never like or respect my admirers, always my detractors. Desmond’s book has come. Dipping I find it small beer. Too Irish, too confidential, too sloppy & depending upon the charm of the Irish voice. Yet I’ve only dipped, I say to quiet my critical conscience, which wont let me define things so easily. Bardia taken."
1941.01.15,"Parsimony may be the end of this book. Also shame at my own verbosity, which comes over me when I see the 20 it is—books shuffled together in my room. Who am I ashamed of? Myself reading them.

I answered David Cecil’s silly sneer at Lytton & Mrs Woolf, withdrawing from life to cultivate their art in quiet. The little man I suppose justifies himself by sneering at us. Then Joyce is dead—Joyce about a fortnight younger than I am. I remember Miss Weaver, in wool gloves, bringing Ulysses in type script to our tea table at Hogarth House. Roger I think sent her. Would we devote our lives to printing it? The indecent pages looked so incongruous: she was spinsterly, buttoned up. And the pages reeled with indecency. I put it in the drawer of the inlaid cabinet. One day Katherine Mansfield came, & I had it out. She began to read, ridiculing: then suddenly said, But theres some thing in this: a scene that should figure I suppose in the history of literature. He was about the place, but I never saw him. Then I remember Tom in Ottoline’s room at Garsington saying—it was published then—how could anyone write again after achieving the immense prodigy of the last chapter? He was for the first time in my knowledge, rapt, enthusiastic. I bought the blue paper book, & read it here one summer I think with spasms of wonder, of discovery, & then again with long lapses of intense boredom. Shanks borrowed it; saying it must be hidden from Bowen Hawkesford. This goes back to a pre-historic world. And now all the gents are furbishing up opinions, & the books, I suppose, take their place in the long procession.

We were in London on Monday. I went to London Bridge. I looked at the river; very misty; some tufts of smoke, perhaps from burning houses. There was another fire on Saturday. Then I saw a cliff of wall, eaten out, at one corner; a great corner all smashed; a Bank; the Monument erect; tried to get a Bus; but such a block I dismounted; & the second bus advised me to walk. A complete jam of traffic; for streets were being blown up. So by tube to the Temple; & there wandered in the desolate ruins of my old squares: gashed; dismantled; the old red bricks all white powder, something like a builders yard. Grey dirt & broken windows; sightseers; all that completeness ravished & demolished. So to Buszards where, for almost the first time, I decided to eat gluttonously. Turkey & pancakes. How rich, how solid. 4/- they cost. And so to the L.L. where I collected specimens of Eng. litre. & heard from Mr Cox how he sat over the kitchen fire at Kingston."
1941.01.20,"I will be curt, compressed. A mood like another. Back from a damp, perhaps rather strained, visit to Charleston. Nessa & Quentin; Adrian has almost died of pneumonia. Nessa apprehensive, on guard, when I spoke of Angelica’s dirt. Search for epidiascope in Lewes. Fruitless. Lecture tomorrow. 5 small trout for lunch. Octavia’s cream. Talk of soup making. Reading Gide. La Porte Etroite [1909] feeble, slaty, sentimental.

Visit from Oliver Strachey. All stocky gloom. Flogged my brain for topics. Lighted on the war. Civilisation over for 500 years. “And my life is at an end.” Enter two breezy brisk colleagues. He shares a sitting room. I lost several pages of PH. I say to Nessa, Do you find painting gets slower? Yes. One can do more. And money? Never think of it. And Helen? She does nothing. I like being alone. How can one do nothing? Duncan coming & Clive. All the same MH is somehow cheerful. Q. has an offer of a draughtsman job at Dorking. Better than farm work. The Girls school at Lewes is behind Ann of Cleves House, a large, tiled, swept, clamorous place. The headmistress large & tight, practical. “No one knows we exist” she said. I am reading—oh all lit. for my book. No answer from David, or Harper’s Bazaar. And Ethel’s letters go unread—oh dear."
1941.01.26,"A battle against depression, rejection (by Harper’s of my story & Ellen Terry) routed today (I hope) by clearing out kitchen; by sending the article (a lame one) to N.S.: & by breaking into PH 2 days, I think, of memoir writing.

This trough of despair shall not, I swear, engulf me. The solitude is great. Rodmell life is very small beer. The house is damp. The house is untidy. But there is no alternative. Also days will lengthen. What I need is the old spurt. “Your true life, like mine, is in ideas” Desmond said to me once. But one must remember one cant pump ideas. I begin to dislike introspection. Sleep & slackness; musing; reading; cooking; cycling; oh & a good hard rather rocky book—viz: Herbert Fisher. This is my prescription. We are going to Cambridge for two days. I find myself totting up my friends lives: Helen at Alciston without water; Adrian & Karin; Oliver at Bedford, & adding up rather a higher total of happiness. There’s a lull in the war. 6 nights without raids. But Garvin says the greatest struggle is about to come—say in 3 weeks—& every man, woman dog cat even weevil must girt their arms, their faith—& so on.

Its the cold hour, this, before the lights go up. A few snowdrops in the garden. Yes, I was thinking: we live without a future. Thats whats queer, with our noses pressed to a closed door. Now to write, with a new nib, to Enid Jones."
1941.02.07,"Why was I depressed? I cannot remember.

We have been to Charlie Chaplin. Like the milk girl we found it boring. I have been writing with some glow. Mrs Thrale is to be done before we go to Cambridge. A week of broken water impends. Cambridge; then Elizabeth Bowen; then Vita & Enid Jones. Helen has repaid me £25. Do I like her better for it? I think so. The snow came back. Marshes in the thaw a swamp. We were in London [on 5 February], & had to come home, owing to a bomb, by Dorking; the car was locked at Martin’s [garage]; we dined at the White Hart—poor soup & oxtail; London streets are very empty—Oxford Street a wide grey ribbon. My red purse bag stolen & L. gave me another. At Charleston Clive was stockish, like a Bell. I said “What a risk Nessa ran marrying him!” The Sitwells are proving their existence as poets in the Law Courts—This is despicable but delightful. And what else? [Ellen] Terry appears today in the N.S. The Italians are flying. The 3rd week in March is fixed for invasion. Now black out, & perhaps write to Mary. No I think read—what? I must tune up for my Elizabethans."
1941.02.16,"In the wild grey water after last weeks turmoil. I liked the dinner with Dadie best. All very lit up & confidential. I liked the soft grey night at Newnham. We found Pernel in her high ceremonial room, all polished & spectatorial. She was in soft reds & blacks. We sat by a bright fire. Curious flitting talk. She leaves next year.

Then Letchworth—the slaves chained to their typewriters, & their drawn set faces, & the machines—the incessant more & more competent machines, folding, pressing, glueing & issuing perfect books. They can stamp cloth to imitate leather. Our Press is up in a glass case. No country to look at. Very long train journeys. Food skimpy. No butter, no jam. Old couples hoarding marmalade & grape nuts on their tables. Conversation half whispered round the lounge fire. Eth Bowen arrived two hours after we got back, & went yesterday; & tomorrow Vita; then Enid; then perhaps I shall re-enter one of my higher lives. But not yet."
1941.02.26,"My ‘higher life’ is almost entirely the Elizabethan play. Finished Pointz Hall, the Pageant: the Play—finally Between the Acts this morning. Flora & Molly have just gone; leaving me to ask this bitter bright spring day, why they came?

Yesterday in the ladies lavatory at the Sussex Grill at Brighton I heard:

She’s a little simpering thing. I dont like her. But then he never did care for big women. (So to Bert) His eyes are so blue. Like blue pools. So’s Gert’s. They have the same eyes, only her teeth part a little. He has wonderful white teeth. He always had. Its fun having the boys … If he dont look out he’ll be court martialed.

They were powdering & painting, these common little tarts, while I sat, behind a thin door, p—ing as quietly as I could.

Then at Fuller’s. A fat, smart woman, in red hunting cap, pearls, check skirt, consuming rich cakes. Her shabby dependant also stuffing. Hudson’s van unloading biscuits opposite. The fat woman had a louche large white muffin face. T’other was slightly grilled. They ate & ate. Talked about Mary. But if she’s very ill, you’ll have to go to her. Youre the only one…. But why should she be?….. I opened the marmalade but John doesnt like it—And we have two pounds of biscuits in the tin upstairs…. Something scented, shoddy, parasitic about them. Then they totted up cakes. And passed the time o’ day with the waitress. Where does the money come to feed these fat white slugs? Brighton a love corner for slugs. The powdered the pampered the mildly improper. I invested them in a large house in Sussex Sqre. We cycled. Irritated as usual by the blasphemy of Peacehaven. Helen has fallen through, I mean the house I got her with Enid Jones, the day Enid lunched here, with Vita; & I felt so untidy yet cool; & she edgy & brittle. No walks for ever so long. People daily. And rather a churn in my mind. And some blank spaces. Food becomes an obsession. I grudge giving away a spice bun. Curious—age, or the war? Never mind. Adventure. Make solid. But shall I ever write again one of those sentences that gives me intense pleasure? There is no echo in Rodmell—only waste air. I spent the afternoon at the school, marbling paper. Mrs D. discontented. & said, Theres no life in these children, comparing them with Londoners, thus repeating my own comment upon that long languid meeting at Chavasses. No life: & so they cling to us. This is my conclusion. We pay the penalty for our rung in society by infernal boredom."
1941.03.08,"Just back from L.’s speech at Brighton. Like a foreign town: the first spring day. Women sitting on seats. A pretty hat in a teashop—how fashion revives the eye! And the shell encrusted old women, rouged, decked, cad⁠[a]⁠verous at the tea shop. The waitress in checked cotton.

No: I intend no introspection. I mark Henry James’s sentence: Observe perpetually. Observe the oncome of age. Observe greed. Observe my own despondency. By that means it becomes serviceable. Or so I hope. I insist upon spending this time to the best advantage. I will go down with my colours flying. This I see verges on introspection; but doesn’t quite fall in. Suppose, I bought a ticket at the Museum; biked in daily & read history. Suppose I selected one dominant figure in every age & wrote round & about. Occupation is essential. And now with some pleasure I find that its seven; & must cook dinner. Haddock & sausage meat. I think it is true that one gains a certain hold on sausage & haddock by writing them down.

Last night I analysed to L. my London Library complex. That sudden terror has vanished; now I’m plucked at by the H. Hamilton lunch that I refused. To right the balance, I wrote to Stephen & Tom: & will write to Ethel & invite myself to stay; & then to Miss Sharp who presented me with a bunch of violets. This to make up for the sight of Oxford Street & Piccadilly which haunt me. Oh dear yes, I shall conquer this mood. Its a question of being open sleepy, wide eyed at present—letting things come one after another. Now to cook the haddock."
1941.03.24,"She had a face nose like the Duke of Wellington & great horse teeth & cold prominent eyes. When we came in she was sitting perched on a 3 cornered chair with knitting in her hands. An arrow fastened her collar. And before 5 minutes had passed she had told us that two of her sons had been killed in the war. This, one felt, was to her credit. She taught dressmaking. Everything in the room was red brown & glossy. Sitting there I tried to coin a few compliments. But they perished in the icy sea between us. And then there was nothing.

A curious sea side feeling in the air today. It reminds me of lodgings on a parade at Easter. Everyone leaning against the wind, nipped & silenced. All pulp removed.

This windy corner. And Nessa is at Brighton, & I am imagining how it wd be if we could infuse souls.

Octavia’s story. Could I englobe it somehow? English youth in 1900.

Two long letters from Shena & O. I cant tackle them, yet enjoy having them.

L. is doing the rhododendrons …"
